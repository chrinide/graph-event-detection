Welwyn April 28th 1765
Sir
   I am favoured with yours by Mrs Brown; and cant help
regreting with you, & every one, the loss of our most Valuable
friend, the Great, & Good Doctor Young.
   The particulars you desire, will but add to your concern, as
every recollection does to mine; but I comply, in saying, that
the blessed Gentleman, passed a fortnight, in some distressful
circumstances, and expired on Good friday Night 1/2 past Nine,
without a groan; excuse me further, my tears prevent me, for
which I will hope your pardon.
   The good Dr, Sir, burnt most of his Manuscripts, long before
his death, & left orders that every thing of that nature shod
be destroyed, which I suppose you have by this time seen in the
public papers, with some other (I believe) genuine accounts. I
hope, Sir, you enjoy Health & every valuable blessing? & that
they may be long continued to you, for the best purposes, is
the prayer of, Sir
   Your Obliged And Most Obedient humble servant
   Mary Hallows
The good Dr retained his senses to the last.
