NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning.  They have almost no experience dealing with security, either cyber or otherwise. They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on people's fears to strengthen their position.  In any case, I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC. Look at NERC's offices.  They are in a shopping mall.  How secure is that?  Last time I visited, they didn't even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything - the whole place was wide open.  Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERC's infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers.    Contrast that with places like ISO-NE and NY-ISO, who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex. Or compare that with the MISO's hardened facility, capable of withstanding an F-4 tornado hit.  You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure.  Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous.  That's akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail.  And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider - a terrorist isn't going to attack a tariff desk, market system, or security coordinator; they will attack nuclear units, substations, and other installations that actually matter.     I echo Dave's question - do we want to \"call\" NERC on this issue?  It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERC's many security failings, including some initiatives they are currently sitting on.  Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud.  (By the way - am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of \"NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards\"?  Gotta love journalists - always trying to find an angle.  Next they'll say that the 60 in \"2600\" refers to the frequency of the interconnection!)

The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's \" Four RTO policy\" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.  Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 \"the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint.\"  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called \"NIMBA virus\".  NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to \"reliability standards.\"  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.    It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters.

{"body":" This follows up on Rick's inquiry late last week on the talks between EPSA and EEI on reliability.  Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff.  Mark did the talking.  The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation.  EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9\/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting.  EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own.  I need to read the 9\/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern.  EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC \"consensus\"), but I think EPSA staff may be \"too flexible\" in how they are approaching it.  I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing.  EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project.  It is not clear if this effort will succeed.  EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA.  EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can.  I will check with some other EPSA members.

PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to \"collect\" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its \"Est RT$\".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.  My comments are:  The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the \"HC\" or  \"Est RT$\"  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.  Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A\/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.    Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and\/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.  Alan Comnes   -----Original Message----- From: \tSteffes, James D.

{"body":"  The Barton discussion draft says that FERC's hands would be tied and that they would have to approve a proposed RTO, as to size and scope, if the proposed RTO owns or has operational control over transmission facilities that serve at least 40,000 MW of load.  Southern's CEO testified in Congress recently that their load is over 35,000.  I assume the 40,000 MW minimum would permit the SeTrans proposal to meet the proposed statutory minimum since it is Southern plus a few munis, as I understand it.  Is this correct?

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its \"Est RT$\".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.  My comments are:  The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the \"HC\" or  \"Est RT$\"  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.  Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A\/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.    Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and\/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.

{"body":" This note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the Aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill (or at least anti-mandatory RTOs) and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black, the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall.  1.  H.R. 2814 (Reps. Tom Sawyer (D-OH) and Richard Burr (R-NC))  On Aug. 2nd (the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess), the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2814, the Interstate Transmission Act.  The legislation is bad because, among other things, it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs, with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs.  Also objectionable is that the bill would \"limit\" pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a \"reasonable transition mechanism or period\" for additive charges.  The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO.  The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form, structure and operating entity of any RTO.  In addition to the RTO language, the bill has the \"old\" version of the NERC reliability legislation in it.  The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs, repeals Federal Power Act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company.  Barbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep. Sawyer's district.  Rep. Burr is from North Carolina, so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him.  I am checking into where Duke is on this issue.  Rep. Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant (see Andy Black comment below).  2.  Andy Black Meeting  Andy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation.  He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron, Reliant, Dynegy and TXU.  His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day.  If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes, the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment.  The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill, the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee.  Here is a run down of my comments and Andy's comments on specific issues.  a.   RTOs  Chairman Barton supports RTOs.  At a minimum, the draft will affirm FERC's authority as the commissioners have requested.  Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation.  Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee.  He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs.  Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps.  However, Andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above, which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs.  I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs.  Hopefully, he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects.  I will strongly encourage him to \"do the right thing\" in that regard.  b.   PUHCA  The draft will use the Pickering bill (H.R. 1101).  Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill.  Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enron's records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate.  c.  PURPA  Prospective repeal.  On back up power, they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state.  d.   Interconnection  They have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like.  I am contacting EPSA to get the details.  e.   Net Metering  They are likely to include the Inslee bill to require \"net metering.\"  I explained our concern that the bill's mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve; that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES (per Jim's helpful comments yesterday).  I need to get more information to Andy.  f.   Transmission Jurisdiction  Thankfully, Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction.  Specifically, the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundled\/unbundled issue at all.  The draft will bring munis, co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes.  g.   Siting  On siting, Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches.  h.   Reliability  On a negative note, Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e., not PJM).  I explained our concerns.  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version.  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate.  i.   Negawatts  I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list.  He said he is open to considering it again, but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the \"California bill\" earlier this summer.  Your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome.","recipient_ids":[817,818,347,812,813,1480,800,2310,2220,33830],"sender_id":1482,"datetime":997959901,"message_id":221314,"subject":"Report on \"Anti-RTO Bill\" and on Andy Black Meeting"}
{"body":" Jim --  The quick answer to your question on the Barton bill is that, yes, it does appear to address this tax issue involving interconnections, at least in part.  There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues.  One of them exludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities, specifically including connection fees.  In the example in the e-mail, the issue was not fees paid directly, but assets paid for by the generator that are then transferred to the utility.  Will check on that angle.  In any event, Title VIII (while in the Barton bill) is not in the jurisdiction of Barton's subcommittee.  Instead, the tax title would have to go through the Ways and Means Committee.  There were some energy tax provisions in the House-passed energy bill last August.  Chris and I will consult tomorrow to see if this issue was included in that bill.  Aside from the tax issue, Barton bill would require the type of interconnection rulemaking that FERC is now conducting (both for connections to local distribution and to transmission).  In each case, the cost of interconnection would have to be comparable to what the utility charges others similarly situated.  I will go back to double check, but off the top of my head I recall that the Bingaman draft specifically \"socializes\" the costs of interconnection.

ERCOT will present its agreement and procedures and EPSA will present a list of problems that members have had.  Enron worked closely with other EPSA members over the past several years on problems that we have encountered in the interconnection procedures and IAs.  EEI will also make a presentation.  (Additionally, as you are probably aware, over the past several years we have discussed problems with FERC hotline and have also had FERC staff call us to inquire about general interconnection issues -- this ANOPR is meant to address many of those issues.)  At the end of the Nov. 1 meeting, other meeting participants will have a brief amount of time to raise issues.  Donna Fulton will attend for Enron.  FERC then plans to convene a series of meetings to establish generic interconnection procedures and parts of an IA (results due to FERC Dec 14).  We will then also submit Enron comments on the ERCOT IA and procedures by Dec. 21. =20  FERC IS NOT addressing the cost issues during this stage of the proceedings; therefore, it will most likely not be dealing with the tax gross-up and crediting issues yet.  It plans to deal with cost issues in a subsequent rulemaking.  (We certainly understand that cost issues are typically the most problematic part of interconnection negotiations, but this is the way FERC wants to proceed.  FERC will continue to deal with cost issues in orders when disputed IAs are filed at FERC unexecuted.)  By way of background on ERCOT, as I understand it, ERCOT basically rolls in the interconnection costs (network-type upgrades) to the entire grid through TCOS (an uplift).  However, TCOS are not allowed to be unlimited -- ERCOT has the ability to decide whether the generator interconnection is in the best interest of the grid.  Some attribute all the new generation in ERCOT to this method.  We will need to formulate Enron's view in the next phase of the interconnection proceeding.  For Thurs. meeting, I think Donna should raise these issues: -- While certain basic aspects of the IA should be standardized to eliminate the waste of time we usually face dealing with the same problems over and over, the IA should be flexible enough to allow for individual business circumstances (for example, the notice to proceed that we have been including.)  -- While having timelines and procedures are fine, the larger problem has been getting utilities to actually follow their own filed procedures (for example, Entergy was one of the first to file procedures, yet seems to have a problem sticking to their timelines.)  This yet again means that RTOs are critical to stop the discriminatory practices and to provide incentives to treat us as customers.  --There needs to be more discussion on best practice No.2 below -- Energy resource or capacity resource.  This should be reviewed in the context of FERC's NOPR on icap (Enron just submitted comments that \"capacity\" as a separate payment is not necessary in functioning markets.  In addition, \"capacity\" is not a separately required \"payment\" in most parts of the US outside of current ISOs (ERCOT does not have icap)).  Attached is the ANOPR, ERCOT IA and procedures.  Susan Lindberg will be circulating a draft of Enron comments on the agreement and procedures.  Included on p. 11 of the ANOPR are \"best practices\" which include:  1. Comparable treatment for IPPs (allowed to be competing network resources for load without having to be designated as a \"network\" resouce) 2. Multiple interconnection products:  Energy resource and capacity resource 3. Small generator exemption 4. Queueing with reasonable milestones (10 days to correct deficiencies) 5. Deposits (with deposits over actual cost refunded) 6. Siting: TPs would post optimal and non-optimal sites for locating generators (this is something that we had asked some new ITCs to provide.  Most TPs have been reluctant to provide this service.) 7. Timelines (very similar to currently approved timelines)  Please provide any thoughts\/comments to Susan Lindberg, Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel and me.  Thanks.

Although I did not see the word \"congestion\", the implication of what I read is that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion impacts that it makes on the grid.  The implication of the last statement is that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in \"but for\" the new generator.  That is great, assuming I did not skim from too high an altitude.  Did I?  I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgotten about until recently.  That is, if the generator pays for all of this upgrade and \"but for\" stuff, and then \"gives\" it to the utility, are there taxes due on the \"gift\"?  When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the taxes on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned over to the state and fed.  (This is potentially A LOT of money to \"waste\" on an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.)  Working with Enron's tax dept (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming.  (We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.)  I understand that that IRS ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was considering.  (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.)  The point of all of this.  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection to address the tax issue?  Is it too late?  Is it irrelevant to the FERC process?  Does anyone know the status of the law making process? =20  I am concerned about taxes for two reasons.  First, many of the opponents to the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid for by the utility and  included in rate base.  (In other words, \"all generators are good and benefit the ratepayers.\")  On fundamental grounds they will resist paying for upgrades.  If they believe that they will get the insult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades), they will resist the NOPR more strenously.  (FYI to everyone, Calpine strongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it.  And guess what?  Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problems around all of the projects, just as we forecasted.  ISO is now considering adding a new zone and\/or charging PG&E and\/or the projects for congestion.  Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the grid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt.  Because all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we supported the approach in the proposed NOPR.)  Second, perhaps naively, I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades.  On a project we are now developing in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system upgrades in PG&E's system.  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the \"gift\" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmission system upgrades.  Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nice if we could get some appropriate precedence going.  Any possibliity of dealing with the tax issues in this NOPR?    -----Original Message----- From: Lindberg, Susan=20 Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 7:29 AM To: Parquet, David; Hueter, Barbara A.; Rasmussen, Dale; Dieball, Scott; Tweed, Sheila; Booth, Chris; Carnahan, Kathleen; Churbock, Scott; Comeaux, Keith; Gimble, Mathew; Grube, Raimund; Hausinger, Sharon; Inman, Zachary; Jacoby, Ben; Keenan, Jeffrey; Kellermeyer, Dave; Krause, Greg; Krimsky, Steven; Kroll, Heather; Mitro, Fred; Moore, John; Tapscott, Ron; Whitaker, Rick; Baughman, Edward D.; Coulter, Kayne; Day, Smith L.; Gilbert, Gerald; Kinser, John; May, Tom; Miller, Jeffrey; Will, Lloyd Cc: Comnes, Alan; Fulton, Donna; Nicolay, Christi L.; Novosel, Sarah; Steffes, James D.

{"body":"The New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners (NECUPUC) filed  an Answer if Support of the Motion of the Maine Public Utilities Commission  for Disclosure of Information. NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of  ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, they  would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to  the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer  subject to an appropriate protective order.    Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC  request for public information.  DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidential  information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services  Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information. Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL  markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit. If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it  should be subject to a protective order which contains the following: The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket. Only specifically named \"reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review  the information. The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises. The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.   Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast  Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited  commission action.  NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for  disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the  selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory  commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request  expedited action due the financial implications and there is also  considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in  January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending  Commission guidance.

{"body":"David,  You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance.    The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows:  \t\"Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________.\"  This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.  Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25\/33% of the rating criteria.    Given the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted.  As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C).  That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus.  If there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further, then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees, a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process.    Of course, it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race, sex, national origin, age, etc. in this process.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

{"body":"Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice  Hoyt and Melissa,  I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort  of services for MG\/RW.  It looks like there may be some key personnel we want  to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not  really familiar with the specific facts here.  The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract  personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their  activities, engaging in promotion\/discipline\/termination, etc. decisions, and  other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is  to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an  employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a  supervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.  If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers  -- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It  is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting  agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other  alternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people  who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk  of the contract workers.  I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a  definitive conclusion.  So, let's try to discuss it.  I am booked until about  11 this morning, but am available after that.

This is where an agency employee claims that  he\/she was treated like an employee, therefore he\/she should get employee  benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak).   Since we did a share purchase of MG, if the agency employees filed a suit  against MG claiming that they are really employees, I think that we would  have to defend it.  I am not an attorney, but I am going to send this to Michelle Cash, who can  advise us on the position we should take.  I would think that if we single  out certain employees to become Enron employees and the remainder stay as  agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency  employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee).

We discussed how  the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are  infact agency workers.  Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other  employees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get  applicable benefits.  The other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should  become Enron employees and should remain as agency staff.  He realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly \"muddied  the water\" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or  the agency.  He was not involved with the original decision to grant these  employees Share Options.  We discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the  specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals  Enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy  thing to do.    However, this is his ideal scenario.  How viable is it that we can do this  for him?  He also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath  Inc. and is one of his most valuable employees.

Some interesting reading. Although it doesn't explicitly relate to  foreign assignments, I am aware that our assignments to and from Europe are  predominately white males and I am assuming that this is the case globally as  well.  I am sure that if Enron was ever filed with a lawsuit for  discrimination, this could be an area that would negatively affect the  outcome of Enron's defence as foreign assignments generally provide career  development opportunities that most non-white males at Enron are missing out  on.

Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P,  10\/4\/00).  Such discrimination at the company \"is the standard operating procedure,\" the  lawsuit said.   The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job  benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about  400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees.   Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate  discrimination of any kind.   \"We take these kinds of issues very seriously,\" Murray said regarding the  lawsuit. The company has an \"active diversity policy\" and seeks to recruit  and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could  not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit.   The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who  worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former  African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct.  4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint  said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26  percent are women.   Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including  21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft  employees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said.   The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The  named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of  all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female  salaried employees at Microsoft.   \"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely  subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting  the terms and conditions of their employment\" at the company, the complaint  said. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil  Rights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are \"systemic in nature,  and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's  operations,\" the lawsuit maintains.    'Excessive Subjectivity' Alleged  The complaint said the company allows \"excessive subjectivity\" in decisions  involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against  employees in the class who complained \"either internally or externally about  Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving  unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating  them.\"   The lawsuit said the company \"uses an excessively subjective evaluation  system\" that allows managers \"who are predominantly white males, to rate  employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.\"  Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scal, but scores of  five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the  company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each  score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said.   \"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a  certain number of them must still receive the lower scores.\" Any employee  with a 2.5 score is placed on a \"personal improvement plan\" or asked to  resign, the complaint said.   \"Stack rankings\" are used to rank employees in the same job category and  organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be  ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically  higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said.   \"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal  popularity with other managers\" because the rankings mix employees working  for different managers.   In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company  also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries  \"substantially lower\" than those paid white males doing similar work, with  the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit  said.   Furthermore, \"excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria\" are applied in  promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African  Americans and female employees.

Are they a legal entity?  Are they on our payroll?   If they are we filed EEO-1's for them.    Below is the criteria to file an  EEO-1 report:  Standard Form 100 must be filed by -  A.  All private employers who are: (1) subject to Title VII of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of  1972) with 100 or more employees EXCLUDING State and local governments,  primary and secondary school systems, institutions of higher education,  Indian tribes and tax-exempt private membership clubs other than labor  organizations; OR (2) subject to Title VII who have fewer than 100 employees  if the company is owned or affiliated with another company, or there is  centralized ownership, control or management (such as central control of  personnel policies and labor relations) so that the group legally constitutes  a single enterprise, and the entire enterprise employs a total of 100 or more  employees.   B.  All federal contractors (private employers), who: (1) are not exempt as  provided for by 41 CFR 60-1.5, (2) have 50 or more employees, and (a) are  prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors, and have a contract,  subcontract, or purchase order amounting to $50,000 or more; or (b) serve as  a depository of Government funds in any amount, or (c) is a financial  institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds and  Notes.   All multi-establishment employers, i.e. employers doing business at more than  one establishment, must file: (1) a report covering the principal or  headquarters office; (2) a separate report for each establishment employing  50 or more persons; (3) a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees  by race, sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as  well as establishments with fewer than 50 employees; and (4) a list, showing  the name, address, total employment and major activity for each establishment  employ-ing fewer than 50 persons, must accompany the consolidated report.  All forms for a multi-establishment company must be collected by the  headquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for  its subsidiary holdings and submitted in one package.  For the purposes of this report, the term parent corporation refers to any  corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so  that the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiary.  The OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct  govt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or  other subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts.  Their line of  thought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits  indirectly from the contract as well.   If GSP is completely free standing  and they do not participate in Enron's benefits, abide by our policies or  procedures , participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be  funded by Enron Corp. , etc., they may have some type of argement not to  comply  but I doubt it.  If we own them over 51% I don't see a way they could  not file EEO-1's and have an AAP.  We do all the AAP's in Corporate so if  this is a freestanding Business Unit I need to know.   Thanks!

Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do      sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal      government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier'      contractor.  (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I      have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him      today.)

Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not      included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's      status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1      and AAPs.

I am concerned that bringing these employees back to work on light      duty will cause these cases to become an Enron liability rather than      an MG liability. I discussed this with Pat McCarthy, the labor and      employment law attorney we are using in NJ, and he said that the      liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought      them back . . . it would still be an MG liability, UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE      HURT HIMSELF AGAIN.

{"body":"Mike, Richard, and Gary:  What I was suggesting was that we would produce the limited items that we are proposing under the terms of the existing protective order (which are inadequate, but we are not giving up any of the crown jewels at this point) while conditioning our production on two points, first, that we reserve the right to seek stronger protection in the order (a la Williams' motion) for any subsequent materials we do agree to produce or which are compelled to be produced, and two, that the materials we are currently producing which are entitled to confidentiality (the trading data at a minimum) shall be subject to the most stringent protective order which the Commission issues in this proceeding, i.e., we get the benefit of any additional protections Williams can secure.  I only suggest this so we can stay out of the limelight by not being one of the \"bad guy\" generators who are actively taking on the protective order, when we know that at least four generators are producing nothing until their motion is resolved, and one marketer (Coral\/Shell Energy) has refused to produce transactional data and has objected to most of the document request.  I have also recently learned that Calpine has gotten an extension until Oct. 13 and will try to delay and hold off producing much data.

These generators are taking a much harder line.  Counsel for Southern has advised me that some of the generators may challenge a large part of the data request on grounds of jurisdictional, burden, and trade secret intrusion.  It seems to me that it may be best to let the generators fight for a stronger protective order, and not take their side at this time.  We might well want to consider proposing a \"most favored nations clause\" in our letter to the CPUC tomorrow in order to take advantage of what ever tighter protective order is eventually agreed to.

Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif.  ( October 17, 2000 )    Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has  come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating  capacity this summer.  The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared  and the state's power manager declared 36 separate \"power emergencies\"  because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage,  according to the investigation.  The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based  economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a  conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators  Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies  manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a  false shortage and push up prices.  The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well  below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices  ---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating  plant's cost of production.  The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an  analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors  emissions.  \"We are seeing a lot of under-generation,\" McCullough said. \"This is market  power in action.\"  Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market  participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices.  Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed  their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and  contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has  reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts.  Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal  agencies, including the EPA.  Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego  County are scant.  Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG  Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no  abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said  Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution  limits.  But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina  plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets.  \"That can't possibly be right,\" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. \"In  North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency  shutdown because of heavy output).  \"Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off,  I can't comment,\" Lloyd said.  \"We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,\" he said. \"We  don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in  California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We  want to run all we can when the prices are high.\"  Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a  doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million  customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion  in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.  State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with  a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow  beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist.  No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to  assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western  states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies  which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit  deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright  manipulation in order to increase profits.  Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity  Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff  investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they  are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data.  McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium  of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate  the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an  exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount  of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that  was actually used.  Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this  summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council,  a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web  of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western  states, British Columbia and northern Mexico.  McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North  County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was  one of deep skepticism.  \"EPA data is notoriously unreliable,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor  and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California  Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which  has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual  output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data  from the EPA.  \"Greed would get the best of anybody,\" Wolak said. \"I found a lot of hours  where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were  cranking it out.\"  Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude,  however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was  the major cause of higher prices this summer.  At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize  McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing  higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real  shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states.  Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures  in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import  electricity.  Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants  themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard  market information that is in short supply.  Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said  market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and  buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading  companies.  \"If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,\"  Eachus said.  Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the  largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the  unique stand that more information which has been labeled \"proprietary\" by  companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is  selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets.  \"Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving  rationally?\" Belden said.  \"California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody  understands,\" he said. \"If you've got nothing to hide, release the data.\"    -----  To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go  to http:\/\/www.nctimes.com (c) 2000, North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

{"body":"While I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible, the  matter here is complicated by the fact that FERC's discovery rules (18 CFR,  Subpart D) pertain only to \"proceedings set for hearing . . . and to such  proceedings as the Commission may order.\"  18 CFR 385.401.  In this case,  FERC stated that \"a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . .\" and  specifically rejected the use of a \"trial-type evidentiary hearing.\"  Slip  op. at 47-48 & n.97.  Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my  preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery  processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order  and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case.   (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it  specifically attempts to equate \"paper\" hearings with \"trial-type\" hearings;  see page 1 of its Motion.)  The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery  in this case under Rule 401.  While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly  to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or  someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties.  As a result, we  need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to  present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing  with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that  Staff has already conducted.  >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11\/08\/00 10:31AM >>> Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not  included in the list of subject companies:  Exh.

{"body":"Bruce this memo is dealing with the merits of litigation v arbitration to  resolve DPC's DSU claim for the first set of rotor problems. Recall that we  tried to negotiate a settlement with insurers for some time and then UI  served DPC with a notice of arbitration because of the threat of a bad faith  claim.  I think I summarized it earlier for you, but essentially we now have  the choice of pursuing litigation in London against insurers since United  India has now sued us in London Court (in addition to arbitration because  they figured out a little late that under the policy, only quantum may be  arbitrated and they don't want to admit liability).  Our option before was  only to sue them in India which really isn't an option which is why we agreed  to arbitration.  Basically UI can't decide what it wants to do, but this memo  from Linklaters sets forth DPC's options which Justin, Ken Blades and  I  discussed regarding the pros and cons of litigation v arbitration.  It's a  complex mess and I'll be glad to sit down and explain it to you  (or not),  but we are basically writing to UI's counsel to try and determine what their  position is and then we'll decide whether to litigate or arbitrate.

{"body":"In the Room  Conference attended by all in-state generators, a few munies, the IOUs and a  few others. One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended  for CA Large Consumers.  Nader sent someone.  No other consumers.  One other  ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego). Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the  IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The  prices are quite divergent.  He expresses concern at the little offered. Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible  on terms (FERC required 24\/7 offers). IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g.,  BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so. Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now. Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part  existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with  the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate  increase. Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough Enron able to take low profile. SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing  could be achieved. Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed  epithets at SDG&E and SCE.  SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning.    Out of the Room  Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators. Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs. Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC  involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable  resolution.  Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks  Judge asked everyone to consider how to \"Share the Pain\" for Thursday's  meeting and said not to expect any \"win:win\" scenario. His view is that FERC  is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court. His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in  12\/1\/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its  supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward  contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates.  Generators oppose  this, I believe. Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA.","recipient_ids":[36,1735,3120,3121,3122,3123,3124,213,3125,168,1749,1456,3126,1475,782,5099,13265,590,3128,3129,1648,3130,770,1696,2156,802,2319,2222,25038,1489,1673,3132,3133,3134,1476,1474,1180,2500,1464,1629,3135,3136,3137,3138,3139,3140,3141,208,1680,23304,7213,34229,1016,3142,181,3143,3144,1672,817,3145,55,28783,5087,8546,813,1620,1746,3148,8431,34197,3149,4796,17529,37,3151,2318,2370,3152,4854,7213,1485,253,9244,4001,3164,3153],"sender_id":801,"datetime":978529200,"message_id":232926,"subject":"Update Day 1 Second Session FERC CA Settlement"}

On another issue that came up on the call this morning Ken, I was asking  Justin about governing law specifically because I wanted to know if there was  any law (India or English) requiring insurers to disclose information  regarding risk to the insured, so we could cite some law perhaps to compel  Beachcrofts to hand over the Liburdi report.   For example, the Texas  insurance code has evolved from a vague \"duty of good faith & fair dealing\"  standard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing  certain things detrimental to the insured.  Justin tells me English law, in  this regard, consists only of precedential case law, but it still could be  helpful.  Because of the commercial risk (outside the ambit of arbitration in  the instance) it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London  Commercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United  India from withholding this information which is critical to running these  machines.   If, in fact,  there truly is a 50% chance of failure in these  machines, yet they won't share that evidence with us, this is a commercial  risk DPC can't afford, regardless of coverage and apart from the  arbitration.  (I'm wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today).   Although Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction, United India did us the  favor of bringing  suit in London Commercial Court earlier, and thus having  availed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirst's emphatic witness  statement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction, I  think it is worth considering  if they continue to refuse to give us the  report in response to Justin's latest correspondence.  I don't think we can  afford to sit on our hands on this one.  Why don't you and Neil kick this  around, (since you don't have enough to do already).

The position on the insurance is that it does not specify a governing law. On an application of English private international law (ie conflict of laws rules) there is uncertainty whether it would be English or Indian law. At para 42 of Hirst's statement, he says that the contracts are impliedly subject to English law (based on London as the arbitration forum?). Certainly, my preference in terms of certainty would be English law. However, it is possible there could be an advantage to Indian substantive law and once we get UI's statement of claim, we should give thought to whether it would be worthwhile getting Indian law input on whether there could be advantage in arguing Indian law.

{"body":"USA: UPDATE 1-Calif. seizes stranded SoCal Edison energy contracts.    02\/02\/2001  Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2001.    SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - California Gov. Gray Davis on Friday blocked  the California Power Exchange from liquidating stranded energy contracts held  by cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison, seizing the assets for  the state.   The governor's office said the order, issued late on Thursday and put in  effect on Friday, was needed to \"preserve\" the contracts' value for  power-starved California consumers.   \"I am using my emergency powers to seize options to buy very inexpensive  power that would otherwise be lost forever,\" Davis said in a statement.   \"These options will provide reliable power through the end of the year. It is  important to protect these contracts for the people of California,\" he said.   A Los Angeles judge on January 24 issued a temporary injunction, valid for a  week, blocking the exchange's sale of the contracts.   The California Power Exchange (CalPX) said Davis' order nullified a Los  Angeles County Superior Court decision earlier Friday that authorized CalPX  to liquidate Edison's forward market positions.   The exchange said they had sought to liquidate the contracts to recover about  $255 million that Edison has failed to pay to CalPX market participants.   While agreeing to transfer the contracts to the state, the exchange pointed  out that the law requires that California pay a \"reasonable value\" for them,  which it estimated at nearly $652 million on today's market.   Delivery of the first contracts, which total 2.8 million megawatt hours, is  scheduled to begin Monday, February 5.   One megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to light 1,000  homes for 60 minutes.   Davis is desperately seeking cheap power for the state after the utilities'  financial meltdown pushed them to the market's sidelines. Spot market  purchases for the state are currently being made by the Department of Water  Resources, but at typically higher prices than in the \"forwards\" market.   Block forward energy contracts secure electricity deliveries over a given  \"block\" of time at a price agreed months in advance, shielding the buyer from  the kind of price volatility that has recently roiled the short-term \"spot\"  market.   The overall value of SoCal Edison's contracts, agreed last year for power to  be delivered in 2001, was not immediately known, but CalPX officials said  last month they hoped their liquidation would cover the $215 million  SoCalEdison owned the exchange.   SoCal Edison, the utility subsidiary of Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison  International, has warned it is no longer able to meet its financial  obligations after running up a debt of nearly $5 billion buying wholesale  power in the spot market, where prices have soared ten-fold over the past few  months amid a regional energy shortage.   The utility is blocked by the state's 1996 deregulation law from passing  these high wholesale prices down to consumers, who are still protected by a  rate freeze.   That same deregulation legislation created the CalPX, making it the  state-sanctioned exchange for electricity trading. SoCal Edison was among the  biggest buyers on the exchange.   CalPX, crushed by a mountain of debt it is unable to recover from Edison, has  shut its spot market operations and is winding down its business affairs.

{"body":"I attended the U.C. Berkeley POWER (Program on Workable Energy Regulation) Conference on March 16.  Here is a brief report on the relevant parts. Notably, the Lieff, Cabreser duo of Bill Bernstein and Barry Himmelstein were there, listening carefully.  The program consisted of the presentation of 8 economic studies, followed by comments from two discussants, followed by audience questions\/comments.  The following is a list of the papers and the discussants who presented with slides, taken from the website of the U.C. Energy Institute, http:\/\/www.ucei.berkeley.edu\/ucei\/conf2001\/order_papers2001.html:  You can click on this to see the slides, in PDF format.  The papers in green are not particularly relevant for our purposes, and I won't say more about them beyond the note in brackets.  The presenter's name is in bold.    \"Bidding Asymmetries in Multi-Unit Auctions: Implications of Bid Function Equilibria in the British Spot Market for Electricity\" by Greg Crawford, Duke University, Joe Crespo, NERA, and Helen Tauchen, University of North Carolina   \"Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity Market\" by Steve Puller, UC Berkeley    Discussion by Anjali Sheffrin, California Independent System Operator   \"Identification and Estimation of Cost Functions Using Observed Bid Data: An Application to Electricity Markets\" by Frank Wolak, Stanford University [A paper about economic \"tools\" to study power markets.]   \"Forward Contracts and the Curse of Market Power\" by Jeffrey Lien , University of Maryland   \"The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San Diego\" by James Bushnell and Erin Mansur, UC Berkeley [This looks at whether consumption declined with price increases.  Not much.]   \"Consumption and Home Energy Costs: How Prevalent is the 'Heat or Eat' Decision?\" by Julie Berry Cullen, University of Michigan, Leora Friedberg, University of Virginia, and Catherin Wolfram, UC Berkeley [A macro study on how consumers change overall spending patterns when they have to shell out more $$ for power.]   \"A Quantitative Analysis of Pricing Behavior in California's Wholesale Electricity Market During Summer 2000\" by Paul Joskow, MIT, and Edward Kahn, Analysis Group   \"Electricity Restructuring and the Cost of Pollution Reduction\" by Dallas Burtraw, Karen Palmer, Ranjit Bharvirkar, and Anthony Paul, Resources for the Future  Before I discuss the specific papers and presenters, one big picture point needs to be made.  There was an unchallenged consensus at this conference that the generators have exercised market power to the tune of billions of dollars.  The focus was on how and how much, not whether.  The good news is that I heard no evidence supporting any collusion theory; the thought was that generators are making independent output and pricing decisions knowing they could influence the market price given the auction rules and the completely inelastic demand.  On the other hand, I would have to say that the economic work on the tacit collusion hypothesis in incomplete at best. The bad news is that the scale of potential overcharges is pretty staggering -- >$5 billion.  The plaintiffs will be able to put together quite a damage study.  Crespo, Bidding Asymmetries in UK:  This is a marginally relevant paper examining whether bidders in the UK electricity auction markets behaved in a leader-follower mode, i.e., asymmetrically.  Crespo's model shows that in a uniform price-setting auction with clearing price rules, a price setter will emerge and take all prices above marginal cost.  Thus, above marginal cost pricing does not require coordination.  Crespo (from NERA) appeared knowledgeable, but is not an inspiring speaker.  His paper also got roughed up a bit in the audience questioning segment.  Puller, Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity Market:  This is a very relevant paper, as it tries to determine whether market power (presumably) exercised in California was static or dynamic, meaning the product of individual firm decisionmaking (static) or tacit collusion (dynamic).  The period studied was 4\/98 to 12\/99.  Puller found evidence of static market power consistent with so-called \"Cournot pricing.\" This theory posits that in an oligopoly firms will take their rivals' observed price\/output decisions as a given and decide how to maximize profitability given that behavior.  He then tried to determine whether any dynamic games were occurring, meaning a game where firms recognize their interdependence and try to follow a \"supergame trigger strategy\" in which firms try to induce favorable responses from rivals.  It's quite complicated how he goes about this, but fundamentally he tries to correlate observed output decisions with how a firm at that time might have expected a change in its behavior to affect its future share of the market.  With this methodology, Puller finds what he called \"weak evidence\" of forward-looking dynamic pricing for a brief time in 1998, but not otherwise.  My impression was that the evidence for 1998 was very weak, and the logic used to arrive at this conclusion was also weak.  Puller then went at this a second time with a theory that attempts to determine what a firm's \"supply function\" would look like if it was exercising static and dynamic market power, and then comparing this to an estimate of that firm's actual supply function.  I found this even more speculative than the first theory.  Nonetheless, the results are basically the same:  evidence of static, but not dynamic market power.  Puller took a lot of heat for the methodology of this paper during the questioning segment.  He's not a dynamic speaker and does not appear to me to be a strong expert candidate.  Anjali Sheffrin's commentary was very important.  She is the Director of Market Analysis for CAISO.  After general comments on Crespo and Puller, she launched in to a discussion of whether their models explained the California experience.  This turned out to be a preview of the CAISO FERC filing of last week, in which they allege $5.5 billion in market power-related overcharges from May 200 to Feb. 2001.  That filing and Sheffrin's report follow.  They are essential reading.    <<2001032214541122276.pdf.pdf>>  <<2001032214585222924.pdf.pdf>>  Sheffrin maintains that it was the absence of imports during this period that left the market power of the California generators unchecked.  This permitted the in-state generators to engage in either economic or physical withholding of power.  (Economic withholding is bidding a higher-than-needed supply curve; physical withholding is cutting output at the plant.)  Her study was intended to (1) Identify individual firms engaging in market power activity, and (2) Analyze how each firms' actions set market clearing prices.  She utilized full bidding data in CA ISO real time market for each hour between May and Nov 2000, defined and categorized bidding patterns and identified economic or physical withholding, and then calculated bid-cost mark-up and a monopoly rent.  She found what she claimed was strong evidence of both types of withholding, but that economic withholding is the dominant bidding pattern used by the five large California generators. While Sheffrin's study does not name names, it claims that \"most of the five in-state suppliers and many of the [16] large importers displayed bidding patterns which were consistent with the exercise of market power.\"  Bernstein and Himmelstein were positively gleeful during this presentation.  On the question of collusion, Sheffrin's study is not terribly illuminating. She maintains that \"the dominant bidding pattern is consistent with two characteristics of a supply function equilibrium model of oligopolist pricing.\"  I take that to mean Cournot, which is a static, non-collusive model.  However, when you read her study, you'll see the picture is not entirely clear.  Lien, The Curse of Market Power:  This is only marginally relevant for us, as its thesis is that forward-looking supply contracts are better for both producers and society.  Everyone seemed to agree -- and were confused why we needed a paper to prove it.  Lien (U. Md.) is young and not expert material.  Joskow and Kahn:  http:\/\/www.mit.edu\/people\/pjoskow\/JK_PaperREVISED.pdf (paper);  http:\/\/www.ucei.berkeley.edu\/ucei\/conf2001\/Slides\/Kahn_Slides.pdf (Kahn's slides).   I'm sure many of you have already read this; everyone should.  Prepared for SoCal Edison, it contends that 4 in-state generators (Reliant, Dynegy, AES\/Williams, and Southern\/Mirant) exercised market power by withholding capacity during the summer or 2000.  J&K use publicly available data on loads, market prices and generation to (a) quantify combined effects of \"market fundamentals\" on market prices, (b) calculate \"price gap\" (difference between actual prices and \"competitive\" market benchmarks), (c) account for quantify effects of ISO's ancillary services requirements and forced outages, and then (d) calculate the \"output gap\" for high priced hours, meaning the difference between observed and maximum profitable levels of generation.  They conclude that prices were far in excess of the competitive benchmark and that the 4 in-state generators could have produced more power at competitive prices but chose not to. Hence, market power was exercised.  Kahn, the Analysis Group economist who presented, is a very colorful and rather undisciplined advocate of his position.  He threw around allegations of conspiracy rather casually, but mostly to be funny.  I couldn't tell whether he believed his study proved that; I don't think it even speaks to it.  But Bernstein and Himmelstein applauded him when he finished, grinning ear to ear.  Severin Borenstein, UC Berkeley and the conference director, was supposed to comment on J&K, but hardly did.  He said that the generators would have been stupid not to exercise market power given the supply\/demand conditions and the market rules, and argued that permitting long term contracts and requiring real-time residential pricing were the solutions to all of this. Borenstein was the best expert material I saw at this conference, and the fact he took a pass on the details of the J&K paper is puzzling to me.  It made me wonder whether he already has a horse in this race, or perhaps is trying to \"stay above it all.\"  Hope this is useful.  Regards, Dan  Daniel M.

{"body":"After speaking with George Phillips yesterday about SCE's counterclaim against EES and EEMC regarding underreporting of usage to the ISO, I think there may be some internal confusion (of which I may have contributed to) about the nature of SCE's counterclaim.  As I understand, from my review of certain documents received from SCE in response to our data requests, review of an \"Executive Summary\" prepared by George Phillips on the issue, and from my conversation with him yesterday, EES and EEMC, as a result of some problems with their settlement system, did indeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time period claimed by SCE.  This has, I believe, resulted in two separate (although interrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is the subject matter of its counterclaim.  First, the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) charges to the market.  In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during the last quarter of 2001, it appears that SCE was calculating the \"cost to the market\" from the  EES\/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day ahead market clearing price to the  individual  hourly variances.  This cost to the market is overestimated, however, as SCE failed to take into account the fact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accounts to get a net amount of underreporting.  This underreported amount is then allocated to all providers of physical load within a service territory through the assessment of UFE charges.  Thus whatever the ultimate cost was determined to be, SCE would not be allocated the entire amount.  Second, the underreporting of usage to the ISO results, according to SCE, in SCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased.  This claim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES\/EEMC cost the market in the way of UFE charges.  What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES and EEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy which they reported to the ISO.  EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more than the amount which EES and EEMC reported.  SCE calculated the PX credit based on the amount used, not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC are not entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market, not EES and EEMC, purchased those volumes.  It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter of SCE's counterclaim.  SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PX credit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase.  SCE is claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO.  While SCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the result of  EES\/EEMC underreporting, the UFE charges are not the basis of its counterclaim.  Based on the above analysis, I think that the most critical piece of information  to refute the counterclaim is that, despite the underreporting of volumes to the ISO, EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DA customers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim?  and do we have data to back it up?

An explanation (in draft) of the Dutch power market and the events  leading up to the current market \"squeeze\" by certain players, which we have  produced and discussed for our external lawyers.  2.  A schematic of arguments which we produced for external lawyers before  Christmas just relating to the mis-application of capacity by TenneT.  3.  A copy of our e-mail to Clifford Chance of last Wednesday summarising the  issues in order of priority for their advice.  Please note that, purely on the swap element of this jigsaw, we are  attempting to arrange a conference with a Queen's Counsel for next Monday  afternoon.  Hence, it may be better for our meeting (with Jeff patched-in) to  take place next Tuesday - clearly the advice on all the elements involved (as  set out in 3) in toto will not be complete until we have had the conference  with the QC.

Please note the following when planning our legal strategy:  - Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited (\"ECTRL\") (an English incorporated  company) is our company which has entered into physical electricty sales  contracts to supply certain Dutch Distribution Companies. The physical supply  contracts are governed by Dutch law and are subject either to ICC arbitration  in either Paris, Rotterdam or the Hague or the NAI in Rotterdam or the Hague  (dependant upon the counterparty).   - ECTRL is also a Participant on the APX.  - Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (\"ECTRIC\") (a company  incorporated  in Delaware, U.S.) is the Enron entity which, as principal,  enters into financial swaps, arranged through Enron Europe Finance & Trading  Limted (\"EEFT\") (an English incorporated company which is regulated by the  SFA),  with, among others,  Dutch Distribution companies.   The swap  contracts have all been documented on a \"Deemed\" ISDA basis (representative  confirms have already been sent to you on this aspect).  Clearly although the first three issues are \"TOP PRIORITY\", the Secondary  Priority Issues are not far behind them and so we should be obliged to  receive your consolidated written report on all the issues on or before  Wednesday, 26th January, as we discussed yesterday.  When providing that  report, please also let us have at the same time estimates of your fees for  the whole of your team (incl. London and the US) (\"ball-parks\" are fine at  present) broken down into:  - fees for Clifford Chance's preliminary advice, including the written  strategy report;  - fees for Clifford Chance prosecuting the Sep take-or-pay issues;  - fees for Clifford Chance prosecuting the APX issues;  - fees for Clifford Chance prosecuting any actions \/ defences \/ counterclaims  on the swaps and \/ or physical contracts.  Fee estimates for Clifford Chance prosecuting any of the Secondary Priority  issues can come later.            Please also pay particular attention to how we might obtain evidence to the  appropriate standard of market rigging on the APX etc., conspiracy, etc, re  defence \/ counterclaim to any non-payment by Enron on the Swaps (see Points 2  + 3 below).     1. IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Query: What  Court actions do we have against TenneT  and \/ or SEP re allocation of capacity by TenneT   to SEP for Yr 2000 in  November 1999?   Issue 1 - Miss-allocation by TenneT of 1500 MW of cross-border capacity by  TenneT to SEP (first step in allocation which defined quota of balance of   cross-border capacity available to the market)   Issue 2 - Unlawful speculative reservation or other unlawful reservation of  capacity by SEP (e.g. re non take-or-pay elements).       Issue 3 - Unlawful retention and \/ or unlawful application of capacity by  SEP once granted capacity by TenneT (blocking of essential facilities,  i.e.,   generation, to other parties)  Resolution required:  The quickest way possible to deny Sep right to use TenneT capacity for  non-take or pay elements (nb relevant take or pay is energy component ie  obligation to import at border cf take or pay on \"virtual\" capacity) as soon  as possible The quickest way possible to have that capacity released to the APX in  accordance with existing \"use it or lose it\" principle or TenneT to allocate  to term market under \"weekly\" contract category established by DTE as soon as  possible.   Evidence:  Herkstroter report (implied), 1999 despatch regime (implied),  general market \"consensus\", electricity plans?, DTE consultation paper on  transmission (reference to virtual power plants), EZ\/DTE advice which limited  reservation to take or pay (hence only needed if some parts were non take or  pay).  Current despatch levels on term deals (imply Sep taking 1500 MW).   Query method of putting all of this in evidence, \"discovery\" etc.      (PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ALREADY INCLUDED AS AN ISSUE IN THE EXISTING NMA  COMPLAINT AGAINST TENNET (NOT SEP AT PRESENT) IN RESPECT OF ITS ALLOCATION  PROCESS ON COMPETITION GROUNDS COMMENCED THROUGH LOEFF CLAEYS IN DEC 1999).  Points to note :  (1) Initial Clifford Chance view - Summary proceedings  against TenneT & Sep.  Time-line needed of when to commence,      length of  time to get to Court, ? best methodology of getting Sep contracts before the  Court, etc        (2) Query value of Clifford Chance initial letter to TenneT and \/ or Sep  requesting confirmation that all Sep contracts are full      take-or-pay.   2. IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Query: Preparation of  Draft proceedings against the  APX   Issue 1 - Drafting of summary proceedings by ECTRL as a Participant against  APX for failing to enforce & to compel them to enforce the APX Rules on    ensuring firm cross-border capacity pre-bid & to prevent market manipulation.      Note failure of APX to enforce its Rules causes losses both to:    (a) ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany (and Belgium) by  virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by    ECTRL by  breaching APX rules Art 12.1 etc.       (b) ECTRL on its physical supply contracts (as prices on the APX are  artificially higher than contracted supply price);    plus    (c) ECTRIC on swaps - ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX  Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX,    causing  artificially high prices, hence securing more profit out of the swaps.     Issue 2 - Query availability of shareholder (10%) action by ECTRL (in  concert with others) as shareholders of the Exchange against APX for      mis-management in failing to enforce APX Rules leading to (a) damage to  certain  Participants and \/ or (b) damage to APX's prospects as a main    European power exchange.     Resolution required \/ Tactics: (1) APX has published certain cross-border  transmission contract \"audit\" requirements which are to come into  effect       on 20.1.2000 (copy will faxed shortly) - we query effectiveness  of this \"compromise\" approach plus there isnothing       specific mentioned  re other manipulative conduct (e.g., \"crossing\").  Hence, Issue 1 above  required to be done       as, if APX measures fail, then we may need to file  suit quickly to bring matters to a head.              (2) IMPORTANT - Irrespective of whether or not APX audit prevents  manipulation etc., need to consider taking       appropriate actions  againstAPX  or others in any event asap in order to flush out evidence re  manipulation \/       conspiracy among certain Participants re any defence \/  counterclaims to any non-payment on swaps etc - see        3 below.            (3) Query benefit at this stage of shareholder letter to APX \"setting  scene\" for mis-management corporate action       Points to note: Time-line needed of when to commence, length of time to get  to Court., etc, plus, re (2) above, ? best methodology of gathering  sufficient    evidence in due time for defence \/ counterclaims on swap issues  - see 3 below.     3. IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Query:  Do we have any legitimate grounds for  non-performing on our swap contracts \/ physical contracts,  and  what should  be our strategy re this (e.g., pre-emptive actions or defensive actions \/  counterclaims)?     Note: certain counterparties to contracts with Enron are causing loss to  Enron by, what we believe, is market manipulation of APX, collusion to  lock-up  market etc.  Certain other parties to such contracts with Enron we  do not believe are party to such conduct.  Losses to Enron are however  occurring as  follows:           (a) to ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany (and Belgium) by  virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by    ECTRL by  breaching APX rules Art 12.1 etc.       (b) to ECTRL on its physical supply contracts (as prices on the APX are  artificially higher than contracted supply price);    plus    (c) ECTRIC on swaps - ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX  Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX,    causing  artificially high prices, hence securing more profit out of the swaps.    Issue 1 - Can ECTRIC legitimately withhold payments on the swaps?     - Query:  availability of pre-emptive damages or other forms of action(s)  against swap counterparties     -  Query: best jurisdiction (esp. re swaps - English, Dutch US)?  Resolution needed:  need to obtain from a strategic perspective best  jurisdiction(s) and best course and causes of action on a pre-emptivebasis as  far as    possible - to avoid claims of forum shopping and bring maximum  pressure; plus advice needed on whether we should take pre-emptive    action  or to defend and \/ or counterclaim if we get sued if we do not perform on  swaps or physical contracts.   Initial Clifford Chance view:  None \/ no suitable  pre-emptive action  available to Enron - defences \/ counterclaims only.  All proceedings likely  to be in England and subject to contracts' governing law (English) (under Art  17 Brussels' convention + Dutch conflict of laws principles).  Highly  unlikley that any U.S. action by Enron practically possible - U.S. courts  will consider forum shopping (unless can show that Dutch counterparty has  \"minimum contacts in the US\" (?means in detail?) - even then, U.S. courts  unlikely to give any appropriate relief - query enforcement problems in any  event.   Clifford Chance's initial \"gut reaction\" is to withhold payment -  wait for counterparty to sue which would probably be by way of summary  judgement (approx 2 - 3 months to get court in England).  If so, to defeat  summary proceedings thus delaying matters to full trial, ECTRIC would then  need to establish prima facie case for either defence on breach of  implied  term (v. difficult indeed but \"gut reaction\" is that London Commercial Court  could be swayed by an argument that actual counterparty has acted in bad  faith, e.g., manipulated mkt - fairly untested area) and \/ or counterclaim  for conspiracy to defraud (for which need to establish prima facie case of  conspiracy between counterparty and others to rig the mkt, etc).  Notes: (1) Need to thoroughly investigate all options here (approx 70 % of  losses could be on the swaps)   (2) Need to consider evidence re mkt rigging \/ conspiracy to defraud,  practically whether this could effectively be brough to light by any  actions   against APX - see Issue (2)  of Point 2 APX above -  the \"race\"  between timescales of summary judgment in England versus any actions  against   APX under Dutch law to flush out evidence .  Any additional ways of  securing appropriate evidence to the relevant standard of proof (whether    through crt actions or otherwise) - whether in the UK, US or in the  Netherlands - and timescales?  E.g., availability of putting people on the  \"Witness   Stand\" in the Netherlands      (3)  Queries re Clifford Chance initial view:    (a) Repercussions - action by counterparty not by way of summary judgment  but by way of filing insolvency petition under Section 123  IA    1986    (b) Any views altered re amenability of commercial crt if (i) Enron knew  last year that APX could be manipulated + if Enron itself had enterd into     similar, but smaller-scale, manipulation for short period last year?     (4) Check: Ability of Dutch counterparties to swaps to speculate rather than  hedge by way of OTC Derivatives and any good faith\/integrity issues re'    parties use of speculative cf hedging swaps combined with deliberate and  systematic market manipulation by swap counterparts.   (5) Query:  Any SFA repercussions for EEFT?    Issue 2 - Liability of ECTRL under physical supply contracts.    - Does 20% liability cap on physical contracts work if ECTRL fails  intentionally to deliver?    - Does consequential losses exclusion on phyiscal contracts work if ECTRL  fails to deliver?                - Strategy (i.e., should we fail to deliver, pay undisputed amount of bill  and dispute rest of bill and let counterparty take us to arbitration?  OR,  can    this have any adverse repercussions re any other opart of our legal  strategy?)        4. SECONDARY PRIORITY - Query: What actions do we have against TenneT to  recoup our losses re allocation of capacity by   TenneT for Yr 2000 in  November 1999?  Issue 1 - Misapplication in law of capacity (i.e. 800 MW) by TenneT to Market  parties (e.g., Enron) after Sep allocation : allocation favoured incumbents  based on market share - this caused a new entrant such as Enron loss.  Issue 2 - General unreasonable behaviour \/ lack of good faith of TenneT Misleading market with early rules; addition of extra unfounded rules post 19  Nov (in reasonable knowledge that market parties had already acted on earlier  information from TenneT). 1,2 Jan 2000 : closing Dutch market to imports (query whether this was also  for the UCTE system support activities; suspect not) in an unreasonable  fashion ie changed procedures when it had no need so to do.  The normal  procedures whereby TenneT curtailed in the event of a problem on the day  would have been sufficient to maintain system stability. Disingenous allocation of 2300 MW in off-peak capacity (night) at the same  time as indicating to the market that no more than 1000 or 1200 MW was  expected by TenneT to be available for use due to Sep's plant despatch  regime.  Reasonable action would have been to allocate no more than the 1000  MW to Sep and the market on a term basis with any additional capacity  available on a given day treated as (uncertain) spot capacity and allocated  to the APX. Lack of checking and\/or other disingenuity re' failure properly to check Sep  take or pay obligations. Lack of transparency of information eg French grid problems result in cut of  300 MW available to APX.  No assistance from TenneT either to provide  guidance as to the real extent or duration of the problem or to take  reasonable steps to mitigate the problem by eg co-operating with market  parties aiming to put in place offsetting transit arrangements to alleviate  the congestion.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO THE SAME EXISTING NMA COMPLAINT  ON COMPETION GROUNDS REFERRED TO IN 1. ABOVE COMMENCED THROUGH LOEFF CLAEYS  IN DEC 1999.  Resolution required:  Damages against TenneT  Evidence:  Herkstroter report (implied), 1999 despatch regime (implied),  general market \"consensus\", electricity plans?, DTE consultation paper on  transmission (reference to virtual power plants), EZ\/DTE advice which limited  reservation to take or pay (hence only needed if some parts were non take or  pay).  Current despatch levels on term deals (imply Sep taking 1500 MW).  Sep  newspaper quotes (intent to use 1500 MW day and night) - intended block on  capacity and refusal to contemplate change to superpeak pricing.  Query  method of putting all of this in evidence, discovery etc.    5. SECONDARY PRIORITY -  Query:  ability of Enron to claim damages against  APX for losses suffered owing to failure of APX to enforce its Rules and to  allow gaming, etc.  Note failure of APX to enforce \/ have enforced its Rules causes losses both  to:  (a) ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany (and Belgium) by virtue  of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching  APX rules Art 12.1 etc.     (b)  ECTRL on its physical supply contracts (as prices on the APX are  artificially higher than contracted supply price); plus  (c)  ECTRIC on swaps - ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX  Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX, causing  artificially high prices, hence securing more profit out of the swaps.]        Resolution required:  Damages against the APX   6. SECONDARY PRIORITY - Query: Actions against APX Participants for  manipulating the APX DAM causing losses to Enron  Note manipulation of APX DAM by certain Participants causes losses both to:  (a) ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany (and Belgium) by virtue  of others parties preventing legitimate level of sales by ECTRL by breaching  APX rules Art 12.1 etc.   (b) ECTRL on its physical supply contracts (as prices on the APX are  artificially higher than contracted supply price); plus  (c) ECTRIC on swaps - ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX  Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX, causing  artificially high prices, hence securing more profit out of the swaps.   Resolution required:  What action can we take against APX Participants (i) to  prevent them further manipulating APX and (ii) claiming our losses against  them on both ECTRL's physical supply contracts and ECTRIC's swaps?         In particular:   Query:  availability of injunction \/ summary proceedings  against APX Participants to prevent them from manipulating APX DAM   7.

Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\" Content-Disposition: inline  IS TRADING AN INSIDER'S GAME? Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is  stacked against consumers   By Craig D. Rose STAFF WRITER  June 6, 2001    While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive  market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly  growing business of buying and selling power among themselves.  The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere  around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems.  Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising  consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated.  \"Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to change  the stock price,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor  and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group.  Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power  provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricity,  lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free  market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like  electricity.  But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm.  In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders to  collude and raise prices under the guise of competition.  To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as stars  in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not  uncommon.  The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical  commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES  Corp.'s California plants.  In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants that  gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity,  the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Williams  Cos.  Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla.,  company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.  It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Sempra  Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp.,  the nation's biggest electricity trader.  A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased  some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guard  their positions.  This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less than  5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the  wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for  consumers that was 300 percent higher.  Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter this  year.   Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences. In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companies  such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and  others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their  electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their  trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's  electricity inventory.  Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its  trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits,  which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.  It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to  increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market conditions.  Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One  of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of  competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the production  side of the business.  For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is  indistinguishable from that generated by others.  More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built  by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different  companies produce power at nearly identical cost.  \"The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil  (one-thousandth of a dollar),\" said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray  Davis and former president of Southern California Edison.  So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on  trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or even  better, rising sharply.   Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning  electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from  energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least  little that has been of concern to FERC.  In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold  from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a  trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted  once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without  admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up  prices.  FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast  to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the  Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But William  Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate.  \"Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up,\" Massey said. \"It's an  extraordinarily complicated market.  \"The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're  kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket ships  flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessarily  produce reasonable prices. They produce profits.\"  Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated  utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill  electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for  profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened  the market.  Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of  California's major utilities and Wall Street firms.   Market volatility In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities.  But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its use  is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all. When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to  budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that it  charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity  that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.  Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove,  who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies to  collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest costs,  the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say.  \"As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what  price we would like to get,\" said Wolak. \"It's not collusive. It's just  communicating price.\"  Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said  California's problem is not the result of trading.  \"It's a result of shortages,\" Palmer said.  Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in  downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors,  including expanded space for electricity trading.  Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims  to be the most active computer-based trading market.  The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power  trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their  power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access  to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the  country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for a  national electricity grid.  Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is  traded is mistaken.  \"The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity,\" Palmer said.  Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a different  function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of  demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about  how high to set their price.  \"The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices,\" said Dunn.  \"Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in  the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a  complimentary pattern.\"  The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days,  energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without  being undercut by competitors.  This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test  of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing.  But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in  court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of  antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the  California economy.  To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at  Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of  what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies  created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among  themselves, driving up prices in the process.  Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's  administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and  tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tendency  to create markets that work only for insiders.  \"The broad goals of trading are the same,\" Trebing said.  \"The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices.\" ","recipient_ids":[29416,4001,28554,34034],"sender_id":52092,"datetime":991787220,"message_id":234551,"subject":"Fwd: IS TRADING AN INSIDER'S GAME?"}

When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to  budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that it  charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity  that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.  Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove,  who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies to  collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest costs,  the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say.  \"As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what  price we would like to get,\" said Wolak. \"It's not collusive. It's just  communicating price.\"  Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said  California's problem is not the result of trading.  \"It's a result of shortages,\" Palmer said.  Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in  downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors,  including expanded space for electricity trading.  Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims  to be the most active computer-based trading market.  The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power  trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their  power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access  to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the  country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for a  national electricity grid.  Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is  traded is mistaken.  \"The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity,\" Palmer said.  Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a different  function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of  demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about  how high to set their price.  \"The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices,\" said Dunn.  \"Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in  the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a  complimentary pattern.\"  The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days,  energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without  being undercut by competitors.  This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test  of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing.  But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in  court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of  antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the  California economy.  To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at  Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of  what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies  created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among  themselves, driving up prices in the process.  Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's  administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and  tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tendency  to create markets that work only for insiders.  \"The broad goals of trading are the same,\" Trebing said.  \"The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices.\" ","recipient_ids":[80635,49991],"sender_id":52092,"datetime":991787640,"message_id":234552,"subject":"Fwd: IS TRADING AN INSIDER'S GAME?"}

{"body":"The prehearing conference in the CA case was an interesting proceeding.  It became very apparent that the ISO was primarily responsible for the delay in producing data.  The parties complained that they had not received what the ISO had promised.  The PX complained that they had received NO reliable data from ISO (it was riddled with errors) and that they were at the same point as at the beginning of the entire proceeding.  The PX needs the ISO data in order to commence generating the data that the PX itself needs to produce.  In any event, the new, delayed schedule is a positive development.  It is noteworthy that we were able to group consideration of refunds issues and offsets to refunds on the same date- October 26 (previously refund testimony was considered first, and testimony related to possible offsets to refunds was considered on a subsequent date).  This is very positive since it reduces the chance that the proceeding will be only about refunds and that the offsets issue will be marginalized.

However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us.  Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a.    At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables.  As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty.  I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers.  The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business.  These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding.  Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.  I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.  It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding.  Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.","recipient_ids":[14696],"sender_id":1174,"datetime":998576782,"message_id":235559,"subject":"FW: California Refund Proceeding Privileged and Confidential Attorney Work Product Attorney-Client Communication"}

I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we file.      Here's why:                       - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule                         on market-based rate eligibility.                     - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very                        high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up                     reasons.  I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we                      know they don't care about.  I think the real reason                      is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the                      new rule comes out.                       - -  No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable                      to get kicked out, too.  They might not want to give                      MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new                      rule.                      - -    The best way to deal with that is to sit down with                       staff, go over the draft page by page, and see                      what more they want.  But that would take too long,                      because of staff's schedule.                      - -   The second best way is for me to call Dan                      Larcamp or Mike Coleman, at FERC; tell them that                      we're not in a huge hurry, but we really don't want a                     deficiency letter; read him the language in the draft                     about how we'll comply with the new rule, and see if                      that's good enough.  If he suggests different                      language, we'll have to put it in there.                      - - Alternatively, if we really want to try to slide this                      through without saying anything to FERC in                      advance, we can file it, and just hope that the                      language we have about complying with the new                      rule  is good enough.   But that's really not what I                      would recommend.            If we do decide to call FERC, I could call right away, and probably get an answer in time to file today.  If not, then certainly tomorrow. Otherwise, we're pretty much ready.                2.  I really do think that we could ask for 30 days without raising any eyebrows.

We are aware that Enron received 203 authorization to sell that entity earlier this year.  We am uncertain about whether that transaction closed but we assumed it did and removed it but need to confirm with you that it is appropriate to remove it.    Thank you for the suggestion about updating the information from the triennial filing.  We will certainly double check to make sure the companies we have listed in the attached draft have not been sold. Also, we refer to exhibit 2 to the triennial filing made on January 14, 2000 rather than listing the names of Enron's generating units with market-based rate authorization whose output is dedicated under long-term contracts.  We will confirm that this information is still accurate as well.    Thanks again,  Cathy   Catherine P.

{"body":"The exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises  significant novel legal risks for Enron.  As most of you will by now know,  probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has  confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that  information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity.  This could well  result in legal proceeding against Enron.  In practice, an allegation of  misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend  without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information.  In  fact,  Enron's credit trading will, as you know, rely strictly on publicly  available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential  information, unless the reference entity has specifically consented.   Nevertheless, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, we are taking  additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with  potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote  prices on such entities.  Against this background is the ever-present risk of \"insider dealing\".  This  crime - which in the UK carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an  unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc)  deals in the securities (shares, bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed  company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive  information.  We do not expect at this time to deal in publicly traded bonds  as part of EnronCredit.com, but insider dealing is relevant to the conduct of  Enron staff and could affect other parts of our business.

Gray Davis conceded Wednesday that the state will be in=20 trouble without more contracts, but insisted California will meet its needs=20 through conservation and additional long-term deals for cheap electricity.=20 The state, according to a report released Wednesday, has fallen far short of=20 the governor's goal of filling almost all its electricity needs through such=20 deals. In fact, the state has lined up contracts for about half the amount=20 Davis had projected earlier this month.=20 If the state has to rely heavily on the volatile spot market, where the price=20 of electricity this summer could reach five times the state's contract price,=20 pressure could mount to raise the cap on the electricity rates consumers pay.=20 But Steven Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said, ``The governor has said=20 he's committed to work this in the existing rate structure, so that's the=20 plan.''=20 In the report sent to state lawmakers, the state Department of Water=20 Resources indicated that it had secured just more than 20 million=20 megawatt-hours for this year, leaving it far short of the 60 million=20 megawatt-hours needed.=20 ``This is just a progress report,'' Maviglio said. ``They did all this in=20 three weeks, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, and we have a=20 lot more to do.''=20 The state got into the power buying business in January, supplying it to the=20 state's nearly bankrupt utilities.=20 The state negotiated long-term contracts with generators to supply that power=20 at a reduced rate. Based on the report, the state will pay an average of $68=20 per megawatt-hour over the next 10 years -- significantly less than in=20 December when prices spiked higher than $300 per megawatt-hour but not as low=20 as the $55 Davis hoped to reach.=20 Most of this power, however, won't be delivered until 2004. From 2004 to=20 2006, the Department of Water Resources estimates, it has enough power under=20 contract. Until then, the amount falls short.=20 In 2001, it appears the state has about one-third of the power it needs. The=20 gap closes to about half in 2002 and two-thirds in 2003.=20 At a news conference in Los Angeles two weeks ago, Davis said the state would=20 have to buy only 30 to 45 percent of the power it needs this summer on the=20 open market.=20 At the time, critics said with only two-thirds of the power under contract, a=20 rate increase was almost inevitable. Even Davis' chief negotiator, S. David=20 Freeman, offered a bleak assessment for the summer, saying that all available=20 electricity has already been sold.=20 ``We'll be subject to extremely high prices,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford=20 professor who sits on a market committee for the Independent System Operator,=20 the agency that runs the state power grid.=20 Wolak said there are two main hopes for avoiding a price increase this=20 summer: Federal officials could cap the wholesale price, a step they've=20 resisted, or Californians can conserve an unprecedented amount of power. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- Crisis saps state surplus POWER CRISIS=20 Controller moves to block a transfer of funds, saying the $8.5 billion=20 surplus has been cut more than half since January=20 By Mike Taugher TIMES STAFF WRITER=20 The energy crisis has bled California's once-touted budget surplus by more=20 than half since taxpayers began buying electricity two months ago, leading a=20 top state finance official Wednesday to order an audit of the power purchases=20 and block Gov. Gray Davis' plan to transfer funds into a reserve account.=20 A booming economy last year produced a budget surplus that totaled $8.5=20 billion in January. But that figure now stands at about $3.2 billion,=20 according to Controller Kathleen Connell.=20 \"We started this year with a generous budget surplus,\" Connell said in a=20 statement announcing her decision to block what Davis administration=20 officials described as a routine transfer of surplus money. \"The energy=20 crisis has taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the=20 electricity purchases would put the fund at risk.\"=20 Meanwhile, the Davis administration released a report by David Freeman, the=20 governor's chief negotiator on power purchases, on the progress of executing=20 long-term agreements meant to stabilize the power buys.=20 According to the report, only about 40 percent of the electricity needed from=20 the open market this year has been lined up. That means the state could be=20 forced to continue buying a substantial amount of power on the highly=20 expensive spot market and further drain its coffers.=20 And a key regulatory panel is scheduled next week to issue a ruling that=20 would determine how quickly state funds will be replenished when it decides=20 what portion of electric bill payments should be allocated to the state=20 treasury, a decision that could include a rate increase to fully repay=20 taxpayers without further crippling the state's two largest electric=20 utilities.=20 The Public Utilities Commission also will consider whether it will force the=20 utilities to pay alternative energy producers, whose shutdowns this week=20 contributed to blackouts.=20 Connell's action underscores a growing nervousness over the sheer volume of=20 money that is being poured into energy buys, despite the fact that state=20 officials plan to replenish the treasury with up to $10 billion in loans that=20 will be repaid by electricity consumers.=20 The state has committed to spending $4.2 billion to date to keep lights on=20 since taxpayers were forced in mid-January to take over electricity buys from=20 the financially crippled utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern=20 California Edison. Tax money is going out at a clip of about $50 million a=20 day.=20 High prices already have brought PG&E and Edison to the brink of bankruptcy,=20 and now the state's surplus is at risk, according to Connell.=20 In addition to requesting an audit and announcing her intention to delay the=20 transfer to the reserve account, Connell said she wanted the administration=20 to send her office more information about the electricity purchases.=20 Davis' representatives questioned Connell's authority in trying to block the=20 funds transfer, which they called a routine accounting procedure, and accused=20 her of making political hay.=20 \"It is not helpful to the taxpayers or ratepayers or the people who just want=20 to keep the lights on, it isn't helpful to have the situation muddied like=20 this,\" said Sandy Harrison, a Finance Department spokesperson. \"We're sorry=20 it came up in this manner.\"=20 Connell and the administration have butted heads in recent weeks. The=20 controller wants to post details of the state's electricity purchases on her=20 Web site, a plan that have been delayed under pressure from Davis because of=20 the governor's concerns that releasing those details will allow power=20 generators and traders to sell at higher prices.=20 Harrison said administration officials believe Connell lacks the authority=20 either to block the funds transfer to a reserve account or to audit the state=20 water resources department.=20 Two days of widespread blackouts this week show how vulnerable the power grid=20 is to financial glitches. Although several factors combined to produce the=20 blackouts, state power officials say the outages could have been avoided if=20 the utilities were paying their bills to alternative energy producers.=20 Many of those producers, including clean-burning natural gas power plants,=20 wind, solar and geothermal energy developers, shut down enough production to=20 spell the difference between grid reliability and blackouts Monday and=20 Tuesday.=20 Davis called the utilities' failure to pay bills to those producers, known as=20 qualifying facilities, \"immoral.\" The QFs were either unable to buy gas from=20 their suppliers or were frustrated with the utilities' failure to pay them.=20 \"The utilities hoarded billions of dollars since November without paying any=20 money out,\" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. \"They've got the money --=20 we're pulling the trigger to make them pay it.\"=20 The utilities, however, say they are doing all they can to conserve enough=20 cash to continue operating. Together, they owe the QFs about $1.5 billion.=20 Next week, the PUC is scheduled to consider whether to force the utilities to=20 heed Davis' demand to pay the QFs, and it might also decide how much of=20 ratepayers' bill payments will be used to refund taxpayers for power buys.=20 PG&E says that under a formula proposed by the administration, the water=20 resources department would receive about 40 percent of the money collected=20 from ratepayers for power purchases.=20 The rest of that money, about $240 million, would have to be divided among=20 QFs, existing power contracts, operating PG&E's nuclear and hydroelectric=20 plants, and what hour-by-hour purchases the utility still must make on the=20 spot market, according to PG&E spokesman John Nelson.=20 \"There isn't enough to do that,\" he said.=20 That is making it increasingly likely that electric bills will be hiked,=20 according to a growing chorus of officials and experts.=20 Unless rates are raised, Nelson said, the only entity that can absorb a lack=20 of payment or a partial payment is the state treasury. Cutting off any others=20 will lead to electricity becoming unavailable and more blackouts, he said.=20 \"If they do it under existing rates -- given that the existing pool of money=20 is not enough -- who doesn't get paid or who gets a partial payment?\" Nelson=20 said. \"What's the only entity left with wiggle room? The state.\"=20 Rate hikes are also a sticking point in negotiations to bail out the=20 utilities through purchase of their transmission lines and other assets,=20 Maviglio said.=20 \"They want rate increases of significant magnitude, and we're not going=20 there,\" he said.=20 WE CAN TRIM STORY HERE IF NECESSARY, BUT KEEP TAGLINES AT BOTTOM=20 About one-third the electricity needed by the customers of California's three=20 major utility companies is produced by the companies themselves, one-third=20 comes from alternative producers who use environmentally friendly techniques=20 and one-third is bought on the open market.=20 The state stepped in to buy the one-third needed from the open market after=20 the utility companies ran out of cash and credit in January to make the=20 purchases themselves.=20 But that electricity has proven to be enormously expensive, and Davis has=20 planned to lower those prices by committing to long-term purchases.=20 Freeman's report on the progress of those long-term purchases, dated March 15=20 but released this week, said the state has finalized 19 contracts with seven=20 suppliers and reached 25 additional agreements.=20 Mike Taugher covers the environment and energy.

Joe Barton,=20 chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and air quality=20 subcommittee.=20 Some form of federal controls to hold down escalating wholesale prices this=20 summer because of power shortages has been the most frequent appeal of=20 witnesses who testified before the panel during roughly 30 hours of hearings=20 over five days.=20 Such controls have been sought by the governors of California, Oregon and=20 Washington. As power shortages are forecast for other regions, states like=20 New York also have appealed for temporary price controls to halt gouging.=20 But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is responsible for=20 enforcing reasonable wholesale rates under the Federal Power Act, has refused=20 to impose them, and the Bush administration is bolstering that decision by=20 opposing any legislation that would compel such action.=20 Barton, in a brief hallway interview, declined to say what other legislative=20 remedies he might propose to address the worsening California situation.=20 He said he expects to submit a list of ideas to the White House today, and=20 after receiving comment on it, sit down with other committee Republicans and=20 Democrats next week to see if any legislation is in order.=20 \"If we are going to do anything to help California or the West this summer,=20 we have to make it law within the next month or six weeks,\" Barton said.=20 Even the panel's senior Democrat, Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, was urging a=20 \"careful and deliberate approach\" to the California crisis, which he said was=20 largely of the state's own making.=20 There are steps Congress might take to provide some help to the West, such as=20 more money for conservation and relaxed federal regulation of air quality=20 standards. That would permit older, more polluting generators to operate=20 through a long, hot summer when electricity demand could exceed supply by=20 about 3,000 megawatts, roughly the amount needed to power 3 million homes.=20 But Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said power=20 production already is being maximized without sacrificing air quality.=20 \"Simply put, no essential electricity generation has been curtailed due to=20 air emission limitations,\" he said. \"California's programs to protect public=20 health are not major factors in the electricity shortages experienced to=20 date.\"=20 The concern is that as shortages turn into more rolling blackouts, wholesale=20 prices will jump even higher and steadily bleed the economies of California=20 and the West Coast.=20 William L.

Gray Davis to handle=20 the crisis on his own, suddenly came to life Thursday, jolted by this week's=20 unexpected rolling blackouts and threats by creditors to force the utilities=20 into bankruptcy court. Lawmakers quickly fashioned a basketful of legislation=20 aimed -- or so they hope -- at increasing power supplies, promoting=20 conservation and relieving the financial pressure on utilities and=20 electricity generators. But it may be too little, too late -- and Davis and=20 other politicians are already pointing fingers of blame, aware that a=20 political price will be paid if the apocalypse strikes.=20 While Davis chants his mantra that he inherited a fatally flawed utility=20 deregulation scheme from predecessor Pete Wilson, Republicans are blaming=20 Davis for moving too slowly after the crisis first surfaced last summer, and=20 even some of Davis' fellow Democrats are distancing themselves from the=20 governor.=20 \"Deregulation was a product of a Republican governor, a Republican author and=20 a Republican PUC (Public Utilities Commission) that was unduly impatient,\"=20 Davis said at one point this week as the Capitol buzzed with private=20 negotiations and public posturing.=20 A day later, however, state Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, issued a=20 warning that Davis' power purchases, running at $50 million a day, had=20 already drawn down state budget reserves by nearly two-thirds, and she=20 refused to authorize additional transfers. It was a direct shot by Connell at=20 Davis, an old rival, and came just a day after the governor had endorsed a=20 Connell foe, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the duel for mayor of Los Angeles.=20 Other Democrats didn't join Connell's direct challenge to Davis, but there=20 is, nevertheless, a growing concern among Democratic legislators that the=20 power purchases are costing many billions of dollars more than the governor=20 had projected and could place the state budget in jeopardy. They're nervous=20 because Davis has refused to reveal, even to legislators, exactly how much=20 power the state is buying each day and how much it is paying.=20 From the few details that have been disclosed, it's clear that the state is=20 spending about $1.5 billion a month, which would wipe out the state's=20 reserves by midsummer. It's also becoming increasingly clear that Davis=20 probably can't make good on his promise to avoid major consumer rate=20 increases, unless the state is willing to plunge deeply and semi-permanently=20 into debt to underwrite wholesale costs, or unless federal authorities order=20 huge refunds from power suppliers.=20 Rates in areas served by private utilities have risen only slightly while the=20 costs, first to utilities and later to the state, soared.

Suppliers deny the=20 accusation.=20  By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers=20  ?????Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about $5.5=20 billion between May and last month, and that money should be refunded to the=20 state's taxpayers and financially strapped utilities, the state power grid=20 operator said Wednesday. ?????Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of=20 bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market, the California=20 Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data. The findings=20 support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional=20 revenue by manipulating the market. ?????Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation. ?????The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is=20 central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers=20 excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis. ?????\"This might be the first time we told them the total impact and=20 magnitude [of the overcharging],\" said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director of=20 market analysis. \"We think the entire amount deserves consideration for=20 refunds.\" ?????Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity=20 sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of=20 the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities=20 engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices: ?????* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices,=20 even though they could have made some money selling more electricity. ?????* Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid=20 at all. ?????The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their=20 electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average=20 markup in August was 100% during peak hours. ?????A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which=20 oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country, declined to=20 comment Wednesday, saying, \"This is part of an ongoing proceeding.\" ?????FERC member William L. Massey, who has considered previous commission=20 actions on refunds to be inadequate, said it would be improper for him to=20 comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the=20 $5.5-billion total, Massey said: \"That doesn't shock me in any way.\" ?????\"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the=20 federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have=20 exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,\" he said. ?????Cal-ISO, which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market,=20 previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and=20 January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds=20 of only a tiny fraction of that amount. ?????The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy,=20 Dynegy, Williams\/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, formerly Southern Energy--plus=20 16 power importers, all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas &=20 Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. ?????\"All [21] overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate=20 amounts,\" Sheffrin said. ?????Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each=20 company, but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code will=20 be provided to FERC, Sheffrin said, and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how=20 much information about the companies will be made public.  ?????State, U.S. Investigations ?????California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power=20 in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and=20 federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in=20 May. ?????Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California=20 market in any way, whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or=20 through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices. ?????Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and is=20 confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were=20 justified, said Joe Bob Perkins, president of the Houston-based company. ?????Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units=20 so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants.=20 These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in the=20 state. ?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typically=20 don't include such fixed costs as salaries, taxes and the interest on bonds=20 they sold to finance their power plants, which they acquired under terms of=20 the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law. ?????In addition, he said, many high-priced power days have resulted from=20 buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers=20 charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the=20 listing price in a hot real estate market. ?????Williams Energy Services, a trading company that markets most of the=20 power produced by plants owned by AES, also says it will be exonerated by=20 FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted, said Paula=20 Hill-Collins, spokeswoman for the Tulsa, Okla., company. ?????\"FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are=20 made,\" Hill-Collins said. \"This is just a process of justification, not=20 necessarily proof of guilt.\" ?????Williams\/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take=20 generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices, or=20 refund $10.8 million to California utilities. ?????During the period studied, suppliers sold electricity in the California=20 Power Exchange to Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &=20 Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by=20 Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt, and=20 most suppliers stopped selling to them in January, forcing the state=20 Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for=20 the three big utilities' 27 million customers. ?????The Cal-ISO study, first summarized at an energy conference last week at=20 UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized, concluded that the companies=20 exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices. ?????Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley, said=20 Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices=20 in 2000. ?????\"We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive=20 pricing,\" he said. \"When the market was tight this summer, they were able to=20 push up prices, and they did.\" ?????The early warning signs of electricity price spikes, the study found,=20 appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 per=20 megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer, dipped in=20 September and October with lower demand, then took off in November and=20 December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas, which is used=20 to generate much of the state's electricity, reached record levels. ?????\"There were plant outages, and demand and supply became close,\" Sheffrin=20 said. \"Whatever price they bid had to be taken, and market power asserted=20 itself.\" ?????Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred=20 between May and November. ?????On Friday, federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to=20 refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in=20 February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430=20 per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts, when supplies are so tight=20 that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough=20 electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.) ?????The previous week, FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69=20 million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour. ?????Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were=20 limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and because=20 the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt more=20 than 70,000 transactions from scrutiny. ?????\"We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost, which is=20 Stage 3 alerts,\" said Massey, one of three commissioners on the five-member=20 board (two seats are vacant). ?????Generators \"have been given the free and clear,\" he said. ?????\"These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are=20 almost a joke,\" said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, senior attorney at the=20 Utility Reform Network.  ?????Resisting Price Caps ?????Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators can=20 no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what=20 the market will bear. ?????\"FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers'=20 own showing that they could not manipulate prices, yet their actions have=20 shown the contrary,\" Sheffrin said. \"We feel FERC needs to look at the=20 premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at market-based=20 rates.\" ?????The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable=20 electricity rates. Although it has called California's power market=20 dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation, the agency has resisted setting=20 firm price caps sought by California's congressional delegation. ?????Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr. strongly opposes caps, while Massey wants to=20 use caps across the West as a \"temporary timeout.\" ?????Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, in a New York news conference=20 Wednesday, reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to=20 cope with California's energy crisis. ?????\"If we put price caps in place, there will be more blackouts, and=20 they'll be worse,\" Abraham said. ?????Cal-ISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff=20 recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation. FERC's proposal=20 includes strict coordination of power plant outages by Cal-ISO with reporting=20 of suspicious closures to FERC, and generator-by-generator bid caps tied to=20 costs. ---=20 ?????Reiterman reported from San Francisco, Rivera Brooks from Los Angeles.=20 Times staff writer Thomas S.

Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the=20 statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency. ?????But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained shut=20 down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them. ?????State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high=20 cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will=20 block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an=20 account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity. ?????And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis=20 and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts=20 for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to=20 7,000 megawatts previously claimed. ?????While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report=20 notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons,=20 including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by=20 July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, but=20 none have yet been issued. ?????\"We are exposed enormously this summer,\" Senate Energy Committee=20 chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report.=20 \"We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be.=20 We don't have a power fairy.\" ?????Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall=20 significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the=20 state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many=20 times those of long-term contracts. ?????After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist=20 who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested=20 that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the=20 state will need this summer. ?????\"We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of=20 2003,\" he said. ?????California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost=20 of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed=20 billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the=20 spot market. ?????Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with=20 generators, said the report represents a \"work in progress.\" He said the=20 state may yet sign new contracts. ?????However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have=20 been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless=20 serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately. ?????Wolak and other ex","recipient_ids":[5074,3475,65279,65373,2157,48355,1489,11447,5128,253,1474,3161,4132,2238,1180,166,15283,1547,5416,3535,17095,2383,47920,28654,3495,181,4851,5894,817,1570,8546,2280,9060,1490,801,17182,17579,10758,8436,2326,18009,2160,1480,818,2219,803],"sender_id":4967,"datetime":985223040,"message_id":253127,"subject":"Energy Issues"}

Unofficially,=20 he's Bill Jones, 2002 gubernatorial candidate.=20 The evidence is right there between the lines -- in the subtleties of his=20 speeches, their subject matter, and the way Jones carries himself when he's=20 in public.=20 Monday was no different, as Jones addressed a Rotary Club luncheon in Fresno=20 full of people who are assuming -- though nothing is official -- that the=20 Fresno native will soon announce his intention to challenge Gov. Davis next=20 year.=20 \"Bill, they call me governor,\" Chas Looney, a former Rotary Club district=20 governor, quipped to Jones. \"I look forward to the day we all can call you=20 governor.\"=20 Jones then proceeded to deliver a speech to a packed house in the DoubleTree=20 Hotel that touched on his accomplishments as secretary of state, but quickly=20 moved to his main topic: California's crumbling infrastructure and how the=20 energy crisis is affecting the state.=20 Always in the background but never mentioned by name was Davis. Jones was=20 careful to hew to the Rotary rule that speeches steer clear of partisan=20 politics.=20 Still, Jones looked, sounded and acted like a candidate for governor, and=20 near the end of his speech he promised his decision would come soon.=20 The Fresno Republican's speech began by highlighting his work in passing the=20 \"Three Strikes and You're Out\" initiative in 1994.=20 Jones also talked of his efforts to remove 2 million inactive California=20 voters from the rolls.=20 But it was clearly the energy crisis and its ramifications -- an issue=20 Republicans feel they can pin on Davis and the Democratic-controlled=20 Legislature -- that was the centerpiece of the speech.=20 Today, the energy crisis is being driven, he said, by a lack of power plant=20 construction. And while billions go to solve the crisis, he said, the state=20 faces $100 billion in unmet infrastructure needs -- everything from school=20 repair to road repair.=20 \"Doesn't that scare you?\" Jones asked.=20 He then recounted the warning signs -- ignored by the state, he said -- of=20 the looming energy crisis.=20 He cited the initial warnings that the deregulation bill was flawed, last=20 summer's request by Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to allow forward=20 contracting and the Republican request for a special session to deal with the=20 energy crisis. All ignored, Jones said.=20 Now, Edison and PG&E are near bankruptcy and the state finds itself stepping=20 up as a creditor. \"And the solution now becomes California getting into the=20 energy business,\" he said. \"Or, even carrying it to a greater degree, not=20 just in the short term to buy power to keep the lights on.

Gray Davis said the=20 Public Utilities Commission and the Legislature would move promptly to order=20 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to start paying=20 those small energy producers for their electricity. Davis said the two=20 utilities will face \"considerable fines\" if they don't pay up.=20 But several of the producers, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" said they=20 doubted Davis' plan would go far enough to get them back in operation. And it=20 wasn't clear whether the plan would keep the increasingly impatient=20 alternative producers from hauling one or both of the big utilities into=20 bankruptcy court, as some have threatened.=20 The shortage of power from the qualifying facilities -- plus a near-record=20 heat wave (downtown Sacramento topped off at 83 degrees, one degree short of=20 the 84 degree record set in 1960), a lack of hydropower and other problems --=20 prompted the state's Independent System Operator to order a second day of=20 blackouts starting mid-morning. But the blackouts hit only about half as many=20 Californians as Monday's, with late afternoon conservation efforts helping=20 balance supply with demand.=20 The blackouts, usually about an hour long, hit about 7,600 Sacramento=20 Municipal Utility District customers in Elk Grove and south Sacramento=20 County. PG&E customers in suburban counties were affected as well.=20 The order darkened shops in San Francisco's Chinatown and was blamed for a=20 crash that left two motorists seriously injured in the Los Angeles suburb of=20 South El Monte. A Sun Microsystems Inc. factory in Newark had to close for=20 several hours.=20 Most Californians took the blackouts in stride, though. Elk Grove High School=20 students filed outside to play hacky sack. Coffee shop patrons in Davis=20 milled outdoors, enjoying the unseasonably warm weather.=20 Yet the blackout order was met with outright defiance by one municipal=20 utility. The city of Lodi refused to cut power to its residents Monday or=20 Tuesday, saying it shouldn't have to suffer because of the financial crisis=20 afflicting PG&E and Edison.=20 The outlook for today and the near future was brighter, as several big power=20 plants came back on line after repairs. ISO officials also praised=20 Californians' conservation efforts, which had faltered in the morning but=20 came on strong in the afternoon, helping to prevent further blackouts. By=20 evening the grid was in a relatively mild Stage 2 power alert.=20 But the second day of blackouts -- plus an increasing threat of utility=20 bankruptcy -- pushed Davis to the brink. The governor cobbled together a=20 payment plan to rescue the qualifying facilities -- some 600 wind farms,=20 geothermal plants and other alternative-energy generators whose production=20 has become increasingly vital in recent days.=20 Under Davis' plan, the Legislature and the PUC would order PG&E and Edison to=20 pay the qualifying facilities for power delivered after April 1. The=20 utilities are required to buy power from the qualifying facilities under a=20 1978 federal law designed to bring cheaper and cleaner forms of electricity=20 to market.=20 Davis said the PUC would release a proposed order late Tuesday that would=20 require the utilities to pay the qualifying facilities $79 a megawatt hour=20 for five-year contracts or $69 for 10-year contracts. The Legislature also=20 would have to pass a law authorizing the PUC to issue such an order.=20 But the situation was far from resolved late Tuesday, and PG&E and Edison=20 were likely to oppose at least portions of Davis' plan.=20 Edison is willing only to make \"some kind of partial payments going forward,\"=20 said Thomas Higgins, a senior vice president with parent company Edison=20 International. \"We have a limited amount of resources available to us in=20 rates, ... and that's the constraining factor.\"=20 PG&E, which has been making partial payments to the qualifying facilities,=20 said it could pay them in advance, in full, for future power deliveries.=20 But PG&E said such payments would eat up half the $400 million it has=20 available each month to buy power -- and unless it gets a rate hike, there=20 wouldn't be enough to pay the qualifying facilities and cover other expenses,=20 including the cost of reimbursing the state Department of Water Resources for=20 the power the agency is buying on behalf of the troubled utility.=20 PG&E's proposal could represent a challenge of sorts to state officials:=20 Accept less money for the water department, or raise rates.=20 State officials \"need to resolve who they want to see paid,\" PG&E spokesman=20 John Nelson said. \"There is a limited pool of money.\"=20 For his part, Davis insisted that the water department would be first in line=20 to be paid, and he said the PUC will issue a proposed order to that effect.=20 \"We are getting paid before anybody else,\" Davis said.=20 Hundreds of qualifying facilities are out of commission because PG&E and=20 Edison haven't paid them. The situation has robbed the state of several=20 thousand badly needed megawatts and is a key reason blackouts have been=20 ordered. In normal times the facilities produce more than 20 percent of=20 California's electricity.=20 Some of the qualifying facilities have been threatening to haul one or both=20 of California's beleaguered utilities into bankruptcy court unless they get=20 paid soon, saying a bankruptcy filing might be the only way they can save=20 their businesses.=20 \"You've got to take care of the QF problem or the whole thing blacks out,\"=20 said Jerry Bloom, a lawyer representing one group of qualifying facilities.=20 \"(State officials) are starting to understand.\"=20 One thing that was fairly certain about Davis' still-sketchy payment plan: It=20 wouldn't cover PG&E and Edison's existing debt to the qualifying facilities,=20 estimated at more than $1.48 billion.=20 In their current financial state, the utilities say they can't afford to pay=20 the existing debt. In addition, paying the debt would create a major=20 complication: Other creditors, including the big power generators, would=20 surely haul Edison and PG&E into bankruptcy court on the grounds that they=20 weren't being treated fairly.=20 \"You can't give preferential payment treatment to one class of creditors over=20 another,\" PG&E's Nelson said. \"You virtually assure that (the other=20 creditors) have to file an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against you.\"=20 But without full payment, it wasn't clear how many of the qualifying=20 facilities would be able to restart.=20 Executives at several plants -- the ones that run on natural gas -- said=20 they're not sure their gas suppliers will deliver unless the existing debts=20 are cleared up.=20 \"We need to convince a gas company to supply us,\" said Ed Tomeo of UAE Energy=20 Operations Corp., which had to shut off its 40-megawatt Kern County plant=20 Tuesday. \"We're a company that already owes millions of dollars for gas=20 supplies.

The DWP, like Southern California Edison, was=20 affected by an outage at the huge Mohave power plant in Nevada, as well as by=20 planned outages at several of its facilities. ?????As in the past, by far the biggest impact was felt by customers served=20 by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which cut power to=20 438,000 homes and businesses. ?????Edison cut power to 47,462 customers in about 40 cities, but eventually=20 was able to avoid blackouts by shutting off the air conditioners of some of=20 the 118,500 customers who participate in a voluntary cutoff program. ?????San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to 73,400 customers.  ?????Innovative Ways of Coping ?????As on Monday, most people took the outages in stride, as an annoying but=20 ultimately unavoidable inconvenience. ?????In Palmdale, four schools lost power during one of the hourlong=20 blackouts, but teachers and students pressed on in the sunlight pouring=20 through windows and skylights. At Barrel Springs Elementary, Principal Cruz=20 Earls said the biggest problem came when students had to go to the bathroom:=20 Hand in hand, they made their way through darkened hallways with flashlights. ?????All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. Then again, the weather=20 wasn't that hot Tuesday, with a high of 79 in Palmdale, so the shutdown of=20 air conditioners wasn't much of a hardship. \"I don't want to think about the=20 conditions this could create in May or June,\" Earls said. ?????Businesses of all kinds complained about the lack of warning for the=20 outages--and sometimes found innovative ways to get around the problem. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, El Burrito=20 Mexican Food Products in the city of Industry started its Tuesday shift at 2=20 a.m. to beat the clock in the event of an outage. That hunch paid off.=20 Workers had just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa and=20 masa when the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????Company owner Mark Roth said the firm will continue working odd hours to=20 avoid further outages. But he isn't buying the line from the utilities that=20 they can't provide advance warning because of concerns about looting and=20 rioting. ?????\"We're ready to do whatever it takes to get through this thing,\" he=20 said. \"But they've got to give us some notification.\" ?????At Big O Tires in Elk Grove, just south of Sacramento, owner Daniel Crum=20 had his 14 workers take an early lunch break or head to the warehouse to=20 reorganize the goods. Without electricity, they couldn't repair brakes or=20 align front ends. ?????\"I'd never let them be idle,\" said Crum. ?????At least two minor traffic accidents were blamed on the outages. ?????The blackouts resulted from a convergence of factors. ?????Demand was slightly higher than expected, probably because of=20 unseasonably warm weather. Supplies were tighter than usual, in part because=20 of several outages, including that at the Mohave plant, half of which was=20 brought back on line by the end of the day. ?????The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was still limping along=20 without power from one of its two 1,100-megawatt units, which was shut down=20 Feb. 3 after a half-hour fire in a nonnuclear part of the plant. Edison,=20 which operates San Onofre, initially estimated the unit would be out for=20 several weeks but recently said \"extensive damage\" to parts of the turbine=20 will keep the unit out of commission until mid-June. ?????Shipments from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, which generates=20 most of its electricity from large dams, were also down. ?????\"Each time we take a measurement, we're closer to the all-time record=20 for the driest year,\" said Dulcy Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power=20 Administration, the network of federal dams that provides the region with=20 much of its electricity. \"We've been doing what we can, but we simply don't=20 have power to sell.\" ?????Finally, there was the problem of the small and alternative energy=20 producers, which have shut down plants because they haven't been paid by the=20 private utilities since November. Those outages have cost the state about=20 3,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 2.3 million homes. ?????\"You're seeing the system freeze up,\" said David Sokol, chairman and CEO=20 of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which runs eight geothermal plants in the=20 Imperial Valley through its subsidiary, CalEnergy. His company hasn't shut=20 down yet, but Sokol said smaller companies couldn't continue to sell their=20 energy to utilities for free. ?????\"Why should we fund Edison?\" he asked. \"That's just ridiculous.\"  ?????A Choice of 2 Rate Plans ?????Davis joined lawmakers in the Capitol on Tuesday to outline his plan to=20 get the producers running again. He said utilities have had no right to=20 collect money from ratepayers and then not use the funds to repay the small=20 producers. The state has spent billions to buy power from large conventional=20 producers on behalf of the utilities but has refused to pick up the tab for=20 alternative energy. ?????\"The utilities acted in a shameful manner by putting money in their=20 pockets that was designed to pay the [small producers],\" Davis said. ?????The plan outlined by Davis would allow the generators to choose between=20 two rate plans. They could decide to be paid 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour over=20 five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ?????The utilities must begin paying the generators the new rates beginning=20 April 1 or face fines, Davis said. ?????The question of how the companies will get paid the about $1.5 billion=20 they are owed remains unresolved. That issue will be decided in coming weeks=20 as Davis' negotiators continue to work on rescue plans for the state's=20 financially hobbled private utilities. ?????PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the state's largest utility did not take=20 kindly to Davis' criticism, and noted that the governor's plan is similar to=20 a proposal that PG&E made last week to producers. ?????Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of a trade group that includes some=20 of the small generators, described the plan as a positive step. ?????\"The governor got it right in that it's not acceptable for small power=20 producers to continue to generate and not be paid,\" Smutny-Jones said. \"But=20 we'll need to see what the order says; the devil will truly be in the=20 details.\" ?????Grid operators said the state's overall energy situation eased by midday=20 Tuesday because of repairs at the Mohave plant and another large plant at=20 Ormond Beach, and because the Western Area Power Administration came up with=20 300 megawatts of electricity from Glen Canyon Dam. ?????Also, grid spokesman Patrick Dorinson said conservation savings spiked=20 upward after earlier complaints that Californians weren't conserving. ?????\"We saw the people of California probably conserve 900 megawatts today,\"=20 he said. \"That was probably the difference.\" ---=20 ?????Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Jose Cardenas, Marla Dickerson,=20 Noaki Schwartz, Nicholas Riccardi, Doug Smith, Rebecca Trounson and Richard=20 Winton in Los Angeles, Miguel Bustillo and Julie Tamaki in Sacramento, Maria=20 La Ganga in San Francisco, Stanley Allison, Matt Ebnet, Scott Martelle,=20 Dennis McLellan, Monte Morin, Jason Song, Mai Tran and Nancy Wride in Orange=20 County, and Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this story. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- Fragile Supply Network Apt to Fail=20  By JENIFER WARREN and ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writers=20  ?????A lot of people were caught off guard by the blackouts that swept over=20 California this week. Debra Bowen wasn't one of them. ?????As chairwoman of the state Senate Energy Committee, she is=20 intimately--and painfully--familiar with the state's energy supply. And she=20 is willing to share a secret: It's a fragile system, capable of collapse at=20 any time. ?????That knowledge keeps Bowen awake at night, particularly with the=20 approach of summer, when power demand surges as Californians get reacquainted=20 with their air conditioners. ?????\"I sound a bit less like Chicken Little today, don't I?\" Bowen said=20 Tuesday, as chunks of the state once again were forcibly darkened. \"I know a=20 lot of people don't feel we have a problem. But we have a very, very big=20 problem.\" ?????With the recent slowdown in Stage 3 emergencies, a sense of calm had=20 settled over the energy debate, and even some legislators were speaking with=20 guarded optimism about the hot months ahead. ?????On Tuesday, however, a creeping sense of doom was almost palpable among=20 energy watchers, and previous supply forecasts--which predict that the state=20 may yet escape summer blackouts--were being given a second look. ?????\"The outages of the last two days are something that Californians are=20 going to have to get used to for July and August,\" said Michael Zenker,=20 California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The=20 Massachusetts consulting firm is predicting about 20 hours of blackouts this=20 summer. ?????At the California Independent System Operator, which manages 75% of the=20 statewide power grid, officials said the energy cushion the state had in=20 recent weeks was, in some ways, a phantom caused by heavy imports of power. ?????Cal-ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said people may have been deluded=20 into a false state of comfort: \"Maybe there is a tendency to think things=20 have improved,\" he said. In fact, they haven't. ?????More than anything, this week's events illustrate the delicate balance=20 of factors that keep California illuminated, from the multitude of supply=20 sources to the weather. ?????Temperatures were higher than usual. Alternative-energy suppliers--who=20 haven't been paid in months by the cash-strapped utilities--cut their output.=20 Suppliers in the Northwest--which faces a drought--slashed exports. Equipment=20 breakdowns and maintenance at power plants--much of it unanticipated--took=20 13,000 megawatts offline. A utility-run program that gives businesses=20 discounts in exchange for cutting power during emergencies is all but dead. ?????\"The fragility of the system is such that a small perturbation can turn=20 everything upside down very easily,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director=20 of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group of electricity generators and=20 traders. ?????One factor receiving particular attention is the dip in supply caused by=20 unscheduled maintenance. To help officials predict available supply,=20 generators provide an annual maintenance plan that is updated regularly. ?????In addition, however, facilities sometimes shut down for unexpected=20 reasons: leaking tubes, burnt-out transformers, cracked turbines and faulty=20 feed pumps. At one point Tuesday, about 8,200 megawatts were unavailable=20 because of unscheduled shutdowns. That's enough to supply about 6 million=20 households, and up from 5,700 megawatts a week ago. ?????The huge 1,400-megawatt Mohave power plant near Laughlin, Nev., which=20 supplies Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water=20 and Power, was felled Monday by a transformer problem. That was enough to=20 push the state into blackouts. ?????A growing number of skeptics, however, question whether those reasons=20 are always valid, accusing generators of withholding power to shrink supply=20 and drive up prices. ?????\"There's no way to verify it, so you've got to take their word for it,\"=20 said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies California's=20 electricity market. \"And given that it's very profitable for these things to=20 occur, you start to wonder if they're creating an artificial scarcity.\" ?????Tom Williams of Duke Energy said the Houston-based company is working=20 hard to keep its California power plants, which are capable of producing=20 3,351 megawatts of electricity, in operation after months of near-continuous=20 operation. ?????\"It's like riding a moped across the country,\" he said. \"They're just=20 not meant to run this hard.\" ?????Last week, the state Senate formed a committee to investigate charges of=20 market manipulation by power suppliers. The chairman, state Sen. Joe Dunn=20 (D-Santa Ana), says the issue of unscheduled plant shutdowns is on his agenda. ?????\"The problem is: How does one prove that a particular outage was part of=20 a deliberate strategy to deprive the state of kilowatts, rather than a result=20 of normal business operations?\" Dunn said. ---=20 ?????Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this story. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- Elevator Anxiety Is Riding High=20  Emergencies: Workers in skyscrapers worry about blackouts trapping them in=20 their buildings.

Unofficially,=20 he's Bill Jones, 2002 gubernatorial candidate.=20 The evidence is right there between the lines -- in the subtleties of his=20 speeches, their subject matter, and the way Jones carries himself when he's=20 in public.=20 Monday was no different, as Jones addressed a Rotary Club luncheon in Fresno=20 full of people who are assuming -- though nothing is official -- that the=20 Fresno native will soon announce his intention to challenge Gov. Davis next=20 year.=20 \"Bill, they call me governor,\" Chas Looney, a former Rotary Club district=20 governor, quipped to Jones. \"I look forward to the day we all can call you=20 governor.\"=20 Jones then proceeded to deliver a speech to a packed house in the DoubleTree=20 Hotel that touched on his accomplishments as secretary of state, but quickly=20 moved to his main topic: California's crumbling infrastructure and how the=20 energy crisis is affecting the state.=20 Always in the background but never mentioned by name was Davis. Jones was=20 careful to hew to the Rotary rule that speeches steer clear of partisan=20 politics.=20 Still, Jones looked, sounded and acted like a candidate for governor, and=20 near the end of his speech he promised his decision would come soon.=20 The Fresno Republican's speech began by highlighting his work in passing the=20 \"Three Strikes and You're Out\" initiative in 1994.=20 Jones also talked of his efforts to remove 2 million inactive California=20 voters from the rolls.=20 But it was clearly the energy crisis and its ramifications -- an issue=20 Republicans feel they can pin on Davis and the Democratic-controlled=20 Legislature -- that was the centerpiece of the speech.=20 Today, the energy crisis is being driven, he said, by a lack of power plant=20 construction. And while billions go to solve the crisis, he said, the state=20 faces $100 billion in unmet infrastructure needs -- everything from school=20 repair to road repair.=20 \"Doesn't that scare you?\" Jones asked.=20 He then recounted the warning signs -- ignored by the state, he said -- of=20 the looming energy crisis.=20 He cited the initial warnings that the deregulation bill was flawed, last=20 summer's request by Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to allow forward=20 contracting and the Republican request for a special session to deal with the=20 energy crisis. All ignored, Jones said.=20 Now, Edison and PG&E are near bankruptcy and the state finds itself stepping=20 up as a creditor. \"And the solution now becomes California getting into the=20 energy business,\" he said. \"Or, even carrying it to a greater degree, not=20 just in the short term to buy power to keep the lights on. I'm talking about=20 basically socializing the energy business.\"=20 Jones said he prefers low-interest loans to Edison and PG&E, taking the=20 electric grid as collateral.=20 \"I just do not believe in California getting into something it does not know=20 how to do -- has never done before -- on top of all of our other=20 obligations,\" he said.=20 \"It really worries me that California will not be able to endure that type of=20 obligation.\"=20 Jones said polls now show increasing numbers of residents saying the state is=20 headed in the wrong direction.=20 \"I feel obligated to speak out and say there is a better way,\" Jones said. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Day 2 -- Battling blackouts: Payment plan sought to restart small plants By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writers (Published March 21, 2001)=20 Blackouts rolled across California for a second straight day Tuesday,=20 snarling traffic, darkening businesses and sending state officials scrambling=20 to craft a payment plan to revive the wind farms and other critically needed=20 small energy producers that have shut down because of financial woes.=20 On a day when another 570,000 customers lost power, Gov. Gray Davis said the=20 Public Utilities Commission and the Legislature would move promptly to order=20 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to start paying=20 those small energy producers for their electricity. Davis said the two=20 utilities will face \"considerable fines\" if they don't pay up.=20 But several of the producers, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" said they=20 doubted Davis' plan would go far enough to get them back in operation. And it=20 wasn't clear whether the plan would keep the increasingly impatient=20 alternative producers from hauling one or both of the big utilities into=20 bankruptcy court, as some have threatened.=20 The shortage of power from the qualifying facilities -- plus a near-record=20 heat wave (downtown Sacramento topped off at 83 degrees, one degree short of=20 the 84 degree record set in 1960), a lack of hydropower and other problems --=20 prompted the state's Independent System Operator to order a second day of=20 blackouts starting mid-morning. But the blackouts hit only about half as many=20 Californians as Monday's, with late afternoon conservation efforts helping=20 balance supply with demand.=20 The blackouts, usually about an hour long, hit about 7,600 Sacramento=20 Municipal Utility District customers in Elk Grove and south Sacramento=20 County. PG&E customers in suburban counties were affected as well.=20 The order darkened shops in San Francisco's Chinatown and was blamed for a=20 crash that left two motorists seriously injured in the Los Angeles suburb of=20 South El Monte. A Sun Microsystems Inc. factory in Newark had to close for=20 several hours.=20 Most Californians took the blackouts in stride, though. Elk Grove High School=20 students filed outside to play hacky sack. Coffee shop patrons in Davis=20 milled outdoors, enjoying the unseasonably warm weather.=20 Yet the blackout order was met with outright defiance by one municipal=20 utility. The city of Lodi refused to cut power to its residents Monday or=20 Tuesday, saying it shouldn't have to suffer because of the financial crisis=20 afflicting PG&E and Edison.=20 The outlook for today and the near future was brighter, as several big power=20 plants came back on line after repairs. ISO officials also praised=20 Californians' conservation efforts, which had faltered in the morning but=20 came on strong in the afternoon, helping to prevent further blackouts. By=20 evening the grid was in a relatively mild Stage 2 power alert.=20 But the second day of blackouts -- plus an increasing threat of utility=20 bankruptcy -- pushed Davis to the brink. The governor cobbled together a=20 payment plan to rescue the qualifying facilities -- some 600 wind farms,=20 geothermal plants and other alternative-energy generators whose production=20 has become increasingly vital in recent days.=20 Under Davis' plan, the Legislature and the PUC would order PG&E and Edison to=20 pay the qualifying facilities for power delivered after April 1. The=20 utilities are required to buy power from the qualifying facilities under a=20 1978 federal law designed to bring cheaper and cleaner forms of electricity=20 to market.=20 Davis said the PUC would release a proposed order late Tuesday that would=20 require the utilities to pay the qualifying facilities $79 a megawatt hour=20 for five-year contracts or $69 for 10-year contracts. The Legislature also=20 would have to pass a law authorizing the PUC to issue such an order.=20 But the situation was far from resolved late Tuesday, and PG&E and Edison=20 were likely to oppose at least portions of Davis' plan.=20 Edison is willing only to make \"some kind of partial payments going forward,\"=20 said Thomas Higgins, a senior vice president with parent company Edison=20 International. \"We have a limited amount of resources available to us in=20 rates, ... and that's the constraining factor.\"=20 PG&E, which has been making partial payments to the qualifying facilities,=20 said it could pay them in advance, in full, for future power deliveries.=20 But PG&E said such payments would eat up half the $400 million it has=20 available each month to buy power -- and unless it gets a rate hike, there=20 wouldn't be enough to pay the qualifying facilities and cover other expenses,=20 including the cost of reimbursing the state Department of Water Resources for=20 the power the agency is buying on behalf of the troubled utility.=20 PG&E's proposal could represent a challenge of sorts to state officials:=20 Accept less money for the water department, or raise rates.=20 State officials \"need to resolve who they want to see paid,\" PG&E spokesman=20 John Nelson said. \"There is a limited pool of money.\"=20 For his part, Davis insisted that the water department would be first in line=20 to be paid, and he said the PUC will issue a proposed order to that effect.=20 \"We are getting paid before anybody else,\" Davis said.=20 Hundreds of qualifying facilities are out of commission because PG&E and=20 Edison haven't paid them. The situation has robbed the state of several=20 thousand badly needed megawatts and is a key reason blackouts have been=20 ordered. In normal times the facilities produce more than 20 percent of=20 California's electricity.=20 Some of the qualifying facilities have been threatening to haul one or both=20 of California's beleaguered utilities into bankruptcy court unless they get=20 paid soon, saying a bankruptcy filing might be the only way they can save=20 their businesses.=20 \"You've got to take care of the QF problem or the whole thing blacks out,\"=20 said Jerry Bloom, a lawyer representing one group of qualifying facilities.=20 \"(State officials) are starting to understand.\"=20 One thing that was fairly certain about Davis' still-sketchy payment plan: It=20 wouldn't cover PG&E and Edison's existing debt to the qualifying facilities,=20 estimated at more than $1.48 billion.=20 In their current financial state, the utilities say they can't afford to pay=20 the existing debt. In addition, paying the debt would create a major=20 complication: Other creditors, including the big power generators, would=20 surely haul Edison and PG&E into bankruptcy court on the grounds that they=20 weren't being treated fairly.=20 \"You can't give preferential payment treatment to one class of creditors over=20 another,\" PG&E's Nelson said. \"You virtually assure that (the other=20 creditors) have to file an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against you.\"=20 But without full payment, it wasn't clear how many of the qualifying=20 facilities would be able to restart.=20 Executives at several plants -- the ones that run on natural gas -- said=20 they're not sure their gas suppliers will deliver unless the existing debts=20 are cleared up.=20 \"We need to convince a gas company to supply us,\" said Ed Tomeo of UAE Energy=20 Operations Corp., which had to shut off its 40-megawatt Kern County plant=20 Tuesday. \"We're a company that already owes millions of dollars for gas=20 supplies.

The DWP, like Southern California Edison, was=20 affected by an outage at the huge Mohave power plant in Nevada, as well as by=20 planned outages at several of its facilities. ?????As in the past, by far the biggest impact was felt by customers served=20 by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which cut power to=20 438,000 homes and businesses. ?????Edison cut power to 47,462 customers in about 40 cities, but eventually=20 was able to avoid blackouts by shutting off the air conditioners of some of=20 the 118,500 customers who participate in a voluntary cutoff program. ?????San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to 73,400 customers.  ?????Innovative Ways of Coping ?????As on Monday, most people took the outages in stride, as an annoying but=20 ultimately unavoidable inconvenience. ?????In Palmdale, four schools lost power during one of the hourlong=20 blackouts, but teachers and students pressed on in the sunlight pouring=20 through windows and skylights. At Barrel Springs Elementary, Principal Cruz=20 Earls said the biggest problem came when students had to go to the bathroom:=20 Hand in hand, they made their way through darkened hallways with flashlights. ?????All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. Then again, the weather=20 wasn't that hot Tuesday, with a high of 79 in Palmdale, so the shutdown of=20 air conditioners wasn't much of a hardship. \"I don't want to think about the=20 conditions this could create in May or June,\" Earls said. ?????Businesses of all kinds complained about the lack of warning for the=20 outages--and sometimes found innovative ways to get around the problem. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, El Burrito=20 Mexican Food Products in the city of Industry started its Tuesday shift at 2=20 a.m. to beat the clock in the event of an outage. That hunch paid off.=20 Workers had just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa and=20 masa when the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????Company owner Mark Roth said the firm will continue working odd hours to=20 avoid further outages. But he isn't buying the line from the utilities that=20 they can't provide advance warning because of concerns about looting and=20 rioting. ?????\"We're ready to do whatever it takes to get through this thing,\" he=20 said. \"But they've got to give us some notification.\" ?????At Big O Tires in Elk Grove, just south of Sacramento, owner Daniel Crum=20 had his 14 workers take an early lunch break or head to the warehouse to=20 reorganize the goods. Without electricity, they couldn't repair brakes or=20 align front ends. ?????\"I'd never let them be idle,\" said Crum. ?????At least two minor traffic accidents were blamed on the outages. ?????The blackouts resulted from a convergence of factors. ?????Demand was slightly higher than expected, probably because of=20 unseasonably warm weather. Supplies were tighter than usual, in part because=20 of several outages, including that at the Mohave plant, half of which was=20 brought back on line by the end of the day. ?????The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was still limping along=20 without power from one of its two 1,100-megawatt units, which was shut down=20 Feb. 3 after a half-hour fire in a nonnuclear part of the plant. Edison,=20 which operates San Onofre, initially estimated the unit would be out for=20 several weeks but recently said \"extensive damage\" to parts of the turbine=20 will keep the unit out of commission until mid-June. ?????Shipments from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, which generates=20 most of its electricity from large dams, were also down. ?????\"Each time we take a measurement, we're closer to the all-time record=20 for the driest year,\" said Dulcy Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power=20 Administration, the network of federal dams that provides the region with=20 much of its electricity. \"We've been doing what we can, but we simply don't=20 have power to sell.\" ?????Finally, there was the problem of the small and alternative energy=20 producers, which have shut down plants because they haven't been paid by the=20 private utilities since November. Those outages have cost the state about=20 3,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 2.3 million homes. ?????\"You're seeing the system freeze up,\" said David Sokol, chairman and CEO=20 of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which runs eight geothermal plants in the=20 Imperial Valley through its subsidiary, CalEnergy. His company hasn't shut=20 down yet, but Sokol said smaller companies couldn't continue to sell their=20 energy to utilities for free. ?????\"Why should we fund Edison?\" he asked. \"That's just ridiculous.\"  ?????A Choice of 2 Rate Plans ?????Davis joined lawmakers in the Capitol on Tuesday to outline his plan to=20 get the producers running again. He said utilities have had no right to=20 collect money from ratepayers and then not use the funds to repay the small=20 producers. The state has spent billions to buy power from large conventional=20 producers on behalf of the utilities but has refused to pick up the tab for=20 alternative energy. ?????\"The utilities acted in a shameful manner by putting money in their=20 pockets that was designed to pay the [small producers],\" Davis said. ?????The plan outlined by Davis would allow the generators to choose between=20 two rate plans. They could decide to be paid 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour over=20 five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ?????The utilities must begin paying the generators the new rates beginning=20 April 1 or face fines, Davis said. ?????The question of how the companies will get paid the about $1.5 billion=20 they are owed remains unresolved. That issue will be decided in coming weeks=20 as Davis' negotiators continue to work on rescue plans for the state's=20 financially hobbled private utilities. ?????PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the state's largest utility did not take=20 kindly to Davis' criticism, and noted that the governor's plan is similar to=20 a proposal that PG&E made last week to producers. ?????Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of a trade group that includes some=20 of the small generators, described the plan as a positive step. ?????\"The governor got it right in that it's not acceptable for small power=20 producers to continue to generate and not be paid,\" Smutny-Jones said. \"But=20 we'll need to see what the order says; the devil will truly be in the=20 details.\" ?????Grid operators said the state's overall energy situation eased by midday=20 Tuesday because of repairs at the Mohave plant and another large plant at=20 Ormond Beach, and because the Western Area Power Administration came up with=20 300 megawatts of electricity from Glen Canyon Dam. ?????Also, grid spokesman Patrick Dorinson said conservation savings spiked=20 upward after earlier complaints that Californians weren't conserving. ?????\"We saw the people of California probably conserve 900 megawatts today,\"=20 he said. \"That was probably the difference.\" ---=20 ?????Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Jose Cardenas, Marla Dickerson,=20 Noaki Schwartz, Nicholas Riccardi, Doug Smith, Rebecca Trounson and Richard=20 Winton in Los Angeles, Miguel Bustillo and Julie Tamaki in Sacramento, Maria=20 La Ganga in San Francisco, Stanley Allison, Matt Ebnet, Scott Martelle,=20 Dennis McLellan, Monte Morin, Jason Song, Mai Tran and Nancy Wride in Orange=20 County, and Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this story. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- Fragile Supply Network Apt to Fail=20  By JENIFER WARREN and ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writers=20  ?????A lot of people were caught off guard by the blackouts that swept over=20 California this week. Debra Bowen wasn't one of them. ?????As chairwoman of the state Senate Energy Committee, she is=20 intimately--and painfully--familiar with the state's energy supply. And she=20 is willing to share a secret: It's a fragile system, capable of collapse at=20 any time. ?????That knowledge keeps Bowen awake at night, particularly with the=20 approach of summer, when power demand surges as Californians get reacquainted=20 with their air conditioners. ?????\"I sound a bit less like Chicken Little today, don't I?\" Bowen said=20 Tuesday, as chunks of the state once again were forcibly darkened. \"I know a=20 lot of people don't feel we have a problem. But we have a very, very big=20 problem.\" ?????With the recent slowdown in Stage 3 emergencies, a sense of calm had=20 settled over the energy debate, and even some legislators were speaking with=20 guarded optimism about the hot months ahead. ?????On Tuesday, however, a creeping sense of doom was almost palpable among=20 energy watchers, and previous supply forecasts--which predict that the state=20 may yet escape summer blackouts--were being given a second look. ?????\"The outages of the last two days are something that Californians are=20 going to have to get used to for July and August,\" said Michael Zenker,=20 California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The=20 Massachusetts consulting firm is predicting about 20 hours of blackouts this=20 summer. ?????At the California Independent System Operator, which manages 75% of the=20 statewide power grid, officials said the energy cushion the state had in=20 recent weeks was, in some ways, a phantom caused by heavy imports of power. ?????Cal-ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said people may have been deluded=20 into a false state of comfort: \"Maybe there is a tendency to think things=20 have improved,\" he said. In fact, they haven't. ?????More than anything, this week's events illustrate the delicate balance=20 of factors that keep California illuminated, from the multitude of supply=20 sources to the weather. ?????Temperatures were higher than usual. Alternative-energy suppliers--who=20 haven't been paid in months by the cash-strapped utilities--cut their output.=20 Suppliers in the Northwest--which faces a drought--slashed exports. Equipment=20 breakdowns and maintenance at power plants--much of it unanticipated--took=20 13,000 megawatts offline. A utility-run program that gives businesses=20 discounts in exchange for cutting power during emergencies is all but dead. ?????\"The fragility of the system is such that a small perturbation can turn=20 everything upside down very easily,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director=20 of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group of electricity generators and=20 traders. ?????One factor receiving particular attention is the dip in supply caused by=20 unscheduled maintenance. To help officials predict available supply,=20 generators provide an annual maintenance plan that is updated regularly. ?????In addition, however, facilities sometimes shut down for unexpected=20 reasons: leaking tubes, burnt-out transformers, cracked turbines and faulty=20 feed pumps. At one point Tuesday, about 8,200 megawatts were unavailable=20 because of unscheduled shutdowns. That's enough to supply about 6 million=20 households, and up from 5,700 megawatts a week ago. ?????The huge 1,400-megawatt Mohave power plant near Laughlin, Nev., which=20 supplies Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water=20 and Power, was felled Monday by a transformer problem. That was enough to=20 push the state into blackouts. ?????A growing number of skeptics, however, question whether those reasons=20 are always valid, accusing generators of withholding power to shrink supply=20 and drive up prices. ?????\"There's no way to verify it, so you've got to take their word for it,\"=20 said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies California's=20 electricity market. \"And given that it's very profitable for these things to=20 occur, you start to wonder if they're creating an artificial scarcity.\" ?????Tom Williams of Duke Energy said the Houston-based company is working=20 hard to keep its California power plants, which are capable of producing=20 3,351 megawatts of electricity, in operation after months of near-continuous=20 operation. ?????\"It's like riding a moped across the country,\" he said. \"They're just=20 not meant to run this hard.\" ?????Last week, the state Senate formed a committee to investigate charges of=20 market manipulation by power suppliers. The chairman, state Sen. Joe Dunn=20 (D-Santa Ana), says the issue of unscheduled plant shutdowns is on his agenda. ?????\"The problem is: How does one prove that a particular outage was part of=20 a deliberate strategy to deprive the state of kilowatts, rather than a result=20 of normal business operations?\" Dunn said. ---=20 ?????Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this story. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- Elevator Anxiety Is Riding High=20  Emergencies: Workers in skyscrapers worry about blackouts trapping them in=20 their buildings.

The findings=20 support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional=20 revenue by manipulating the market. ?????Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation. ?????The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is=20 central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers=20 excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis. ?????\"This might be the first time we told them the total impact and=20 magnitude [of the overcharging],\" said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director of=20 market analysis. \"We think the entire amount deserves consideration for=20 refunds.\" ?????Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity=20 sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of=20 the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities=20 engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices: ?????* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices,=20 even though they could have made some money selling more electricity. ?????* Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid=20 at all. ?????The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their=20 electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average=20 markup in August was 100% during peak hours. ?????A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which=20 oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country, declined to=20 comment Wednesday, saying, \"This is part of an ongoing proceeding.\" ?????FERC member William L. Massey, who has considered previous commission=20 actions on refunds to be inadequate, said it would be improper for him to=20 comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the=20 $5.5-billion total, Massey said: \"That doesn't shock me in any way.\" ?????\"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the=20 federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have=20 exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,\" he said. ?????Cal-ISO, which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market,=20 previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and=20 January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds=20 of only a tiny fraction of that amount. ?????The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy,=20 Dynegy, Williams\/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, formerly Southern Energy--plus=20 16 power importers, all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas &=20 Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. ?????\"All [21] overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate=20 amounts,\" Sheffrin said. ?????Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each=20 company, but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code will=20 be provided to FERC, Sheffrin said, and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how=20 much information about the companies will be made public.  ?????State, U.S. Investigations ?????California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power=20 in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and=20 federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in=20 May. ?????Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California=20 market in any way, whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or=20 through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices. ?????Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and is=20 confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were=20 justified, said Joe Bob Perkins, president of the Houston-based company. ?????Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units=20 so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants.=20 These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in the=20 state. ?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typically=20 don't include such fixed costs as salaries, taxes and the interest on bonds=20 they sold to finance their power plants, which they acquired under terms of=20 the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law. ?????In addition, he said, many high-priced power days have resulted from=20 buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers=20 charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the=20 listing price in a hot real estate market. ?????Williams Energy Services, a trading company that markets most of the=20 power produced by plants owned by AES, also says it will be exonerated by=20 FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted, said Paula=20 Hill-Collins, spokeswoman for the Tulsa, Okla., company. ?????\"FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are=20 made,\" Hill-Collins said. \"This is just a process of justification, not=20 necessarily proof of guilt.\" ?????Williams\/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take=20 generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices, or=20 refund $10.8 million to California utilities. ?????During the period studied, suppliers sold electricity in the California=20 Power Exchange to Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &=20 Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by=20 Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt, and=20 most suppliers stopped selling to them in January, forcing the state=20 Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for=20 the three big utilities' 27 million customers. ?????The Cal-ISO study, first summarized at an energy conference last week at=20 UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized, concluded that the companies=20 exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices. ?????Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley, said=20 Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices=20 in 2000. ?????\"We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive=20 pricing,\" he said. \"When the market was tight this summer, they were able to=20 push up prices, and they did.\" ?????The early warning signs of electricity price spikes, the study found,=20 appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 per=20 megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer, dipped in=20 September and October with lower demand, then took off in November and=20 December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas, which is used=20 to generate much of the state's electricity, reached record levels. ?????\"There were plant outages, and demand and supply became close,\" Sheffrin=20 said. \"Whatever price they bid had to be taken, and market power asserted=20 itself.\" ?????Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred=20 between May and November. ?????On Friday, federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to=20 refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in=20 February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430=20 per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts, when supplies are so tight=20 that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough=20 electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.) ?????The previous week, FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69=20 million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour. ?????Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were=20 limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and because=20 the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt more=20 than 70,000 transactions from scrutiny. ?????\"We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost, which is=20 Stage 3 alerts,\" said Massey, one of three commissioners on the five-member=20 board (two seats are vacant). ?????Generators \"have been given the free and clear,\" he said. ?????\"These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are=20 almost a joke,\" said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, senior attorney at the=20 Utility Reform Network.  ?????Resisting Price Caps ?????Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators can=20 no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what=20 the market will bear. ?????\"FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers'=20 own showing that they could not manipulate prices, yet their actions have=20 shown the contrary,\" Sheffrin said. \"We feel FERC needs to look at the=20 premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at market-based=20 rates.\" ?????The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable=20 electricity rates. Although it has called California's power market=20 dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation, the agency has resisted setting=20 firm price caps sought by California's congressional delegation. ?????Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr. strongly opposes caps, while Massey wants to=20 use caps across the West as a \"temporary timeout.\" ?????Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, in a New York news conference=20 Wednesday, reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to=20 cope with California's energy crisis. ?????\"If we put price caps in place, there will be more blackouts, and=20 they'll be worse,\" Abraham said. ?????Cal-ISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff=20 recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation. FERC's proposal=20 includes strict coordination of power plant outages by Cal-ISO with reporting=20 of suspicious closures to FERC, and generator-by-generator bid caps tied to=20 costs. ---=20 ?????Reiterman reported from San Francisco, Rivera Brooks from Los Angeles.=20 Times staff writer Thomas S.

Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the=20 statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency. ?????But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained shut=20 down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them. ?????State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high=20 cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will=20 block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an=20 account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity. ?????And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis=20 and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts=20 for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to=20 7,000 megawatts previously claimed. ?????While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report=20 notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons,=20 including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by=20 July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, but=20 none have yet been issued. ?????\"We are exposed enormously this summer,\" Senate Energy Committee=20 chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report.=20 \"We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be.=20 We don't have a power fairy.\" ?????Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall=20 significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the=20 state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many=20 times those of long-term contracts. ?????After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist=20 who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested=20 that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the=20 state will need this summer. ?????\"We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of=20 2003,\" he said. ?????California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost=20 of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.

In fact, the state has lined up contracts for about half the amount=20 Davis had projected earlier this month.=20 If the state has to rely heavily on the volatile spot market, where the price=20 of electricity this summer could reach five times the state's contract price,=20 pressure could mount to raise the cap on the electricity rates consumers pay.=20 But Steven Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said, ``The governor has said=20 he's committed to work this in the existing rate structure, so that's the=20 plan.''=20 In the report sent to state lawmakers, the state Department of Water=20 Resources indicated that it had secured just more than 20 million=20 megawatt-hours for this year, leaving it far short of the 60 million=20 megawatt-hours needed.=20 ``This is just a progress report,'' Maviglio said. ``They did all this in=20 three weeks, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, and we have a=20 lot more to do.''=20 The state got into the power buying business in January, supplying it to the=20 state's nearly bankrupt utilities.=20 The state negotiated long-term contracts with generators to supply that power=20 at a reduced rate. Based on the report, the state will pay an average of $68=20 per megawatt-hour over the next 10 years -- significantly less than in=20 December when prices spiked higher than $300 per megawatt-hour but not as low=20 as the $55 Davis hoped to reach.=20 Most of this power, however, won't be delivered until 2004. From 2004 to=20 2006, the Department of Water Resources estimates, it has enough power under=20 contract. Until then, the amount falls short.=20 In 2001, it appears the state has about one-third of the power it needs. The=20 gap closes to about half in 2002 and two-thirds in 2003.=20 At a news conference in Los Angeles two weeks ago, Davis said the state would=20 have to buy only 30 to 45 percent of the power it needs this summer on the=20 open market.=20 At the time, critics said with only two-thirds of the power under contract, a=20 rate increase was almost inevitable. Even Davis' chief negotiator, S. David=20 Freeman, offered a bleak assessment for the summer, saying that all available=20 electricity has already been sold.=20 ``We'll be subject to extremely high prices,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford=20 professor who sits on a market committee for the Independent System Operator,=20 the agency that runs the state power grid.=20 Wolak said there are two main hopes for avoiding a price increase this=20 summer: Federal officials could cap the wholesale price, a step they've=20 resisted, or Californians can conserve an unprecedented amount of power. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- Crisis saps state surplus POWER CRISIS=20 Controller moves to block a transfer of funds, saying the $8.5 billion=20 surplus has been cut more than half since January=20 By Mike Taugher TIMES STAFF WRITER=20 The energy crisis has bled California's once-touted budget surplus by more=20 than half since taxpayers began buying electricity two months ago, leading a=20 top state finance official Wednesday to order an audit of the power purchases=20 and block Gov. Gray Davis' plan to transfer funds into a reserve account.=20 A booming economy last year produced a budget surplus that totaled $8.5=20 billion in January. But that figure now stands at about $3.2 billion,=20 according to Controller Kathleen Connell.=20 \"We started this year with a generous budget surplus,\" Connell said in a=20 statement announcing her decision to block what Davis administration=20 officials described as a routine transfer of surplus money. \"The energy=20 crisis has taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the=20 electricity purchases would put the fund at risk.\"=20 Meanwhile, the Davis administration released a report by David Freeman, the=20 governor's chief negotiator on power purchases, on the progress of executing=20 long-term agreements meant to stabilize the power buys.=20 According to the report, only about 40 percent of the electricity needed from=20 the open market this year has been lined up. That means the state could be=20 forced to continue buying a substantial amount of power on the highly=20 expensive spot market and further drain its coffers.=20 And a key regulatory panel is scheduled next week to issue a ruling that=20 would determine how quickly state funds will be replenished when it decides=20 what portion of electric bill payments should be allocated to the state=20 treasury, a decision that could include a rate increase to fully repay=20 taxpayers without further crippling the state's two largest electric=20 utilities.=20 The Public Utilities Commission also will consider whether it will force the=20 utilities to pay alternative energy producers, whose shutdowns this week=20 contributed to blackouts.=20 Connell's action underscores a growing nervousness over the sheer volume of=20 money that is being poured into energy buys, despite the fact that state=20 officials plan to replenish the treasury with up to $10 billion in loans that=20 will be repaid by electricity consumers.=20 The state has committed to spending $4.2 billion to date to keep lights on=20 since taxpayers were forced in mid-January to take over electricity buys from=20 the financially crippled utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern=20 California Edison. Tax money is going out at a clip of about $50 million a=20 day.=20 High prices already have brought PG&E and Edison to the brink of bankruptcy,=20 and now the state's surplus is at risk, according to Connell.=20 In addition to requesting an audit and announcing her intention to delay the=20 transfer to the reserve account, Connell said she wanted the administration=20 to send her office more information about the electricity purchases.=20 Davis' representatives questioned Connell's authority in trying to block the=20 funds transfer, which they called a routine accounting procedure, and accused=20 her of making political hay.=20 \"It is not helpful to the taxpayers or ratepayers or the people who just want=20 to keep the lights on, it isn't helpful to have the situation muddied like=20 this,\" said Sandy Harrison, a Finance Department spokesperson. \"We're sorry=20 it came up in this manner.\"=20 Connell and the administration have butted heads in recent weeks. The=20 controller wants to post details of the state's electricity purchases on her=20 Web site, a plan that have been delayed under pressure from Davis because of=20 the governor's concerns that releasing those details will allow power=20 generators and traders to sell at higher prices.=20 Harrison said administration officials believe Connell lacks the authority=20 either to block the funds transfer to a reserve account or to audit the state=20 water resources department.=20 Two days of widespread blackouts this week show how vulnerable the power grid=20 is to financial glitches. Although several factors combined to produce the=20 blackouts, state power officials say the outages could have been avoided if=20 the utilities were paying their bills to alternative energy producers.=20 Many of those producers, including clean-burning natural gas power plants,=20 wind, solar and geothermal energy developers, shut down enough production to=20 spell the difference between grid reliability and blackouts Monday and=20 Tuesday.=20 Davis called the utilities' failure to pay bills to those producers, known as=20 qualifying facilities, \"immoral.\" The QFs were either unable to buy gas from=20 their suppliers or were frustrated with the utilities' failure to pay them.=20 \"The utilities hoarded billions of dollars since November without paying any=20 money out,\" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. \"They've got the money --=20 we're pulling the trigger to make them pay it.\"=20 The utilities, however, say they are doing all they can to conserve enough=20 cash to continue operating. Together, they owe the QFs about $1.5 billion.=20 Next week, the PUC is scheduled to consider whether to force the utilities to=20 heed Davis' demand to pay the QFs, and it might also decide how much of=20 ratepayers' bill payments will be used to refund taxpayers for power buys.=20 PG&E says that under a formula proposed by the administration, the water=20 resources department would receive about 40 percent of the money collected=20 from ratepayers for power purchases.=20 The rest of that money, about $240 million, would have to be divided among=20 QFs, existing power contracts, operating PG&E's nuclear and hydroelectric=20 plants, and what hour-by-hour purchases the utility still must make on the=20 spot market, according to PG&E spokesman John Nelson.=20 \"There isn't enough to do that,\" he said.=20 That is making it increasingly likely that electric bills will be hiked,=20 according to a growing chorus of officials and experts.=20 Unless rates are raised, Nelson said, the only entity that can absorb a lack=20 of payment or a partial payment is the state treasury. Cutting off any others=20 will lead to electricity becoming unavailable and more blackouts, he said.=20 \"If they do it under existing rates -- given that the existing pool of money=20 is not enough -- who doesn't get paid or who gets a partial payment?\" Nelson=20 said. \"What's the only entity left with wiggle room? The state.\"=20 Rate hikes are also a sticking point in negotiations to bail out the=20 utilities through purchase of their transmission lines and other assets,=20 Maviglio said.=20 \"They want rate increases of significant magnitude, and we're not going=20 there,\" he said.=20 WE CAN TRIM STORY HERE IF NECESSARY, BUT KEEP TAGLINES AT BOTTOM=20 About one-third the electricity needed by the customers of California's three=20 major utility companies is produced by the companies themselves, one-third=20 comes from alternative producers who use environmentally friendly techniques=20 and one-third is bought on the open market.=20 The state stepped in to buy the one-third needed from the open market after=20 the utility companies ran out of cash and credit in January to make the=20 purchases themselves.=20 But that electricity has proven to be enormously expensive, and Davis has=20 planned to lower those prices by committing to long-term purchases.=20 Freeman's report on the progress of those long-term purchases, dated March 15=20 but released this week, said the state has finalized 19 contracts with seven=20 suppliers and reached 25 additional agreements.=20 Mike Taugher covers the environment and energy.

Assembly leaders said they may=20 try again today.=20 For most of Thursday, lawmakers scrutinized legislation they had overhauled=20 the night before to include Gov. Gray Davis' plan to force utilities to pay=20 solar, wind and small gas-fired suppliers. Such providers, called \"qualified=20 facilities,\" or QFs, provide more than 20 percent of California's=20 electricity, and their shutdowns were partly to blame for rolling blackouts=20 Monday and Tuesday.=20 Under the Democratic governor's plan, the state Public Utilities Commission=20 would determine prices at which alternative generators may sell power, but=20 legislation is needed to authorize the PUC action.=20 Lawmakers faced time pressures Thursday.

If such bankruptcies occur,=20 he added, the state with its multibillion-dollar debt would become \"just=20 another creditor in a pile of creditors.\"=20 But Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell of Villa Park said the=20 finger-pointing is unfair.

CalEnergy said=20 it is owed $45 million by Edison.=20 If the Imperial County judge hadn't ruled in CalEnergy's favor, the company=20 and seven other QFs \"were fully prepared\" to file an involuntary bankruptcy=20 petition against Edison this morning, said David Sokol, chief executive of=20 CalEnergy's parent, MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. of Des Moines, Iowa.=20 \"That is currently off the table.\"=20 An involuntary bankruptcy proceeding would take California's energy crisis=20 into uncharted territory, although a bankruptcy judge would have the leeway=20 to reject the filing.=20 Freed from its contract with Edison, CalEnergy will move to sell its=20 electricity \"to people who will pay for it,\" Sokol said.=20 Besides calming the bankruptcy movement temporarily, the ruling also could=20 prompt other alternative energy providers -- hundreds of which have shut down=20 because of nonpayment by Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- to follow=20 CalEnergy's example and find other buyers for their electricity, said Gary=20 Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of generators.=20 Assembly Republicans said they felt the Senate's decision to package three=20 important energy issues into a single bill was an attempt to ramrod=20 legislation through both houses.=20 \"We have to stand and say no,\" Campbell said during floor debate.=20 Besides determining alternative generator payments, the bill would change an=20 earlier law by capping the value of bonds the state may sell for power=20 purchases at $10 billion. It also would extend to large businesses an=20 existing rate cap in the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. service area.=20 And it would earmark a portion of rates paid by utility customers to fund the=20 state's ongoing power purchases. Within a week, the state will have spent=20 $4.2 billion on power since January.=20 Without the bill, some legislators fear, Pacific Gas and Electric and=20 Southern California Edison would be reimbursed before the state.=20 \"They have got (some) gall to go to the PUC and say they're going to go to=20 court to keep our money -- to keep our money to pay off their creditors,\"=20 said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.=20 Most of the bill's controversy, however, centered on how the PUC would treat=20 gas-fired alternative generators.=20 The commission issued a revised draft decision Wednesday that would impose=20 prices for qualifying facilities at $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year=20 contracts or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years.=20 But those producers that use natural gas -- representing about two-thirds of=20 the alternative energy providers in California -- spent Thursday arguing that=20 Davis' plan to rescue them would all but guarantee that they would go out of=20 business instead.=20 The plan -- ordering Edison and PG&E to pay them a fixed price for their=20 power -- would set rates well below the cost of natural gas, they said.=20 Democratic lawmakers tried to assure such producers that the PUC would set=20 prices that make business sense, even obtaining a letter to that effect from=20 Loretta Lynch, who heads the commission.=20 Davis has vowed to fine Edison and PG&E if they don't pay alternative=20 producers for future deliveries. But Sokol said his company isn't convinced=20 that Edison will pay.=20 Calling Edison a \"confrontive, in-your-face, nasty organization,\" Sokol said=20 the utility was \"sitting on $2 billion\" and not paying its bills.

Joe Barton,=20 chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and air quality=20 subcommittee.=20 Some form of federal controls to hold down escalating wholesale prices this=20 summer because of power shortages has been the most frequent appeal of=20 witnesses who testified before the panel during roughly 30 hours of hearings=20 over five days.=20 Such controls have been sought by the governors of California, Oregon and=20 Washington. As power shortages are forecast for other regions, states like=20 New York also have appealed for temporary price controls to halt gouging.=20 But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is responsible for=20 enforcing reasonable wholesale rates under the Federal Power Act, has refused=20 to impose them, and the Bush administration is bolstering that decision by=20 opposing any legislation that would compel such action.=20 Barton, in a brief hallway interview, declined to say what other legislative=20 remedies he might propose to address the worsening California situation.=20 He said he expects to submit a list of ideas to the White House today, and=20 after receiving comment on it, sit down with other committee Republicans and=20 Democrats next week to see if any legislation is in order.=20 \"If we are going to do anything to help California or the West this summer,=20 we have to make it law within the next month or six weeks,\" Barton said.=20 Even the panel's senior Democrat, Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, was urging a=20 \"careful and deliberate approach\" to the California crisis, which he said was=20 largely of the state's own making.=20 There are steps Congress might take to provide some help to the West, such as=20 more money for conservation and relaxed federal regulation of air quality=20 standards. That would permit older, more polluting generators to operate=20 through a long, hot summer when electricity demand could exceed supply by=20 about 3,000 megawatts, roughly the amount needed to power 3 million homes.=20 But Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said power=20 production already is being maximized without sacrificing air quality.=20 \"Simply put, no essential electricity generation has been curtailed due to=20 air emission limitations,\" he said. \"California's programs to protect public=20 health are not major factors in the electricity shortages experienced to=20 date.\"=20 The concern is that as shortages turn into more rolling blackouts, wholesale=20 prices will jump even higher and steadily bleed the economies of California=20 and the West Coast.=20 William L. Massey, the lone member of the energy regulatory commission who=20 supports price controls, said at a Tuesday hearing that without them the West=20 Coast faces economic catastrophe this summer.=20 It was evident from the comments of some Republicans that they think their=20 party could capitalize politically from a difficult summer.=20 \"If they had a bad summer, it could show up in the polls,\" said Rep. Charlie=20 Norwood, R-Ga. \"And sometimes that's not a bad idea.\"=20 One of the most dramatic exchanges during the weeklong hearings came Thursday=20 with S.

Gray Davis to handle=20 the crisis on his own, suddenly came to life Thursday, jolted by this week's=20 unexpected rolling blackouts and threats by creditors to force the utilities=20 into bankruptcy court. Lawmakers quickly fashioned a basketful of legislation=20 aimed -- or so they hope -- at increasing power supplies, promoting=20 conservation and relieving the financial pressure on utilities and=20 electricity generators. But it may be too little, too late -- and Davis and=20 other politicians are already pointing fingers of blame, aware that a=20 political price will be paid if the apocalypse strikes.=20 While Davis chants his mantra that he inherited a fatally flawed utility=20 deregulation scheme from predecessor Pete Wilson, Republicans are blaming=20 Davis for moving too slowly after the crisis first surfaced last summer, and=20 even some of Davis' fellow Democrats are distancing themselves from the=20 governor.=20 \"Deregulation was a product of a Republican governor, a Republican author and=20 a Republican PUC (Public Utilities Commission) that was unduly impatient,\"=20 Davis said at one point this week as the Capitol buzzed with private=20 negotiations and public posturing.=20 A day later, however, state Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, issued a=20 warning that Davis' power purchases, running at $50 million a day, had=20 already drawn down state budget reserves by nearly two-thirds, and she=20 refused to authorize additional transfers.

They're nervous=20 because Davis has refused to reveal, even to legislators, exactly how much=20 power the state is buying each day and how much it is paying.=20 From the few details that have been disclosed, it's clear that the state is=20 spending about $1.5 billion a month, which would wipe out the state's=20 reserves by midsummer. It's also becoming increasingly clear that Davis=20 probably can't make good on his promise to avoid major consumer rate=20 increases, unless the state is willing to plunge deeply and semi-permanently=20 into debt to underwrite wholesale costs, or unless federal authorities order=20 huge refunds from power suppliers.=20 Rates in areas served by private utilities have risen only slightly while the=20 costs, first to utilities and later to the state, soared. Data from the=20 administration and utilities, when collated, indicate that the state is in=20 line to collect just 20 cents for every dollar it's spending on power=20 purchases, and the gap will increase as summer heat drives up demand.=20 Privately, some economists say that private utility rates will have to rise=20 33 percent to 50 percent to cover costs of current power supplies, plus=20 utilities' past debts to generators and the state's purchase of the=20 utilities' transmission system, if that deal is made final.=20 \"It's ultimately going to break down, and the ratepayer is going to pay for=20 it one way or the other,\" Republican Sen.

In fact, the state has lined up contracts for about half the amount=20 Davis had projected earlier this month.=20 If the state has to rely heavily on the volatile spot market, where the price=20 of electricity this summer could reach five times the state's contract price,=20 pressure could mount to raise the cap on the electricity rates consumers pay.=20 But Steven Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said, ``The governor has said=20 he's committed to work this in the existing rate structure, so that's the=20 plan.''=20 In the report sent to state lawmakers, the state Department of Water=20 Resources indicated that it had secured just more than 20 million=20 megawatt-hours for this year, leaving it far short of the 60 million=20 megawatt-hours needed.=20 ``This is just a progress report,'' Maviglio said. ``They did all this in=20 three weeks, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, and we have a=20 lot more to do.''=20 The state got into the power buying business in January, supplying it to the=20 state's nearly bankrupt utilities.=20 The state negotiated long-term contracts with generators to supply that power=20 at a reduced rate. Based on the report, the state will pay an average of $68=20 per megawatt-hour over the next 10 years -- significantly less than in=20 December when prices spiked higher than $300 per megawatt-hour but not as low=20 as the $55 Davis hoped to reach.=20 Most of this power, however, won't be delivered until 2004. From 2004 to=20 2006, the Department of Water Resources estimates, it has enough power under=20 contract. Until then, the amount falls short.=20 In 2001, it appears the state has about one-third of the power it needs. The=20 gap closes to about half in 2002 and two-thirds in 2003.=20 At a news conference in Los Angeles two weeks ago, Davis said the state would=20 have to buy only 30 to 45 percent of the power it needs this summer on the=20 open market.=20 At the time, critics said with only two-thirds of the power under contract, a=20 rate increase was almost inevitable. Even Davis' chief negotiator, S. David=20 Freeman, offered a bleak assessment for the summer, saying that all available=20 electricity has already been sold.=20 ``We'll be subject to extremely high prices,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford=20 professor who sits on a market committee for the Independent System Operator,=20 the agency that runs the state power grid.=20 Wolak said there are two main hopes for avoiding a price increase this=20 summer: Federal officials could cap the wholesale price, a step they've=20 resisted, or Californians can conserve an unprecedented amount of power. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- Crisis saps state surplus POWER CRISIS=20 Controller moves to block a transfer of funds, saying the $8.5 billion=20 surplus has been cut more than half since January=20 By Mike Taugher TIMES STAFF WRITER=20 The energy crisis has bled California's once-touted budget surplus by more=20 than half since taxpayers began buying electricity two months ago, leading a=20 top state finance official Wednesday to order an audit of the power purchases=20 and block Gov. Gray Davis' plan to transfer funds into a reserve account.=20 A booming economy last year produced a budget surplus that totaled $8.5=20 billion in January. But that figure now stands at about $3.2 billion,=20 according to Controller Kathleen Connell.=20 \"We started this year with a generous budget surplus,\" Connell said in a=20 statement announcing her decision to block what Davis administration=20 officials described as a routine transfer of surplus money. \"The energy=20 crisis has taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the=20 electricity purchases would put the fund at risk.\"=20 Meanwhile, the Davis administration released a report by David Freeman, the=20 governor's chief negotiator on power purchases, on the progress of executing=20 long-term agreements meant to stabilize the power buys.=20 According to the report, only about 40 percent of the electricity needed from=20 the open market this year has been lined up. That means the state could be=20 forced to continue buying a substantial amount of power on the highly=20 expensive spot market and further drain its coffers.=20 And a key regulatory panel is scheduled next week to issue a ruling that=20 would determine how quickly state funds will be replenished when it decides=20 what portion of electric bill payments should be allocated to the state=20 treasury, a decision that could include a rate increase to fully repay=20 taxpayers without further crippling the state's two largest electric=20 utilities.=20 The Public Utilities Commission also will consider whether it will force the=20 utilities to pay alternative energy producers, whose shutdowns this week=20 contributed to blackouts.=20 Connell's action underscores a growing nervousness over the sheer volume of=20 money that is being poured into energy buys, despite the fact that state=20 officials plan to replenish the treasury with up to $10 billion in loans that=20 will be repaid by electricity consumers.=20 The state has committed to spending $4.2 billion to date to keep lights on=20 since taxpayers were forced in mid-January to take over electricity buys from=20 the financially crippled utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern=20 California Edison. Tax money is going out at a clip of about $50 million a=20 day.=20 High prices already have brought PG&E and Edison to the brink of bankruptcy,=20 and now the state's surplus is at risk, according to Connell.=20 In addition to requesting an audit and announcing her intention to delay the=20 transfer to the reserve account, Connell said she wanted the administration=20 to send her office more information about the electricity purchases.=20 Davis' representatives questioned Connell's authority in trying to block the=20 funds transfer, which they called a routine accounting procedure, and accused=20 her of making political hay.=20 \"It is not helpful to the taxpayers or ratepayers or the people who just want=20 to keep the lights on, it isn't helpful to have the situation muddied like=20 this,\" said Sandy Harrison, a Finance Department spokesperson. \"We're sorry=20 it came up in this manner.\"=20 Connell and the administration have butted heads in recent weeks. The=20 controller wants to post details of the state's electricity purchases on her=20 Web site, a plan that have been delayed under pressure from Davis because of=20 the governor's concerns that releasing those details will allow power=20 generators and traders to sell at higher prices.=20 Harrison said administration officials believe Connell lacks the authority=20 either to block the funds transfer to a reserve account or to audit the state=20 water resources department.=20 Two days of widespread blackouts this week show how vulnerable the power grid=20 is to financial glitches. Although several factors combined to produce the=20 blackouts, state power officials say the outages could have been avoided if=20 the utilities were paying their bills to alternative energy producers.=20 Many of those producers, including clean-burning natural gas power plants,=20 wind, solar and geothermal energy developers, shut down enough production to=20 spell the difference between grid reliability and blackouts Monday and=20 Tuesday.=20 Davis called the utilities' failure to pay bills to those producers, known as=20 qualifying facilities, \"immoral.\" The QFs were either unable to buy gas from=20 their suppliers or were frustrated with the utilities' failure to pay them.=20 \"The utilities hoarded billions of dollars since November without paying any=20 money out,\" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. \"They've got the money --=20 we're pulling the trigger to make them pay it.\"=20 The utilities, however, say they are doing all they can to conserve enough=20 cash to continue operating. Together, they owe the QFs about $1.5 billion.=20 Next week, the PUC is scheduled to consider whether to force the utilities to=20 heed Davis' demand to pay the QFs, and it might also decide how much of=20 ratepayers' bill payments will be used to refund taxpayers for power buys.=20 PG&E says that under a formula proposed by the administration, the water=20 resources department would receive about 40 percent of the money collected=20 from ratepayers for power purchases.=20 The rest of that money, about $240 million, would have to be divided among=20 QFs, existing power contracts, operating PG&E's nuclear and hydroelectric=20 plants, and what hour-by-hour purchases the utility still must make on the=20 spot market, according to PG&E spokesman John Nelson.=20 \"There isn't enough to do that,\" he said.=20 That is making it increasingly likely that electric bills will be hiked,=20 according to a growing chorus of officials and experts.=20 Unless rates are raised, Nelson said, the only entity that can absorb a lack=20 of payment or a partial payment is the state treasury. Cutting off any others=20 will lead to electricity becoming unavailable and more blackouts, he said.=20 \"If they do it under existing rates -- given that the existing pool of money=20 is not enough -- who doesn't get paid or who gets a partial payment?\" Nelson=20 said. \"What's the only entity left with wiggle room? The state.\"=20 Rate hikes are also a sticking point in negotiations to bail out the=20 utilities through purchase of their transmission lines and other assets,=20 Maviglio said.=20 \"They want rate increases of significant magnitude, and we're not going=20 there,\" he said.=20 WE CAN TRIM STORY HERE IF NECESSARY, BUT KEEP TAGLINES AT BOTTOM=20 About one-third the electricity needed by the customers of California's three=20 major utility companies is produced by the companies themselves, one-third=20 comes from alternative producers who use environmentally friendly techniques=20 and one-third is bought on the open market.=20 The state stepped in to buy the one-third needed from the open market after=20 the utility companies ran out of cash and credit in January to make the=20 purchases themselves.=20 But that electricity has proven to be enormously expensive, and Davis has=20 planned to lower those prices by committing to long-term purchases.=20 Freeman's report on the progress of those long-term purchases, dated March 15=20 but released this week, said the state has finalized 19 contracts with seven=20 suppliers and reached 25 additional agreements.=20 Mike Taugher covers the environment and energy.

Assembly leaders said they may=20 try again today.=20 For most of Thursday, lawmakers scrutinized legislation they had overhauled=20 the night before to include Gov. Gray Davis' plan to force utilities to pay=20 solar, wind and small gas-fired suppliers. Such providers, called \"qualified=20 facilities,\" or QFs, provide more than 20 percent of California's=20 electricity, and their shutdowns were partly to blame for rolling blackouts=20 Monday and Tuesday.=20 Under the Democratic governor's plan, the state Public Utilities Commission=20 would determine prices at which alternative generators may sell power, but=20 legislation is needed to authorize the PUC action.=20 Lawmakers faced time pressures Thursday.

If such bankruptcies occur,=20 he added, the state with its multibillion-dollar debt would become \"just=20 another creditor in a pile of creditors.\"=20 But Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell of Villa Park said the=20 finger-pointing is unfair.

CalEnergy said=20 it is owed $45 million by Edison.=20 If the Imperial County judge hadn't ruled in CalEnergy's favor, the company=20 and seven other QFs \"were fully prepared\" to file an involuntary bankruptcy=20 petition against Edison this morning, said David Sokol, chief executive of=20 CalEnergy's parent, MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. of Des Moines, Iowa.=20 \"That is currently off the table.\"=20 An involuntary bankruptcy proceeding would take California's energy crisis=20 into uncharted territory, although a bankruptcy judge would have the leeway=20 to reject the filing.=20 Freed from its contract with Edison, CalEnergy will move to sell its=20 electricity \"to people who will pay for it,\" Sokol said.=20 Besides calming the bankruptcy movement temporarily, the ruling also could=20 prompt other alternative energy providers -- hundreds of which have shut down=20 because of nonpayment by Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- to follow=20 CalEnergy's example and find other buyers for their electricity, said Gary=20 Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of generators.=20 Assembly Republicans said they felt the Senate's decision to package three=20 important energy issues into a single bill was an attempt to ramrod=20 legislation through both houses.=20 \"We have to stand and say no,\" Campbell said during floor debate.=20 Besides determining alternative generator payments, the bill would change an=20 earlier law by capping the value of bonds the state may sell for power=20 purchases at $10 billion. It also would extend to large businesses an=20 existing rate cap in the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. service area.=20 And it would earmark a portion of rates paid by utility customers to fund the=20 state's ongoing power purchases. Within a week, the state will have spent=20 $4.2 billion on power since January.=20 Without the bill, some legislators fear, Pacific Gas and Electric and=20 Southern California Edison would be reimbursed before the state.=20 \"They have got (some) gall to go to the PUC and say they're going to go to=20 court to keep our money -- to keep our money to pay off their creditors,\"=20 said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.=20 Most of the bill's controversy, however, centered on how the PUC would treat=20 gas-fired alternative generators.=20 The commission issued a revised draft decision Wednesday that would impose=20 prices for qualifying facilities at $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year=20 contracts or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years.=20 But those producers that use natural gas -- representing about two-thirds of=20 the alternative energy providers in California -- spent Thursday arguing that=20 Davis' plan to rescue them would all but guarantee that they would go out of=20 business instead.=20 The plan -- ordering Edison and PG&E to pay them a fixed price for their=20 power -- would set rates well below the cost of natural gas, they said.=20 Democratic lawmakers tried to assure such producers that the PUC would set=20 prices that make business sense, even obtaining a letter to that effect from=20 Loretta Lynch, who heads the commission.=20 Davis has vowed to fine Edison and PG&E if they don't pay alternative=20 producers for future deliveries. But Sokol said his company isn't convinced=20 that Edison will pay.=20 Calling Edison a \"confrontive, in-your-face, nasty organization,\" Sokol said=20 the utility was \"sitting on $2 billion\" and not paying its bills.

Joe Barton,=20 chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and air quality=20 subcommittee.=20 Some form of federal controls to hold down escalating wholesale prices this=20 summer because of power shortages has been the most frequent appeal of=20 witnesses who testified before the panel during roughly 30 hours of hearings=20 over five days.=20 Such controls have been sought by the governors of California, Oregon and=20 Washington. As power shortages are forecast for other regions, states like=20 New York also have appealed for temporary price controls to halt gouging.=20 But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is responsible for=20 enforcing reasonable wholesale rates under the Federal Power Act, has refused=20 to impose them, and the Bush administration is bolstering that decision by=20 opposing any legislation that would compel such action.=20 Barton, in a brief hallway interview, declined to say what other legislative=20 remedies he might propose to address the worsening California situation.=20 He said he expects to submit a list of ideas to the White House today, and=20 after receiving comment on it, sit down with other committee Republicans and=20 Democrats next week to see if any legislation is in order.=20 \"If we are going to do anything to help California or the West this summer,=20 we have to make it law within the next month or six weeks,\" Barton said.=20 Even the panel's senior Democrat, Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, was urging a=20 \"careful and deliberate approach\" to the California crisis, which he said was=20 largely of the state's own making.=20 There are steps Congress might take to provide some help to the West, such as=20 more money for conservation and relaxed federal regulation of air quality=20 standards. That would permit older, more polluting generators to operate=20 through a long, hot summer when electricity demand could exceed supply by=20 about 3,000 megawatts, roughly the amount needed to power 3 million homes.=20 But Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said power=20 production already is being maximized without sacrificing air quality.=20 \"Simply put, no essential electricity generation has been curtailed due to=20 air emission limitations,\" he said. \"California's programs to protect public=20 health are not major factors in the electricity shortages experienced to=20 date.\"=20 The concern is that as shortages turn into more rolling blackouts, wholesale=20 prices will jump even higher and steadily bleed the economies of California=20 and the West Coast.=20 William L. Massey, the lone member of the energy regulatory commission who=20 supports price controls, said at a Tuesday hearing that without them the West=20 Coast faces economic catastrophe this summer.=20 It was evident from the comments of some Republicans that they think their=20 party could capitalize politically from a difficult summer.=20 \"If they had a bad summer, it could show up in the polls,\" said Rep. Charlie=20 Norwood, R-Ga. \"And sometimes that's not a bad idea.\"=20 One of the most dramatic exchanges during the weeklong hearings came Thursday=20 with S.

Gray Davis to handle=20 the crisis on his own, suddenly came to life Thursday, jolted by this week's=20 unexpected rolling blackouts and threats by creditors to force the utilities=20 into bankruptcy court. Lawmakers quickly fashioned a basketful of legislation=20 aimed -- or so they hope -- at increasing power supplies, promoting=20 conservation and relieving the financial pressure on utilities and=20 electricity generators. But it may be too little, too late -- and Davis and=20 other politicians are already pointing fingers of blame, aware that a=20 political price will be paid if the apocalypse strikes.=20 While Davis chants his mantra that he inherited a fatally flawed utility=20 deregulation scheme from predecessor Pete Wilson, Republicans are blaming=20 Davis for moving too slowly after the crisis first surfaced last summer, and=20 even some of Davis' fellow Democrats are distancing themselves from the=20 governor.=20 \"Deregulation was a product of a Republican governor, a Republican author and=20 a Republican PUC (Public Utilities Commission) that was unduly impatient,\"=20 Davis said at one point this week as the Capitol buzzed with private=20 negotiations and public posturing.=20 A day later, however, state Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, issued a=20 warning that Davis' power purchases, running at $50 million a day, had=20 already drawn down state budget reserves by nearly two-thirds, and she=20 refused to authorize additional transfers.

They're nervous=20 because Davis has refused to reveal, even to legislators, exactly how much=20 power the state is buying each day and how much it is paying.=20 From the few details that have been disclosed, it's clear that the state is=20 spending about $1.5 billion a month, which would wipe out the state's=20 reserves by midsummer. It's also becoming increasingly clear that Davis=20 probably can't make good on his promise to avoid major consumer rate=20 increases, unless the state is willing to plunge deeply and semi-permanently=20 into debt to underwrite wholesale costs, or unless federal authorities order=20 huge refunds from power suppliers.=20 Rates in areas served by private utilities have risen only slightly while the=20 costs, first to utilities and later to the state, soared. Data from the=20 administration and utilities, when collated, indicate that the state is in=20 line to collect just 20 cents for every dollar it's spending on power=20 purchases, and the gap will increase as summer heat drives up demand.=20 Privately, some economists say that private utility rates will have to rise=20 33 percent to 50 percent to cover costs of current power supplies, plus=20 utilities' past debts to generators and the state's purchase of the=20 utilities' transmission system, if that deal is made final.=20 \"It's ultimately going to break down, and the ratepayer is going to pay for=20 it one way or the other,\" Republican Sen.

Gray Davis said regulators will act=20 Tuesday on a plan to guarantee that independent power generators are paid. Independent power producers provide about 30 percent of California's=20 electricity from a variety of sources including wind, solar and other=20 sources. Because many of the companies, known as Qualifying Facilities, or=20 QFs, haven't been paid they've begun to withhold power, contributing to=20 blackouts in the state Monday and Tuesday.=20 \"We are anxious to pay the QFs because they're falling like flies,\" Davis=20 said at a news conference late Tuesday. \"If they don't get paid, the lights=20 will go out.\" Davis said the state's PUC order will require the state's nearly bankrupt=20 utilities to enter five-year contracts with the QFs at rates of 7.9 cents per=20 kilowatt hour, or 10-year contracts for lower rates.

Debra Bowen, chairwoman of the Senate Energy, Utilities and=20 Communications Committee, said the bill apparently has left room for utility=20 lawyers to argue that their companies needn't repay the state until they have=20 covered other costs.=20 But Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat who represents downtown and western Long=20 Beach, said \"the legislative intent is crystal clear\" that the state wanted=20 to be repaid directly for supplying about a third of the power utility=20 companies deliver to their customers.=20 \"We need a cleanup bill\" to set the matter straight, she said.=20 Although AB1X illustrates the flaws that come with speed, Bowen said, the=20 Legislature can't afford to delay.=20 \"I think we are much too slow in our response,\" she said. \"But that has to be=20 balanced against things we've done in a tearing hurry and then have had to=20 fix later.\"=20 No matter what the Legislature does in the coming weeks, she said, California=20 is in for a tough summer, and only determined conservation efforts will put=20 much of a dent in a precarious supply-demand equation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------- PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts=20 Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Wednesday, March 21, 2001=20 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle=20 Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other=20 alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a=20 proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening.=20 A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward=20 energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates.=20 Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which=20 would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who=20 requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities=20 that buy their power return to solvency.=20 Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for=20 not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or=20 \"QFs\" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates.=20 \"It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the=20 money designed to compensate the QFs,\" Davis said. \"It's immoral and has to=20 stop.\"=20 Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil=20 refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's=20 supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not=20 paid them since November.=20 The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers=20 contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday,=20 according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power=20 grid.=20 The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday=20 meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract=20 at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said.=20 The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more=20 than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor=20 one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings=20 from other creditors.=20 The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work.=20 \"It is critical to keep these facilities up and online,\" said Sen. Debra=20 Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash=20 on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. \"The utilities owe it to the people of the=20 state to pay them.\"=20 Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative=20 producers ahead of their other creditors.=20 But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes=20 alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the=20 governor's office about possible payment structures.=20 Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural=20 gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash=20 they must close their plants.=20 \"We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten=20 the health of everyone else,\" said V. John White, legislative director of the=20 Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers.=20 CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the=20 Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility=20 asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with=20 Edison which has paid them nothing since November.=20 CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes=20 the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day.=20 \"We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in=20 a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest=20 employer in the county,\" said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager.=20 Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar.=20 \"We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet=20 delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs=20 to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen=20 rates,\" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.=20 The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators=20 comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for=20 legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations=20 eventually failed to move forward.=20 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------- State claims $5.5 billion overcharge: Refunds by wholesale generators sought By Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writer (Published March 22, 2001)=20 In its boldest attempt yet to extract refunds from wholesale power=20 generators, the state's grid operator accused the generators Wednesday of=20 overcharging Californians by $5.5 billion for electricity since last May.=20 The state's Independent System Operator, which manages the state's=20 transmission grid, plans to tell a federal regulatory agency today that power=20 generators consistently took advantage of their stranglehold on the=20 California market to ratchet up prices.=20 The federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recently=20 threatened to order generators to refund $134.8 million for overcharges,=20 mostly covering January and February.

The findings=20 support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional=20 revenue by manipulating the market. ?????Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation. ?????The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is=20 central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers=20 excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis. ?????\"This might be the first time we told them the total impact and=20 magnitude [of the overcharging],\" said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director of=20 market analysis. \"We think the entire amount deserves consideration for=20 refunds.\" ?????Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity=20 sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of=20 the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities=20 engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices: ?????* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices,=20 even though they could have made some money selling more electricity. ?????* Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid=20 at all. ?????The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their=20 electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average=20 markup in August was 100% during peak hours. ?????A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which=20 oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country, declined to=20 comment Wednesday, saying, \"This is part of an ongoing proceeding.\" ?????FERC member William L. Massey, who has considered previous commission=20 actions on refunds to be inadequate, said it would be improper for him to=20 comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the=20 $5.5-billion total, Massey said: \"That doesn't shock me in any way.\" ?????\"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the=20 federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have=20 exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,\" he said. ?????Cal-ISO, which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market,=20 previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and=20 January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds=20 of only a tiny fraction of that amount. ?????The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy,=20 Dynegy, Williams\/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, formerly Southern Energy--plus=20 16 power importers, all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas &=20 Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. ?????\"All [21] overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate=20 amounts,\" Sheffrin said. ?????Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each=20 company, but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code will=20 be provided to FERC, Sheffrin said, and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how=20 much information about the companies will be made public.  ?????State, U.S. Investigations ?????California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power=20 in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and=20 federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in=20 May. ?????Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California=20 market in any way, whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or=20 through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices. ?????Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and is=20 confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were=20 justified, said Joe Bob Perkins, president of the Houston-based company. ?????Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units=20 so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants.=20 These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in the=20 state. ?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typically=20 don't include such fixed costs as salaries, taxes and the interest on bonds=20 they sold to finance their power plants, which they acquired under terms of=20 the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law. ?????In addition, he said, many high-priced power days have resulted from=20 buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers=20 charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the=20 listing price in a hot real estate market. ?????Williams Energy Services, a trading company that markets most of the=20 power produced by plants owned by AES, also says it will be exonerated by=20 FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted, said Paula=20 Hill-Collins, spokeswoman for the Tulsa, Okla., company. ?????\"FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are=20 made,\" Hill-Collins said. \"This is just a process of justification, not=20 necessarily proof of guilt.\" ?????Williams\/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take=20 generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices, or=20 refund $10.8 million to California utilities. ?????During the period studied, suppliers sold electricity in the California=20 Power Exchange to Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &=20 Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by=20 Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt, and=20 most suppliers stopped selling to them in January, forcing the state=20 Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for=20 the three big utilities' 27 million customers. ?????The Cal-ISO study, first summarized at an energy conference last week at=20 UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized, concluded that the companies=20 exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices. ?????Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley, said=20 Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices=20 in 2000. ?????\"We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive=20 pricing,\" he said. \"When the market was tight this summer, they were able to=20 push up prices, and they did.\" ?????The early warning signs of electricity price spikes, the study found,=20 appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 per=20 megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer, dipped in=20 September and October with lower demand, then took off in November and=20 December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas, which is used=20 to generate much of the state's electricity, reached record levels. ?????\"There were plant outages, and demand and supply became close,\" Sheffrin=20 said. \"Whatever price they bid had to be taken, and market power asserted=20 itself.\" ?????Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred=20 between May and November. ?????On Friday, federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to=20 refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in=20 February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430=20 per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts, when supplies are so tight=20 that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough=20 electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.) ?????The previous week, FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69=20 million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour. ?????Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were=20 limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and because=20 the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt more=20 than 70,000 transactions from scrutiny. ?????\"We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost, which is=20 Stage 3 alerts,\" said Massey, one of three commissioners on the five-member=20 board (two seats are vacant). ?????Generators \"have been given the free and clear,\" he said. ?????\"These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are=20 almost a joke,\" said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, senior attorney at the=20 Utility Reform Network.  ?????Resisting Price Caps ?????Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators can=20 no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what=20 the market will bear. ?????\"FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers'=20 own showing that they could not manipulate prices, yet their actions have=20 shown the contrary,\" Sheffrin said. \"We feel FERC needs to look at the=20 premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at market-based=20 rates.\" ?????The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable=20 electricity rates. Although it has called California's power market=20 dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation, the agency has resisted setting=20 firm price caps sought by California's congressional delegation. ?????Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr. strongly opposes caps, while Massey wants to=20 use caps across the West as a \"temporary timeout.\" ?????Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, in a New York news conference=20 Wednesday, reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to=20 cope with California's energy crisis. ?????\"If we put price caps in place, there will be more blackouts, and=20 they'll be worse,\" Abraham said. ?????Cal-ISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff=20 recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation. FERC's proposal=20 includes strict coordination of power plant outages by Cal-ISO with reporting=20 of suspicious closures to FERC, and generator-by-generator bid caps tied to=20 costs. ---=20 ?????Reiterman reported from San Francisco, Rivera Brooks from Los Angeles.=20 Times staff writer Thomas S.

Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the=20 statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency. ?????But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained shut=20 down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them. ?????State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high=20 cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will=20 block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an=20 account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity. ?????And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis=20 and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts=20 for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to=20 7,000 megawatts previously claimed. ?????While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report=20 notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons,=20 including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by=20 July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, but=20 none have yet been issued. ?????\"We are exposed enormously this summer,\" Senate Energy Committee=20 chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report.=20 \"We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be.=20 We don't have a power fairy.\" ?????Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall=20 significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the=20 state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many=20 times those of long-term contracts. ?????After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist=20 who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested=20 that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the=20 state will need this summer. ?????\"We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of=20 2003,\" he said. ?????California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost=20 of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed=20 billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the=20 spot market. ?????Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with=20 generators, said the report represents a \"work in progress.\" He said the=20 state may yet sign new contracts. ?????However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have=20 been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless=20 serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately. ?????Wolak and other ex","recipient_ids":[5074,3475,65279,65373,2157,48355,1489,11447,5128,253,1474,3161,4132,2238,1180,166,15283,1547,5416,3535,17095,2383,47920,28654,3495,181,4851,5894,817,1570,8546,2280,9060,1490,801,17182,17579,10758,8436,2326,18009,2160,1480,818,2219,803],"sender_id":4967,"datetime":985223040,"message_id":253809,"subject":"Energy Issues"}

Gray Davis said the=20 Public Utilities Commission and the Legislature would move promptly to order=20 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to start paying=20 those small energy producers for their electricity. Davis said the two=20 utilities will face \"considerable fines\" if they don't pay up.=20 But several of the producers, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" said they=20 doubted Davis' plan would go far enough to get them back in operation. And it=20 wasn't clear whether the plan would keep the increasingly impatient=20 alternative producers from hauling one or both of the big utilities into=20 bankruptcy court, as some have threatened.=20 The shortage of power from the qualifying facilities -- plus a near-record=20 heat wave (downtown Sacramento topped off at 83 degrees, one degree short of=20 the 84 degree record set in 1960), a lack of hydropower and other problems --=20 prompted the state's Independent System Operator to order a second day of=20 blackouts starting mid-morning. But the blackouts hit only about half as many=20 Californians as Monday's, with late afternoon conservation efforts helping=20 balance supply with demand.=20 The blackouts, usually about an hour long, hit about 7,600 Sacramento=20 Municipal Utility District customers in Elk Grove and south Sacramento=20 County. PG&E customers in suburban counties were affected as well.=20 The order darkened shops in San Francisco's Chinatown and was blamed for a=20 crash that left two motorists seriously injured in the Los Angeles suburb of=20 South El Monte. A Sun Microsystems Inc. factory in Newark had to close for=20 several hours.=20 Most Californians took the blackouts in stride, though. Elk Grove High School=20 students filed outside to play hacky sack. Coffee shop patrons in Davis=20 milled outdoors, enjoying the unseasonably warm weather.=20 Yet the blackout order was met with outright defiance by one municipal=20 utility. The city of Lodi refused to cut power to its residents Monday or=20 Tuesday, saying it shouldn't have to suffer because of the financial crisis=20 afflicting PG&E and Edison.=20 The outlook for today and the near future was brighter, as several big power=20 plants came back on line after repairs. ISO officials also praised=20 Californians' conservation efforts, which had faltered in the morning but=20 came on strong in the afternoon, helping to prevent further blackouts. By=20 evening the grid was in a relatively mild Stage 2 power alert.=20 But the second day of blackouts -- plus an increasing threat of utility=20 bankruptcy -- pushed Davis to the brink. The governor cobbled together a=20 payment plan to rescue the qualifying facilities -- some 600 wind farms,=20 geothermal plants and other alternative-energy generators whose production=20 has become increasingly vital in recent days.=20 Under Davis' plan, the Legislature and the PUC would order PG&E and Edison to=20 pay the qualifying facilities for power delivered after April 1. The=20 utilities are required to buy power from the qualifying facilities under a=20 1978 federal law designed to bring cheaper and cleaner forms of electricity=20 to market.=20 Davis said the PUC would release a proposed order late Tuesday that would=20 require the utilities to pay the qualifying facilities $79 a megawatt hour=20 for five-year contracts or $69 for 10-year contracts. The Legislature also=20 would have to pass a law authorizing the PUC to issue such an order.=20 But the situation was far from resolved late Tuesday, and PG&E and Edison=20 were likely to oppose at least portions of Davis' plan.=20 Edison is willing only to make \"some kind of partial payments going forward,\"=20 said Thomas Higgins, a senior vice president with parent company Edison=20 International. \"We have a limited amount of resources available to us in=20 rates, ... and that's the constraining factor.\"=20 PG&E, which has been making partial payments to the qualifying facilities,=20 said it could pay them in advance, in full, for future power deliveries.=20 But PG&E said such payments would eat up half the $400 million it has=20 available each month to buy power -- and unless it gets a rate hike, there=20 wouldn't be enough to pay the qualifying facilities and cover other expenses,=20 including the cost of reimbursing the state Department of Water Resources for=20 the power the agency is buying on behalf of the troubled utility.=20 PG&E's proposal could represent a challenge of sorts to state officials:=20 Accept less money for the water department, or raise rates.=20 State officials \"need to resolve who they want to see paid,\" PG&E spokesman=20 John Nelson said. \"There is a limited pool of money.\"=20 For his part, Davis insisted that the water department would be first in line=20 to be paid, and he said the PUC will issue a proposed order to that effect.=20 \"We are getting paid before anybody else,\" Davis said.=20 Hundreds of qualifying facilities are out of commission because PG&E and=20 Edison haven't paid them. The situation has robbed the state of several=20 thousand badly needed megawatts and is a key reason blackouts have been=20 ordered. In normal times the facilities produce more than 20 percent of=20 California's electricity.=20 Some of the qualifying facilities have been threatening to haul one or both=20 of California's beleaguered utilities into bankruptcy court unless they get=20 paid soon, saying a bankruptcy filing might be the only way they can save=20 their businesses.=20 \"You've got to take care of the QF problem or the whole thing blacks out,\"=20 said Jerry Bloom, a lawyer representing one group of qualifying facilities.=20 \"(State officials) are starting to understand.\"=20 One thing that was fairly certain about Davis' still-sketchy payment plan: It=20 wouldn't cover PG&E and Edison's existing debt to the qualifying facilities,=20 estimated at more than $1.48 billion.=20 In their current financial state, the utilities say they can't afford to pay=20 the existing debt. In addition, paying the debt would create a major=20 complication: Other creditors, including the big power generators, would=20 surely haul Edison and PG&E into bankruptcy court on the grounds that they=20 weren't being treated fairly.=20 \"You can't give preferential payment treatment to one class of creditors over=20 another,\" PG&E's Nelson said. \"You virtually assure that (the other=20 creditors) have to file an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against you.\"=20 But without full payment, it wasn't clear how many of the qualifying=20 facilities would be able to restart.=20 Executives at several plants -- the ones that run on natural gas -- said=20 they're not sure their gas suppliers will deliver unless the existing debts=20 are cleared up.=20 \"We need to convince a gas company to supply us,\" said Ed Tomeo of UAE Energy=20 Operations Corp., which had to shut off its 40-megawatt Kern County plant=20 Tuesday. \"We're a company that already owes millions of dollars for gas=20 supplies.

And Gov.

Wally Quirk teaches a business class in a borrowed classroom Tuesday at=20 Sonoma State after the state's rolling blackouts cut the power to his usual=20 classroom, which does not have any windows. SCOTT MANCHESTER \/ The Press Democrat  ?????The latest round of blackouts began about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when the=20 California Independent System Operator, which runs the statewide grid,=20 determined that the demand for electricity was 500 megawatts more than the=20 supply--an imbalance that meant the state was short on the power needed to=20 supply electricity to about 375,000 homes. ?????Grid operators blamed a confluence of events, including warmer weather;=20 outages at several major power plants, including one unit of the San Onofre=20 nuclear power station; a reduction in imports from the Pacific Northwest, and=20 the shutdown of many alternative energy producers. Similar blackouts Monday=20 were the first since January. ?????The situation improved somewhat by late Tuesday morning, with some=20 supplies restored and Californians conserving energy, and Cal-ISO was able to=20 halt the rolling blackouts at 2 p.m. ?????Once again, customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power=20 were spared, although the municipally owned utility said its electrical=20 surplus was smaller than usual. The DWP, like Southern California Edison, was=20 affected by an outage at the huge Mohave power plant in Nevada, as well as by=20 planned outages at several of its facilities. ?????As in the past, by far the biggest impact was felt by customers served=20 by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which cut power to=20 438,000 homes and businesses. ?????Edison cut power to 47,462 customers in about 40 cities, but eventually=20 was able to avoid blackouts by shutting off the air conditioners of some of=20 the 118,500 customers who participate in a voluntary cutoff program. ?????San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to 73,400 customers.  ?????Innovative Ways of Coping ?????As on Monday, most people took the outages in stride, as an annoying but=20 ultimately unavoidable inconvenience. ?????In Palmdale, four schools lost power during one of the hourlong=20 blackouts, but teachers and students pressed on in the sunlight pouring=20 through windows and skylights. At Barrel Springs Elementary, Principal Cruz=20 Earls said the biggest problem came when students had to go to the bathroom:=20 Hand in hand, they made their way through darkened hallways with flashlights. ?????All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. Then again, the weather=20 wasn't that hot Tuesday, with a high of 79 in Palmdale, so the shutdown of=20 air conditioners wasn't much of a hardship. \"I don't want to think about the=20 conditions this could create in May or June,\" Earls said. ?????Businesses of all kinds complained about the lack of warning for the=20 outages--and sometimes found innovative ways to get around the problem. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, El Burrito=20 Mexican Food Products in the city of Industry started its Tuesday shift at 2=20 a.m. to beat the clock in the event of an outage. That hunch paid off.=20 Workers had just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa and=20 masa when the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????Company owner Mark Roth said the firm will continue working odd hours to=20 avoid further outages.

Without electricity, they couldn't repair brakes or=20 align front ends. ?????\"I'd never let them be idle,\" said Crum. ?????At least two minor traffic accidents were blamed on the outages. ?????The blackouts resulted from a convergence of factors. ?????Demand was slightly higher than expected, probably because of=20 unseasonably warm weather. Supplies were tighter than usual, in part because=20 of several outages, including that at the Mohave plant, half of which was=20 brought back on line by the end of the day. ?????The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was still limping along=20 without power from one of its two 1,100-megawatt units, which was shut down=20 Feb. 3 after a half-hour fire in a nonnuclear part of the plant. Edison,=20 which operates San Onofre, initially estimated the unit would be out for=20 several weeks but recently said \"extensive damage\" to parts of the turbine=20 will keep the unit out of commission until mid-June. ?????Shipments from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, which generates=20 most of its electricity from large dams, were also down. ?????\"Each time we take a measurement, we're closer to the all-time record=20 for the driest year,\" said Dulcy Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power=20 Administration, the network of federal dams that provides the region with=20 much of its electricity. \"We've been doing what we can, but we simply don't=20 have power to sell.\" ?????Finally, there was the problem of the small and alternative energy=20 producers, which have shut down plants because they haven't been paid by the=20 private utilities since November. Those outages have cost the state about=20 3,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 2.3 million homes. ?????\"You're seeing the system freeze up,\" said David Sokol, chairman and CEO=20 of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which runs eight geothermal plants in the=20 Imperial Valley through its subsidiary, CalEnergy. His company hasn't shut=20 down yet, but Sokol said smaller companies couldn't continue to sell their=20 energy to utilities for free. ?????\"Why should we fund Edison?\" he asked. \"That's just ridiculous.\"  ?????A Choice of 2 Rate Plans ?????Davis joined lawmakers in the Capitol on Tuesday to outline his plan to=20 get the producers running again. He said utilities have had no right to=20 collect money from ratepayers and then not use the funds to repay the small=20 producers. The state has spent billions to buy power from large conventional=20 producers on behalf of the utilities but has refused to pick up the tab for=20 alternative energy. ?????\"The utilities acted in a shameful manner by putting money in their=20 pockets that was designed to pay the [small producers],\" Davis said. ?????The plan outlined by Davis would allow the generators to choose between=20 two rate plans. They could decide to be paid 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour over=20 five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ?????The utilities must begin paying the generators the new rates beginning=20 April 1 or face fines, Davis said. ?????The question of how the companies will get paid the about $1.5 billion=20 they are owed remains unresolved. That issue will be decided in coming weeks=20 as Davis' negotiators continue to work on rescue plans for the state's=20 financially hobbled private utilities. ?????PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the state's largest utility did not take=20 kindly to Davis' criticism, and noted that the governor's plan is similar to=20 a proposal that PG&E made last week to producers. ?????Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of a trade group that includes some=20 of the small generators, described the plan as a positive step. ?????\"The governor got it right in that it's not acceptable for small power=20 producers to continue to generate and not be paid,\" Smutny-Jones said. \"But=20 we'll need to see what the order says; the devil will truly be in the=20 details.\" ?????Grid operators said the state's overall energy situation eased by midday=20 Tuesday because of repairs at the Mohave plant and another large plant at=20 Ormond Beach, and because the Western Area Power Administration came up with=20 300 megawatts of electricity from Glen Canyon Dam. ?????Also, grid spokesman Patrick Dorinson said conservation savings spiked=20 upward after earlier complaints that Californians weren't conserving. ?????\"We saw the people of California probably conserve 900 megawatts today,\"=20 he said. \"That was probably the difference.\" ---=20 ?????Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Jose Cardenas, Marla Dickerson,=20 Noaki Schwartz, Nicholas Riccardi, Doug Smith, Rebecca Trounson and Richard=20 Winton in Los Angeles, Miguel Bustillo and Julie Tamaki in Sacramento, Maria=20 La Ganga in San Francisco, Stanley Allison, Matt Ebnet, Scott Martelle,=20 Dennis McLellan, Monte Morin, Jason Song, Mai Tran and Nancy Wride in Orange=20 County, and Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this story. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- Fragile Supply Network Apt to Fail=20  By JENIFER WARREN and ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writers=20  ?????A lot of people were caught off guard by the blackouts that swept over=20 California this week. Debra Bowen wasn't one of them. ?????As chairwoman of the state Senate Energy Committee, she is=20 intimately--and painfully--familiar with the state's energy supply. And she=20 is willing to share a secret: It's a fragile system, capable of collapse at=20 any time. ?????That knowledge keeps Bowen awake at night, particularly with the=20 approach of summer, when power demand surges as Californians get reacquainted=20 with their air conditioners. ?????\"I sound a bit less like Chicken Little today, don't I?\" Bowen said=20 Tuesday, as chunks of the state once again were forcibly darkened. \"I know a=20 lot of people don't feel we have a problem. But we have a very, very big=20 problem.\" ?????With the recent slowdown in Stage 3 emergencies, a sense of calm had=20 settled over the energy debate, and even some legislators were speaking with=20 guarded optimism about the hot months ahead. ?????On Tuesday, however, a creeping sense of doom was almost palpable among=20 energy watchers, and previous supply forecasts--which predict that the state=20 may yet escape summer blackouts--were being given a second look. ?????\"The outages of the last two days are something that Californians are=20 going to have to get used to for July and August,\" said Michael Zenker,=20 California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The=20 Massachusetts consulting firm is predicting about 20 hours of blackouts this=20 summer. ?????At the California Independent System Operator, which manages 75% of the=20 statewide power grid, officials said the energy cushion the state had in=20 recent weeks was, in some ways, a phantom caused by heavy imports of power. ?????Cal-ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said people may have been deluded=20 into a false state of comfort: \"Maybe there is a tendency to think things=20 have improved,\" he said. In fact, they haven't. ?????More than anything, this week's events illustrate the delicate balance=20 of factors that keep California illuminated, from the multitude of supply=20 sources to the weather. ?????Temperatures were higher than usual. Alternative-energy suppliers--who=20 haven't been paid in months by the cash-strapped utilities--cut their output.=20 Suppliers in the Northwest--which faces a drought--slashed exports. Equipment=20 breakdowns and maintenance at power plants--much of it unanticipated--took=20 13,000 megawatts offline. A utility-run program that gives businesses=20 discounts in exchange for cutting power during emergencies is all but dead. ?????\"The fragility of the system is such that a small perturbation can turn=20 everything upside down very easily,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director=20 of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group of electricity generators and=20 traders. ?????One factor receiving particular attention is the dip in supply caused by=20 unscheduled maintenance. To help officials predict available supply,=20 generators provide an annual maintenance plan that is updated regularly. ?????In addition, however, facilities sometimes shut down for unexpected=20 reasons: leaking tubes, burnt-out transformers, cracked turbines and faulty=20 feed pumps. At one point Tuesday, about 8,200 megawatts were unavailable=20 because of unscheduled shutdowns. That's enough to supply about 6 million=20 households, and up from 5,700 megawatts a week ago. ?????The huge 1,400-megawatt Mohave power plant near Laughlin, Nev., which=20 supplies Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water=20 and Power, was felled Monday by a transformer problem. That was enough to=20 push the state into blackouts. ?????A growing number of skeptics, however, question whether those reasons=20 are always valid, accusing generators of withholding power to shrink supply=20 and drive up prices. ?????\"There's no way to verify it, so you've got to take their word for it,\"=20 said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies California's=20 electricity market. \"And given that it's very profitable for these things to=20 occur, you start to wonder if they're creating an artificial scarcity.\" ?????Tom Williams of Duke Energy said the Houston-based company is working=20 hard to keep its California power plants, which are capable of producing=20 3,351 megawatts of electricity, in operation after months of near-continuous=20 operation. ?????\"It's like riding a moped across the country,\" he said. \"They're just=20 not meant to run this hard.\" ?????Last week, the state Senate formed a committee to investigate charges of=20 market manipulation by power suppliers. The chairman, state Sen. Joe Dunn=20 (D-Santa Ana), says the issue of unscheduled plant shutdowns is on his agenda. ?????\"The problem is: How does one prove that a particular outage was part of=20 a deliberate strategy to deprive the state of kilowatts, rather than a result=20 of normal business operations?\" Dunn said. ---=20 ?????Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this story. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- Elevator Anxiety Is Riding High=20  Emergencies: Workers in skyscrapers worry about blackouts trapping them in=20 their buildings.

What I mean is, we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I can't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F' vs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"  Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not telling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened to the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.

Given no Commission meetings til September, the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do all that much.=0F\"  >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California  @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report  Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the PUC\/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's website. 0F\"... the [PUC\/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13 and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area. 0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consumers to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee 0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $1.2 billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs and\/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specific price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes. 0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well=0F\" have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of peak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order to secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral basis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control area. 0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not now competitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000. 0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC. The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants in the FERC proceedings. 0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability. Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold. Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed.=0F\"  >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California  @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings  If you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their facts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate\/Assembly hearing was like.  It started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to heap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it, and he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story. One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a single-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land with her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment.  Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did not receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He said it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done listening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes.  Yikes!  Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but in neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process?  Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a 6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and air offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC.  The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too hard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC. Sorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact SDG&E rate caps (told you).  The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith. Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in place of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way. The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It takes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high prices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals.  Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were stumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC, today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region? Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and forth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a mob.  For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC.  >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California  @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market  Well, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas & Electric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.  This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.  Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address: 0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential and small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market?) 0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess reasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms? 0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its current customers? 0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and irregularities?  How should state\/federal concerns be addressed? 0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole?  >>> Odds & Ends (_!_)  As promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb Ennis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.

She didn=0F't have to attend the Senate hearing.  Subject: The Brilliance of Women  There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a helicopter.  Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and everyone would die.  No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children and giving in to men.  All of the men started clapping.3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Have a great weekend, y=0F'all [applause]  gba","recipient_ids":[48346],"sender_id":48098,"datetime":965951940,"message_id":255636,"subject":"WPTF Friday Deliver Unto Us A Burrito"}
