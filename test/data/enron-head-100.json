This approval followed on the heels of approval of the Developer's Agreement by the Deerfield Beach City Commission on Thursday, June 14.  Enron Industrial Markets On Friday, June 8 Enron Industrial Markets closed transactions with Huntco Inc. under which EIM will provide inventory management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The EIM project team developed a creative, 15-year structure that enhances Huntco's liquidity, reduces working capital requirements, and hedges their inventory position against directional price risk.    In addition, EIM structured the acquisition of Huntco's cold mill and certain coil pickling operations.  A special purpose vehicle funded by third party equity now owns the assets, which continue to be operated by Huntco under an O&M agreement.  As part of the transaction, EIM purchased a 20-year call option on capacity at the cold mill located in Blytheville, Arkansas.    These transactions with Huntco signal a fundamental change in the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  They give Enron immediate access to physical steel and position Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. Consummation of the Huntco transactions would not have been possible without the contributions of multiple Enron groups who enhanced value to Enron while significantly mitigating risk.

There are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by six dependants.  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.  The total of 40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows:  21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By company, they are broken down as follows:  Enron India -  eight plus three dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.  These figures are likely to continue to trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.  We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the event of danger.  As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon season has started.  A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same resources.  As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable.  We are in the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and offices there.

Vince   -----Original Message----- From: \t\"Frank A. Wolak\" <wolak@zia.Stanford.EDU>@ENRON   Sent:\tFriday, October 19, 2001 4:28 PM To:\tKaminski, Vince J Subject:\t   Vince,    I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this.    First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides.  The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.    However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices.    In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.    As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

I would like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries.  As I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you.  In discussing power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the \"forgotten resource\" in more efficient power markets.  There seems to be a lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many researchers need to address some practical but important problems.  I was asked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by policymakers.  Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major sponsor.  I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron that the company might consider providing $25,000.  As you may appreciate, it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the conference is widely circulated among key government groups.  I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to participate.  I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of providing funding for this effort.

This bank account can only be accessed by any two directors of Enron Servicios signing jointly (this is my suggestion and can obviously be different).  3 - Our lawyers in Mexico will open the account and funds will be transferred forthwith.  4 - The resolution and the bank account will not be public record and no employee should know about these funds (we need to see how we can send funds to this bank account  without any Mexico employee's signature)  Purpose:  (i) Document our legal obligations in accordance with mexican law and the reason why the shareholders of the company wish to segregate funds and (ii) make sure nobody besides the directors can access these funds.

Such distributions are of particular importance in  applications because of the prevalence of models based on  scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able  to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is  coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through  linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale  calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical  efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several  case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index  tracking.   Keywords: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean  shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios,  hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management   JEL Classification: G0 ______________________________  John D.

The July contract lost $0.074 to $4.038 per MMBtu, trading most of the session above the $4.00 support level as warm weather in the Northeast kept demand firm. August dipped $0.088 to $4.123 per MMBtu. Local and short-term traders' early efforts to push prices lower were successful, but some see the risk\/reward of additional selling at these levels limited. On Wednesday, the AGA reported a storage inventory build of 105 Bcf from the previous week, well above both the 2000 injection of 78 Bcf and the 5-year average of 81 Bcf for the comparable weeks. The selling sparked by the AGA number was encouraged by some disappointment with weather conditions in the Northeast. Earlier this week, some forecasters were calling for warmer temperatures, with some cities expected to be near 90 degrees. But temperatures in the region have been in the low to mid-80s. However, warmer weather is expected to continue in the East though this weekend. Mild weather will linger in the north-central and northwestern states. California and the western states will begin to heat up this weekend and early next week. Further tests of $4.00 are likely, with significant support at $3.80. Resistance is seen at $4.20. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.15  $0.25 yesterday, except out west, where the Topock delivery point tumbled over $1.00. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.16 to $3.97 per MMBtu. __________________________________________________ North American Gas Storage Conference=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09 Storage 2001 - 2002:=09=09=09 Source of Stability or Chaos?=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09 June 22, Houston=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09 Find the answers at Ziff Energy's natural gas storage conference.

Speaking at an energy conference in Halifax, he pleaded with the federal government to let the province keep more of the royalties. A 1986 offshore deal between Canada and Nova Scotia names the province as the main beneficiary of offshore oil and natural gas royalties, but the actual revenue split gives Ottawa 81% and Nova Scotia 19%. Nova Scotia already exports natural gas to New England from the Sable Offshore Energy Project.

The plan would fall short of the price caps. But, expanding the existing formula for price limits has picked up support among Republicans who are under increasing pressure. FERC Chairman Hebert has called a special commission hearing for Monday to address the continuing issues affecting California and the West. The proposal seeks to have FERC set target prices for wholesale electricity prices on an around-the-clock basis for the entire West. Under the existing plan, the FERC price limits are triggered when the state declares a power emergency and are based on the amount that generators can charge to produce power at the least efficient plant. Hebert says that since the FERC relief plan went into effect on May 29th, power prices in California have dropped to under $100 per MWh from earlier in May over the $300 per MWh. The day-ahead market in California recently traded about $45 per MWh.=20 _______________________________________________ ENERGY. @ENERGY, FEA's Complete Suite of Energy Products, BUILT FOR THE FUTURE. *Manage all your energy risks. *Build and Price deals. *Value physical assets (generation, storage, etc.) *Report and reduce your energy risks FEA FINANCIAL ENGINEERING ASSOCIATEShttp:\/\/www.fea.com=20 main phone number:  1 510-548-6200 email address: info@fea.com=20 ______________________________________________  Williams to Supply California Ethanol  Williams Bio-Energy has agreed to supply ethanol to California by the fourth quarter of this year. Earlier this week, the EPA denied California's request to waive provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act requiring the use of additives to make cleaner-burning gasoline. The decision means California will need about 580 million gallons of ethanol for RFG oxygenates in 2004, because the state banned MTBE by the end of 2002. Williams will house 15,000 barrels of ethanol at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners storage facility in Carson, California, to supply the Los Angeles and San Diego markets. Williams plans transport ethanol to the storage facility and directly to refiners by large unit rail shipments and ocean vessels. =20 ______________________________________________ National Energy Services Association Email: william.harper@nesanet.org http:\/\/www.nesanet.org=20 713\/856-6525 _________________________________________________  Mitchell Reports Higher Proven Reserves      Mitchell Energy & Development reports its proven reserves are up 38% in the first half of the year. Mitchells proved reserves have increased by 580 Bcfe, putting its total reserves at 2.1 Tcfe. The single biggest increase, 210 Bcfe, came from its most successful field, the Barnett Shale play in North Texas. The new reserves came from step-out drilling; drilling which occurs outside the previously confirmed area in the Barnett Shale, the fourth-largest producing field in Texas. Mitchell currently holds 230,000 acres of the Barnett and has drilled the area for almost 50 years.=20 ________________________________________________  SUNGARD  Solutions for Success in Energy Trading  Epsilon and Panorama Energy Risk and complexity are inevitable components of every trading transaction within today's volatile energy market.

A more efficient and more competitive regulatory standard is required. The Mexican regulatory commission for energy, the CRE has not changed the reference for prices which remains southern Texas. The federal commission for regulatory improvements has a week to decide whether to accept the CRE's proposals. Mexico will require private sector investment of $114 Billion by 2009 in the sector. The companies want to see a new standard established before the end of the year and all are thinking about pulling out if laws are not clear and in place. The CRE wants to adjust maximum prices only when the private companies have completed five years of Mexican operations, something which will occur in most cases next year.

The panel voted along party lines to defeat a bill to force FERC to cap wholesale electricity prices in the West. Democrats tried to stick the measure in a $6.5 billion spending bill that was intended mainly to fill out immediate defense needs this fiscal year. Rejecting the price caps amendment, Republicans argued it would not solve California's problems of tight supplies, but would further distort the marketplace. House Republican Whip DeLay of Texas said California's power crisis is the result of allowing environmental extremists to run the state government. Saying the federal government should not intervene in California's electricity market, Rep. Callahan of Alabama, who chairs the House Appropriations Energy and Water subcommittee, said: I respectfully submit to you that you've made your own bed. Democrats countered that limiting prices to cover production costs and a reasonable profit was essential to halt price gouging by unscrupulous suppliers. Democrats hoped to persuade a few West Coast Republicans to support the price caps, but those on the committee resisted. Under the existing plan, the FERC price limits are triggered when the state declares a power emergency and are based on the amount that generators can charge to produce power at the least efficient plant. Generators can charge more if it can be justified.=20 ______________________________________________ TRENTON\/BLACKRIVER \"BOOM\" IN WEST VIRGINIA Land and Mineral Development LLC., Vienna, West Virginia, owns 85,000 acres of mineral rights in Southeastern West Virginia.

Dominion would be responsible for the construction, ownership and operation of the proposed facility, which will utilize state-of-the-art clean coal technology and would burn more than 65% coal waste. Anker would provide all of the facility's fuel from on-site surface mining operations. This proposed coal-fired plant is the first Dominion has developed since payingt $1.2 billion to the EPA last November for Clean Air Act violations pertaining to its coal-fired facilities. The proposed facility will be developed with NOx reducing equipment built-in. Also, the plant will utilize circulating fluidized bed boilers, technology that allows coal to be burned more efficiently. The CFB boilers can also burn low heat-content coal and waste fuel, something traditional burners cannot. All coal and coal waste produced will be burned on-site. Limestone will be used to react with sulfur in the coal to lower SO2 emissions.=20 ____________________________________________________ EnerfactsDaily Job Center at http:\/\/enernetenergy.com 45 New Job Postings Including: * Financial Trader * Risk Trader * Energy Accounts * Sourcing Manager _____________________________________________________  APGA Believes Market Manipulated=20  Unsatisfied by the federal government's explanation that the high gas prices last winter were due mainly to supply and demand, the American Public Gas Association says it believes the recent price drop is a signal that the market may have been unfairly manipulated. In a letter sent to the EIA and to key lawmakers, APGA insists that the supply\/demand explanations do not tell the full story. Rather, the association of municipal gas systems believes price speculation played a major role in the dramatic upswing in prices during the 2000-2001 heating season. Citing FERC's investigation into gas prices at the California border, APGA said it is concerned not only about that point, but also that market power gained through the unregulated control of pipeline capacity will lead to unjust and unreasonable prices for natural gas service throughout the US. APGA says it is convinced that the true cause of record prices for gas will not be known unless the role played by energy traders and price speculators is examined.=20 _____________________________________________________  Need a past issue of Enerfax Daily or Enerfax GOLD.

Admit it: The only  comic relief in this energy crisis has been watching our leaders go at  suppliers and each other like pro wrestlers or Jerry Springer guests.        In his State of the State address last  January, Gov. Gray Davis accused the big private electric power generators  of legalized highway robbery and threatened to seize their plants if  necessary. Then he really got angry, calling them \"the biggest snakes in  the world.\" This past week, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer boosted the rhetoric a  notch by declaring he would like to personally escort the chairman of  Enron Corp. \"to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude  who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.\"' Meanwhile, President Bush and  Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed California for causing its own  problems with a \"harebrained\" deregulation scheme and mocked the state's  power purchases and conservation programs. It's been fun. Now it's time  for our leaders to act like adults.        Davis and Bush always will have their  political differences, but the economies of both the state and the nation  are endangered by California's energy situation. These leaders need to  work together as cooperatively as possible, starting next week when Bush  makes his first visit to California as president.        Davis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to  meet with him during his California visit. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer  said the president looks forward to discussing energy and other issues.  Good start. Let's hope the conversation is civil and that the civility  spreads.       No matter how much California  has been abused by the power companies, and it absolutely has, the state  still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric  power generation this year and next. Usually, the biggest targets of  official and public wrath are the investor-owned utilities such as  Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. But not this  time because, in the view of the state, the utilities have been bled dry  by the power generators' stratospheric prices. The state had to take over  the purchase of power when the generators refused to extend any more  credit to Edison and PG&E. Legal recourse should be pursued, but the  threatening rhetoric needs to subside.        State lawmakers are right to be upset  with the White House for refusing to use its authority to set reasonable  temporary wholesale price controls. And Davis is justifiably upset with  Bush and with Cheney, who said the only solution was to build more power  plants--ignoring the fact that the state is building 10 plants now, with  five more on the way, and that the only way to control wholesale power  rates is for Washington to cap them.       If  the state hadn't bought the power, the generators would have let the  lights go out. Davis needs to deliver that message, quietly and  persuasively, while Bush is in California. And Bush needs to listen  respectfully, like an adult.   Search the archives  of the Los  Angeles Times for similar stories.

He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried \"Wolf!\" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims.   But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state - and nobody will believe it.   True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators.   But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market, and that the actions of generators \"gaming the system\" have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently - and very profitably - short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity.   As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that \"generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market\" - a view shared by a growing number of other researchers.   Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say \"apparently\" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey - the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls - voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual.   What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not.   Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls \"megawatt laundering\" - selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to \"imports\" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: \"I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient.\"   The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there - indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them.   The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it, that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan \"a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout\" from the looming disaster.   Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.  http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/04\/29\/opinion\/29KRUG.html?ex=989601563&ei=1&en=6a900f004b3b1abf  \/-----------------------------------------------------------------\\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

Subject:\tBingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas   Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard.  We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates.  On transparency, Leon understands our concerns.  In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.  Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).  Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under \"information required\" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:  (2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.  The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.  As to the \"timely basis\" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:  \"(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.  The change is to add \"appropriate\" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of \"appropriate\" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like \"consistent with ...\" or \"promote competition\" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.  Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.  Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.","datetime":1000273313,"message_id":62815,"recipient_ids":[293],"sender_id":1482,"subject":"FW: Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas","hashtags":["aaaa","bbbb"]},{"body":"Shirley,  Approved.

In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

Let me explain \twhy.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk \tmore about this.  \t  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing \tand specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM \timplements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility \tand reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the \tPJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a \t%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems \tis out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact \tthat a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) \tThen the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting \tsoftware to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat \tunfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the \tPJM ISO decides what prices it would like \tfor a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not \ta transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy \tthe risk management services that Enron provides.  The \tonly price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is \tthat kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area \tto meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the \timports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.  \t  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the \tEast Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports \tto the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at \tthe discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service \tmitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. \tIt effectively kills off the development of risk management at \tthe wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less \tprofitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated \tprices.  \t  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative \tform of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces \tprice volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just \tget a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service \tregulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service \tmitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service \tprices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.  \t  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources \tof benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side \tinvolved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A \tnecessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect \tactual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power \texercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market \tparticipants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM \tmodel is just way to have a market in name without achieving any \tsignificant benefits to consumers or energy traders.  \tFrank","datetime":1003499763,"message_id":54531,"recipient_ids":[29461],"sender_id":1654,"subject":"Fw: Comments of Wolak","hashtags":["aaaa","bbbb"]},{"body":"   -----Original Message----- From: \tKoepke, Gwyn   Sent:\tTuesday, June 26, 2001 12:28 AM To:\tKaminski, Vince J Subject:\tFW: Venezuela FX and inflation forecasts, June 2001  Vince,  FYI,  Gwyn   -----Original Message----- From: \tKoepke, Gwyn   Sent:\tWednesday, June 20, 2001 3:13 PM To:\tHudler, Cindy Cc:\tShahi, Pushkar; Stuart III, William; Raymond, Maureen Subject:\tVenezuela FX and inflation forecasts, June 2001  Cindy,  Please find attached the FX and CPI forecasts for Venezuela.

Enron's Skilling gets pied before his speech blaming lawmakers, but says he understands Californians' anger  By Rick Jurgens TIMES STAFF WRITER    SAN FRANCISCO -- A Texas energy executive who said his warnings were ignored by regulators who restructured California's electricity industry came to the Bay Area on Thursday to say, in effect, \"I told you so.\"  Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., said that California wouldn't be in its current mess if regulators had followed his advice in 1994 and 1995.  Regulators erred by forcing wholesale electricity transactions into the spot market so that deals could more easily be monitored, Skilling said in a speech to about 100 people at the Commonwealth Club of California. \"They created a flawed marketplace in the name of regulatory expediency.\"  Enron is a broker that buys and sells contracts to deliver power. Such bilateral transactions shouldn't have been banned, Skilling said.  Skilling said that's what he said six years ago.  \"I probably made a pest of myself (in the restructuring hearings called by regulators) because I told them they were doing it wrong,\" he said. \"They finally told me to keep quiet.\"  On Thursday night, it was Skilling's turn to be pestered. A woman threw a chocolate pie into his face before the event began. Police said Francine Cavanaugh of Oakland was arrested on suspicion of battery and released.  Skilling tried to ignore protesters but said he understood why Californians, facing blackouts and rising power costs, were angry. He even had kind words for Gov. Gray Davis, who, he said, \"was dealt a very difficult hand.\"  Skilling became Enron's chief executive in February, replacing company founder Kenneth Lay, an early proponent of electricity deregulation who is close to President Bush.  Enron, a global energy giant with roots in the natural gas industry, owns some power plants, but its influence in the electricity industry reflects the rapid growth of its energy trading operation.  Enron's only California generators are small wind facilities. However, the company has developed power plants. Enron initiated two 750-megawatt projects that were sold to Calpine Corp., including a Pittsburg plant due to go online next month. Enron has announced plans to seek regulators' approval for a 750-megawatt power plant in Roseville in Placer County.  During the first three months of 2001, Enron posted a huge jump in revenue, to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion a year ago, but a much smaller gain in net income, to $425 million from $338 million. Skilling himself cashed an $850,000 paycheck and got a $5.6 million bonus last year.  But the energy crisis has taken its toll on Enron's stock price and on Skilling, who owned or held options to buy 1.9 million shares of Enron common stock at the time of the company's February proxy filing. At Thursday's closing price of $44.05 a share, the stock was down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high of $90.75 in August.  That proved that Enron wasn't the villain in California, Skilling said. \"This thing in California has been bad for everybody,\" he said. \"If we had anything to do with this, we're the stupidest people in the world.\"     ___________________________________ Contact Information E-mail kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net  Phone (213) 926-2626 Fax (707) 516-0019 Traditional Mail PO Box 21074 ?Los Angeles, CA 90021 ___________________________________  ","datetime":993191794,"message_id":9175,"recipient_ids":[4058],"sender_id":5827,"subject":"Texas energy exec says, 'I told you'","hashtags":["aaaa","bbbb"]},{"body":"Thanks Vince - I'll give him a try.  -----Original Message----- From: Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com [mailto:Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com] Sent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 10:03 PM To: pannesley@riskwaters.com Subject: RE: Risk 2001 Australia   Philip,  Please, try Frank Wolak from Stanford University.

According to a number of computer security types, a purported video of the McVeigh execution circulating the 'Net is actually a virus that drops the SubSeven backdoor onto infected systems.  For those who don't know, SubSeven can be used to take over control of the infected machine and be used in distributed denial-of-service attacks. The good news is that most updated antivirus scanners already detect this virus, so if your systems are up to date, you should be safe.  For more on this, check out this wire story posted on DigitalMass.com: http:\/\/digitalmass.boston.com\/news\/2001\/06\/14\/mcveigh_virus.html   Today's bug patches and security alerts:   * SQL security hole lets attackers take over  A security flaw in Microsoft's SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server 2000 Gold can allow an attacker to take control of a targeted server, the company said in a security bulletin late Tuesday night. Microsoft issued a patch for the flaw at the same time it released the bulletin. http:\/\/www.nwfusion.com\/news\/2001\/0613sqlhole.html IDG News Service, 06\/13\/01  For a patch and more information from Microsoft: http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/technet\/security\/bulletin\/MS01-032.asp   * Microsoft has third go at Exchange hole  Microsoft has issued a third version of a patch intended to plug a security hole that could allow hackers access to mailboxes on Exchange Server Versions 5.5 and 2000. The second patch contained outdated files, Microsoft said in an updated security bulletin issued Wednesday. http:\/\/www.nwfusion.com\/news\/2001\/0614exchangehole.html IDG News Service, 06\/14\/01  For a third try at getting the correct patch, click to: http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/technet\/security\/bulletin\/MS01-030.asp   * HP warns of potential DoS vulnerability in kmmodreg  Hewlett-Packard is warning its HP-UX operating system users of a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in the kmmodreg command, which is executed each time the system is booted. The problem with the package also could be used to increase privileges on the affected system. HP-UX users can download a patch for the kmmodreg problem by logging on to HP's IT Resource Center at: http:\/\/itrc.hp.com   * Xinetd patch released by Linux OS vendors  Many Linux vendors have released a patch for the xinetd package that fixes a flaw in the way the application deals with TCP WAIT commands. The problem prevents the linuxconf-web application from working properly. Another flaw in the xinetd package creates world-writeable files that can be used in a symlink attack. Linux-Mandrake users can download the new patch from: http:\/\/www.linux-mandrake.com\/en\/ftp.php3  Red Hat users can get more information and links to patches from: http:\/\/www.redhat.com\/support\/errata\/RHSA-2001-075.html  Immunix OS 7.0-beta and 7.0 users can get the appropriate patch from: http:\/\/download.immunix.org\/ImmunixOS\/7.0\/updates\/RPMS\/xinetd-2.1.8.9pre15-2  _imnx.i386.rpm   * Linux-Mandrake patches tcpdump  Linux-Mandrake has issued a patch for its tcpdump package that fixes a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The flaw could be used in a remote attack on the tcpdump process. This patch also fixes a previous vulnerability that could allow a remote user to run arbitrary code on the affected system without root privileges. The new patch can be downloaded from: http:\/\/www.linux-mandrake.com\/en\/ftp.php3   * Linux-Mandrake fixes imap flaw  According to an alert from Linux-Mandrake, several flaws have been found in the UW-IMAP package that could allow an authenticated user to gain greater shell command access. This is particularly problematic for e-mail systems that do not normally provide shell access. Patches can be downloaded from: http:\/\/www.linux-mandrake.com\/en\/ftp.php3   * Conectiva patches exim  A printf vulnerability exists in exim, a mail transfer utility. The flaw in the code deals with the way exim check e-mail headers without protecting against a printf format attack. Conectiva users can download the appropriate patch from: ftp:\/\/atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br\/6.0\/SRPMS\/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.src.rpm ftp:\/\/atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br\/6.0\/RPMS\/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm ftp:\/\/atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br\/6.0\/RPMS\/exim-doc-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm  ftp:\/\/atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br\/6.0\/RPMS\/exim-mon-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm    * Red Hat issues patch for ispell  According to an alert from Red Hat, the ispell program uses mktemp() to open temporary files, which makes it vulnerable to symlink attacks. For more information and to download a patch: http:\/\/www.redhat.com\/support\/errata\/RHSA-2001-074.html   * GnuPG patch available for Red Hat Linux users  GnuPG, an open source version of PGP, contains a number of flaws that could leave a user's private key exposed.

For more information and links to the appropriate download: http:\/\/www.redhat.com\/support\/errata\/RHSA-2001-073.html   * Red Hat: LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership  According to an alert from Red Hat, LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership at init time, though it does properly setuid and setgid. The result is that LPRng, and its children, maintain any supplemental groups that the process starting LPRng had at the time it started LPRng. This is a security risk. Download the appropriate patch from:  Red Hat Linux 7.0: alpha: ftp:\/\/updates.redhat.com\/7.0\/en\/os\/alpha\/LPRng-3.7.4-23.alpha.rpm i386: ftp:\/\/updates.redhat.com\/7.0\/en\/os\/i386\/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm  Red Hat Linux 7.1: i386: ftp:\/\/updates.redhat.com\/7.1\/en\/os\/i386\/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm   * ScreamingMedia patches SiteWare vulnerability  A flaw in ScreamingMedia's SiteWare Web server could allow a user to view all documents in the SiteWare Web hierarchy. A similar problem could allow any file to be retrieved from the system.

And though, technically, there still may not be very many viruses for the Mac, a new Mac e-mail worm has recently been discovered and is making its way across iMacs and Powerbooks everywhere. http:\/\/www.nwfusion.com\/news\/2001\/0611simpsons.html IDG News Service, 06\/11\/01   * Virus hoax warns people to delete AOL  Perhaps the greatest thrill for any prankster is to have his hoax taken as truth. Just such a thing has happened to Ray Owens, who runs a Web site called Joke A Day. Owens sent an e- mail to the 342,000 of his subscribers on June 5 (after an initial mailing on June 2 to another list) warning them of a new virus, called AOL.EXE. Warning your customers of a virus seems like a nice thing to do, except that AOL.EXE isn't a virus at all; it's the AOL application that provides Internet access to millions of people worldwide. http:\/\/www.nwfusion.com\/net.worker\/news\/2001\/0611aolhoax.html IDG News Service, 06\/11\/01  * WM97\/Myna-AR - A Word macro virus with no malicious payload.

Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim). Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just \"passthroughs\" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).","datetime":986832720,"message_id":62637,"recipient_ids":[3441,4058,1477,701,293,1544],"sender_id":1490,"subject":"Call to Bob Glynn","hashtags":["aaaa","bbbb"]},{"body":" Jeff   Candidly, this wouldn't have been my approach  (posh location, closed format, odd group, seemingly self-serving agenda).     I read the article below  as unsympatheticand almost  mocking in its tonetoward Enron.  It's  noteworthy theBeverly Hills meeting was not covered in the Los Angeles  papers.  Instead, this article comes fromthe front page of the Bay Area's San Francisco Chronicle (Democratic bastion and  home to both of California's United States Senators, power broker Willie Brown,  Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the state's public utility commission).     Consistent with myconcern about a \"coast-to-coast  firestorm\"engulfing Enron, the New York  Times ran two articles today that were  unsupportiveof the  company.   q        Senator Calls  for Hearings Into Energy Regulators' Moves By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS Senator  Dianne Feinstein called for hearings into possible improprieties between members  of the F.E.R.C. and private energy interests.   q        Enron's  Dispute With Utility in India Grows More Tangled By SARITHA RAI The  dispute between the Enron Corporation and Indian federal and state government  officials keeps getting messier.   These follow the Times'  tough piece on Ken Lay yesterday.   Undoubtedly, the Washington Post will have to get into fray  soon.   My feeling is that just as  with the \"business\" side, Enron's public policy strategy needs be well informed,  sophisticated and comprehensive.  I  fear that anything less will fuel the potential of undesirable outcomes for  Enron's reputation, leadership and shareholdervalue.   Kevin 213-926-2626   PS - May I have a copy  of the position paper that was circulated in the Beverly Hills  meeting.   The Gate         www.sfgate.com          Return  to regular view   Enron's secret bid to save deregulation  PRIVATE  MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians  Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur,  Chronicle Staff Writers  Saturday, May 26, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle    URL: http:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/cgi-bin\/article.cgi?file=\/c\/a\/2001\/05\/26\/MN209410.DTL    Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly courted  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other luminaries  this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to California's  energy crisis.   His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and  federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.   Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign  contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at the  Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.   Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham  Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990  and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star  Schwarzenegger;   and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been  courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.   One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified,  said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support  Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the  state's energy mess.   PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is  concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power  markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government authority  to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create  and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and run power plants in  California.   \"They're trying to rescue deregulation,\" the source said of Enron  executives. \"They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea.\"   At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position paper  titled \"Comprehensive Solution for California,\" which was obtained by The  Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in  debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that investigations of power  price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse.   The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway  electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power  generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by  regulators and economists.   One of the talking points read: \"Get deregulation right this time --  California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers.\" Another  point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity.   INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and  was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a  competitive power market system.   Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially  produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from  generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this year,  Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.   Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for  Enron, said she would \"look into that\" and then did not return repeated  telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at the  meeting.   D.C. CONNECTIONS Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached  unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times, Lay  supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating  the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story also said Lay  essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not support Lay's desire  to further deregulate the nation's electricity system. Lay denied the  allegation.   Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief  executive of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of  Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant  Amgen.   Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles  Lakers star Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton  supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's  first civilian space trip.   Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but  declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment  through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon.   A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor  attended,   but was \"not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this  issue.   His intent is to listen to all sides.\"   Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to  Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support  Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source who  participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and  asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his agenda.

CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S.     In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific   Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather   derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of   megawatt hours (MWh) sold.    The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of   how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not   want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether   to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or   derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may   be used as an introduction to options.    The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and   deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW.   Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability   distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability   distribution for the net operating contribution including the   contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives.   It is instructive for the students to think about what would be   the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent.   This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio.    Specific learning objectives of these cases include these:    - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial     innovation    - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk    - to challenge the students to value options where the     Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be     readily employed    - to experience the perspective of top management in risk     management activities.

It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer  comments a couple days ago.  Today, it has the NY Times article on Ken  Lay.  It's pretty clear that in the near-term, Enron and it's  leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm  which bounces from coast to coast, gaining strength each step of the  way.     However, it  is the long-term challenge that draws my attention.  From my research  to date, I am left with the strong impression that the Enron's capacity  for acquiring, distilling and assessing business information is much  stronger than it's abilities with public policy information.     Ken Lay,  you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial  company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge.  Like  Goldman Sachs, it is hard for the \"man on the street\" to understand  precisely what Enron does.  However, because of your presence in  businesses that play out daily in homes, schools and small  businesses, Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldn't imagine  in it's worst nightmares.   From my  perspective, the success of Enron's business model demands a sure  footing in both business and public policy.  Going  forward, these two areas of expertise need  become intertwined to assure the success of the highly  sophisticated, ethical, innovative and insightful global corporation  known as Enron.   I would like  to help you succeed with this challenge.  I look forward to our  discussions.   Kevin 213-926-2626      Advertisers make  this site possible.

Now they must decide  whether those companies have done anything illegal. State Attorney General Bill  Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence ``strongly suggests'' power  companies acted illegally to drive up prices. He has said that he would love to  put top energy executives in jail. Brandon  Bailey and Chris O'Brien in the San Jose  Mercury  -- 5\/25\/01  Davis blackout warnings -- a significant policy change aimed  at minimizing business and consumer disruptions, Gov. Gray Davis ordered state  officials Thursday to enact a three-tier blackout warning system. Forecasts of  blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand, Davis said. General areas will be  identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations  will be announced an hour before the power is cut, he said. Dan Morain and Nancy  Vogel in the Los Angeles  Times  Greg Lucas and Lynda Gledhill in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Noam Levey and  Dion Nissenbaum in the San Jose  Mercury  John Hill in the Sacramento  Bee  Ed Mendel in the San  Diego Union  Robert Garrett in the Riverside  Press  Michael Coit in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5\/25\/01  Davis' popularity plunges in poll -- With California's energy crisis  mounting, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job  approval rating and image among state residents, according to a Field Poll  released yesterday. For the first time since his November 1998 election, more  Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis' performance than favorable.  Carla Marinucci in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Hallye Jordan in the  San Jose  Mercury  John Marelius in the San  Diego Union  -- 5\/25\/01  Poll puts Riordan, Davis in tight race -- Californians' assessment of Gov.  Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state  energy crisis, placing outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in a virtual  dead heat with him for the 2002 governor's race, according to a Field Poll  released Thursday. Though Riordan has given no clear indication that he intends  to run for governor, 42 percent of registered voters said they would support the  Republican mayor should he challenge Davis, the Democratic incumbent.  Forty-three percent said they would vote for Davis. Emily  Bazar in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5\/25\/01  California to gain from GOP's loss -- A single party switch in the Senate  on Thursday handed California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara  Boxer new clout with key leadership roles likely on issues ranging from military  base closings to environmental cleanups. Vermont Sen. James Jeffords'  announcement that he was quitting the Republican Party to be an independent  affiliated with Democrats set up a takeover in which the Democrats, with a de  facto 51-49 majority, will assume all Senate leadership posts and committee  chairs. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5\/25\/01  PUC and 'baseline' rates -- Nine days after structuring the  largest electricity rate increase in California history, state regulators on  Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine  how much each residential customer will pay. If the indicators are revised  upward, as most expect, that would grant some customers relief from the rate  hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power  purchases. Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles  Times  Michael Bazeley in the San Jose  Mercury  Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5\/25\/01  Enron Bush  -- Curtis H?bert Jr., Washington's top electricity regulator, said he had barely  settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone  conversation with Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the nation's largest electricity  trader, the Enron Corporation. Mr. H?bert, chairman of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, said that Mr. Lay, a close friend of President Bush's,  offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation, Enron  would continue to support him in his new job. Lowell  Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times   -- 5\/25\/01  Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in  depths of poll --  The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in the  dumper was quick and blunt. \"Tell me something I don't already know,\" adviser  Paul Maslin said after being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed  Davis' job rating down 18 points since January. \"None of this is news to us,\"  Maslin said. Matier & Ross in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5\/25\/01  Water and power -- The California Public Utilities Commission authorized an increase in  American States Water Co.'s rates at the Bear Valley Electric customer service  area of its Southern California Water Co. unit to recover $2.4 million in  deferred electric power costs. The amount will be recovered from customers over  a five-year period. Sam Favate; Dow  Jones Newswires  -- 5\/25\/01  Muni power  -- Gov. Davis said he received a pledge Thursday from municipal utility  officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much  lower than in the past. Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their  customers to rolling blackouts, the muni officials promised Davis they will keep  cooperating with the state. Municipal utility customers, including those in the  Modesto, Turlock and Merced irrigation districts, will continue to face power  blackouts, officials said afterward. Jim  Miller in the Modesto Bee   -- 5\/25\/01  Edison merit raises -- Southern California Edison, which  is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy, will hand out $19 million in merit  raises to its 12,000 employees today, but top executives will forgo the raises  because of the company's financial woes. Edison has doled out hefty merit raises  in the past. But this year, the company will pay the minimum under its variable  compensation program, which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals.  Kate Berry in the Orange County  Register  -- 5\/25\/01 Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts -- More than 15 California cities  that have municipal utilities, including Anaheim, are asking federal regulators  to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the state's Independent  System Operator. The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in  California's rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas. Vernon's utility  argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had  enough power to keep the lights on. Amy Strahan  Butler in the Orange County  Register  -- 5\/25\/01  Utility tax windfall -- As electricity rates rise,  consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill  tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years. A member  of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls  from the utility user tax, and he is backing a grass-roots movement to slash or  repeal it. Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money, saying that  they need it to pay their own higher energy bills. Wendy  Thermos in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5\/25\/01  An air of discontent over diesel backups -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday  that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage 3  electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts. And when blackouts do occur,  thousands of tractor-trailer-size generators will whir to life, powering  elevators and lights, hospital equipment, even assembly lines. But that prospect  has created major concerns. Most of those industrial- strength generators run on  diesel oil, a highly polluting fuel. Because they were intended for emergency  use, generators have escaped most environmental regulations. What's more, they  are likely to be called into service on the hottest, smoggiest days of the year.  Carolyn Said in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5\/25\/01  Power price controls -- The House Energy and Commerce  Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans  and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price  controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast. The negotiations  hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans' staunch opposition to  price controls. An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned  contentious and was defeated on a mostly partisan vote in subcommittee. Les Blumenthal in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5\/25\/01  For seniors, the heat can kill, doctors warn -- As summer slouches toward  Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity, doctors and  advocates for the elderly are sounding a counter-theme. Heat can kill. And most  often, it kills seniors. Year after year, heat waves around the United States  are deadlier than hurricanes or floods, tornadoes or earthquakes, according to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver  Teichert in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5\/25\/01  Outages could be fatal for disabled -- Around the clock, an electric  pump supplies supplementary oxygen to 66-year-old Benny Pritchett's diseased  lungs. Pritchett worries that a rolling blackout might kill him. \"The  electricity goes out, I'm a dead man,\" said the San Bernardino apartment dweller  and former chain-smoker. \"I've got a (back-up) oxygen tank. It lasts two hours.  When it runs out, I'm dead.\" Rolling blackouts aren't expected to last much more  than an hour, say Southern California Edison officials, but their Web site  recommends that any customer dependent on electrically operated life-support  equipment buy an emergency generator. Richard  Brooks in the Riverside  Press  -- 5\/25\/01  Gasoline prices -- Average gasoline prices statewide are nearly $2 a gallon, and the Los  Angeles region has once again been dubbed the nation's hub of traffic  congestion. So, what's a good Southern Californian to do? Plan a road trip.  Hugo Martin in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5\/25\/01  Offshore drilling -- A federal advisory panel Thursday urged the Bush administration to  identify the five most promising areas to drill for natural gas in coastal  waters off California and other states, which have been off limits to drilling  for nearly 20 years. Citing the nation's unmet energy needs, the advisory group  to Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton suggested that locating the top reservoirs  of natural gas would help determine if there \"are grounds and support for a  limited lifting of\" moratoriums on offshore drilling. The ban now covers 610  million acres of ocean off the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Kenneth Weiss in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5\/25\/01  Judge demands straight answers from El Paso Corp. -- An irate judge threatened  yesterday to subpoena the president of a Texas energy firm accused of  manipulating California natural gas prices, saying he couldn't get straight  answers out of another high-ranking company executive. The eruption by Curtis  Wagner Jr., the administrative law judge presiding over a federal probe of  alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp., prompted the company to schedule  voluntary testimony by President William Wise today in Washington, D.C. Bernadette Tansey in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5\/25\/01  El Paso executive and collusion -- The head of a Texas energy  conglomerate personally endorsed a deal between two subsidiaries accused of  manipulating the natural gas market in Southern California to drive up prices, a  senior official of the firm testified Thursday. The testimony in a trial-like  hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about  whether top officials of Houston-based El Paso Corp. violated FERC rules  requiring arm's-length dealings within a corporate family. The admission by El  Paso executive Ralph Eads marked a shift from his previous testimony and was  elicited through sharp questioning by an angry judge who threatened to subpoena  Eads' boss. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5\/25\/01  Riverside no blackouts -- Southern California Edison won't  immediately challenge Riverside's decision against using rolling blackouts to  save energy this summer, a spokesman said Thursday. Edison doesn't care how the  city of Riverside curtails its energy use as long as the city makes the required  cuts during a statewide power shortage, Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said.  Dan Lee in the Riverside  Press  -- 5\/25\/01  Energy crisis hits muni bonds -- Investors fled the California  municipal bond market last month, taking with them a net $3.5 billion, their  departure prompted in part by the state's energy crisis and taxes, a fund  analysis firm said Thursday. The withdrawals in April marked the worst such  outflow in years, and it comes as the state is preparing this August to issue a  record $13.4 billion in bonds to bail out utilities. Loretta Kalb in the Sacramento Bee   -- 5\/25\/01  With a perfectly negative crisis record, Davis desperate for a  win -- So far, Gov. Gray Davis has amassed an unblemished record in  his handling of the energy crisis. Not one major aspect of the situation has  moved in the positive direction Davis said -- and clearly hoped -- it would, to  wit: Dan Walters in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5\/25\/01  Hot days don't cut the power -- A combination of factors kept the  state's beleaguered system out of the red this time. The heat wave didn't hit  all areas of the state at the same time, and cooler weather in the Pacific  Northwest got power flowing from that region to California again. Also, there  have been no new power-plant malfunctions, and many of the smaller generating  facilities that were AWOL a few weeks ago, when the last blackouts hit, are  operating again. A huge potential contributor to blackout avoidance -- but one  that's difficult to quantify -- is conservation. Jack  Katzanek in the Riverside  Press  -- 5\/25\/01  Long Beach Boeing layoffs -- Reflecting a sagging market for  100-seat jetliners, the Boeing Co. will lay off about 600 employees this year at  its commercial factory in Long Beach, the company confirmed Thursday. That  decision followed an internal study by Boeing that was completed earlier this  year, said spokesman Warren Lamb, who did not elaborate. Ian Hanigan in the Long Beach Press  --  5\/25\/01  Hahn --  His job is to both prosecute and defend. And with that tricky mandate, Los  Angeles City Atty. James Kenneth Hahn for 16 years has led a law office that, in  sheer numbers, would rank among the biggest in the country. With some 450  attorneys, responsibility for both criminal and civil cases, and an annual  budget of $70 million, the office, like the city it serves, is big, diverse,  complex. But a review of Hahn's record suggests that his performance has been  mixed--deliberate and plodding, pragmatic and obstinate. Greg Krikorian and Patrick  McGreevey in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5\/25\/01  Villaraigosa and Hahn and housing -- It doesn't fire up voters like a  stump speech on crime, schools or traffic congestion. But the sheer magnitude of  the city's housing shortage has placed it squarely--albeit quietly--on the  agendas of both candidates running for mayor of Los Angeles. Eight years of a  widely criticized lack of mayoral attention to the housing problem combined with  a high concentration of low-wage workers has earned Los Angeles a reputation as  one of the most unaffordable, overcrowded metropolitan centers in the country,  plagued by low home ownership rates and slum conditions. Lee Romney in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5\/25\/01  Villaraigosa and Hahn annd crime and gangs -- Mayoral candidates Antonio  Villaraigosa and City Attorney James Hahn continued Thursday to compare their  plans to deal with crime as they near the June 5 runoff election. Hahn, filing  papers in court to seek injunctions against two Wilmington gangs, touted his  efforts over the past several years to control gang activity throughout the  city. \"The root of the violence is drugs and ... for turf and control,\" Hahn  said of the two gangs -- but which, he added, applies to most gangs in the city.  Rick Orlov in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5\/25\/01  Dean Andal  -- State Board of Equalization member Dean Andal is expected to announce today  that he plans to run for state controller next year. The 41-year-old Republican  from Stockton said he will run on a platform that includes lowering utility  taxes paid by residents and businesses in Los Angeles, which are 10% and 12.5%,  respectively. The story is in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5\/25\/01  Jim Rogan  -- President Bush on Thursday nominated former Congressman James Rogan to be  undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S.  Trademark Office. The job pays $130,200 a year. Bush's selection of Rogan, which  will require confirmation by the Senate, could be a positive sign for Hollywood,  which has been lobbying for increased enforcement of copyright laws, including a  crackdown on Internet piracy. Bill Hillburg in  the Los  Angeles Daily News  -- 5\/25\/01  Living wage -- While attorneys speculated on the constitutionality of Santa Monica's  newly approved living wage law, hotel housekeeper Blanca Mendez was just hoping  Thursday that she can benefit if a raise to $10.50 an hour goes into effect next  summer at large downtown and beach-side businesses. \"It would be fantastic,\"  said Mendez, who now earns $8.50 an hour after seven years at the Streamline  Moderne-style Shangri-La Hotel near the ocean. \"The economy is very difficult;  everything is getting expensive, like gas, like energy.\" Oscar Johnson and Ofelia  Casillas in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5\/25\/01  9 tribes' casino plans put on hold -- Gov. Gray Davis won't approve any  more agreements with Indian tribes to allow casinos until the federal courts  resolve a legal challenge to California's Indian gaming law. So far, the  governor's moratorium on new Indian gaming compacts, announced in a letter to  nine California tribes, doesn't appear to affect three Sonoma County tribes that  have announced plans for casinos. But it could delay the progress of the nine  other tribes that have asked the governor to negotiate gaming agreements,  including the Round Valley tribe in Mendocino County. Steve Hart in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5\/25\/01  Charity foundations growth -- California's charitable  foundation assets--which were relatively modest as recently as two decades  ago--are now growing at a rate faster than those in the rest of the country,  according to a study by the new USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. In  1978, California held 8% of national foundation assets; in 1998 it accounted for  14%, the study said. During the same period, the state's share of foundation  grants grew from 7% to 11% of total giving nationwide, it said. \"California is  catching up and jumping forward,\" said Marcia K. Sharp, a research fellow at the  USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy, and a co-author of the study.  Anne-Marie O'Connor in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5\/25\/01  Documents seized in S.F. minority contract probe are  inadmissible -- In a  potential blow to prosecutors, a U.S. judge said that federal investigators  violated a San Francisco city official's privacy rights when they searched her  office looking for evidence of fraud in a city minority contracting program. The  FBI seized hundreds of pages of records from the San Francisco Human Rights  Commission office of chief contract compliance officer Zula Jones in August  1999. Chuck Finnie and Lance Williams in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5\/25\/01  Feinstein fast-tracks water storage plans -- California can't forestall a  water crisis without building more storage facilities, Sen.

Eric Brazil in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Michael Gardner in the  San  Diego Union  -- 5\/25\/01  Californians' recycling efforts hit skids -- Californians are recycling a  lower percentage of redeemable plastic, glass and aluminum beverage containers  than they have in more than a decade, the state Department of Conservation  reported Thursday. While officials note the recycling drop is partially due to  an increasing number of products available for redemption, they also point to  research suggesting consumers' habits may be slipping. Ed  Fletcher in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5\/25\/01  UC admissions policy -- A UC Berkeley request to be  exempted from a University of California admissions policy is creating concern  among administrators and faculty who object to looking at one campus in  isolation. Instead, they said, the Berkeley request probably should be folded  into a systemwide review of admissions already under way. Tanya Schevitz in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5\/25\/01  Irvine cash crop: business -- Irvine One of the largest  commercial developments in the county could be built in the next five to seven  years, replacing checkered fields of strawberries and other crops. The 670 acres  of fields and a scattering of industrial buildings just outside Irvine's  northeastern border is large enough to host 12 Disneylands, but The Irvine Co.  has other plans. Laura Corbin, Jennifer Hieger  and Elizabeth Aguilera in the Orange County  Register  -- 5\/25\/01  Like a Rolling Tone -- It looked like a scene from the  hotel karaoke lounge, where the microphone-hogging guy won't stop belting Tom  Jones tunes and a few cocktail-sipping patrons keep their eyes glued to their  drinks in embarrassment. But it was official state business at the state Capitol  on Thursday when members of the Assembly attempted to pay tribute to Bob Dylan  on his 60th birthday by feebly singing along with his 1973 recording of \"Forever  Young.\" Lesli A. Maxwell in the Fresno  Bee  -- 5\/25\/01  Joe Lockhart -- Barely six months after joining Oracle Corp. as a communications  consultant to chief executive Larry Ellison, former White House press secretary  Joe Lockhart has left the database software firm. Both sides yesterday denied a  rift between the two men and blamed Lockhart's frequent trips from his home in  Washington, D.C., to Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters for the departure.

Gen. Bill  Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a Houston-based power company  should be locked in a prison cell with an amorous, tattooed inmate named  Spike.       Lockyer, who is investigating  whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale electricity  market, made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that  appeared Tuesday.       \"I would love to  personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell  that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike,  honey,' \" Lockyer said.       Enron spokesman  Mark Palmer called the comment \"counterproductive rhetoric\" that \"does not  merit a response.\"       But other industry  representatives denounced the remark as \"outrageous,\" especially because  neither Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges  against Enron or other companies.       \"You'd  expect that the state's chief legal counsel would file charges first and  make public statements second,\" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power  Trading Forum, an association of energy producers and traders. \"We're very  disappointed with his choice of words, which don't exactly fit the profile  of his office.\"       In an interview Tuesday,  Lockyer said he decided to \"ratchet up\" the commentary to \"put [energy  companies] on notice\" that \"we are not afraid of them and have the will to  prosecute.\"       \"What I'm trying to do is  let these economic buccaneers understand that if we catch them, they're  going to be prosecuted,\" Lockyer said. \"Just because they're  multimillionaires and run big corporations, it doesn't provide them with  immunity.\"       The attorney general is  investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits  through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market.  Several panels, including a state Senate committee and the California  Public Utilities Commission, are conducting similar probes.        On Tuesday, Lockyer announced that three  power companies have agreed to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago  by his investigators. The attorney general went to court to obtain the  documents after the companies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand  them over.       Lockyer said the forthcoming  documents would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence  in search of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice  laws.       \"Evidence is accumulating that  certainly infers illegal activity,\" Lockyer said. \"But we need to make  sure it's compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury.\"        Lockyer said he singled out Enron's  chairman because the Houston company is the world's largest energy trader.        At least one observer found Lockyer's  comments refreshingly candid.

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission.  2) Use our \"Transmission Round Table\" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy.  Share this knowledge through a website to be set up.  Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject.  3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Dave Duran; directed by Walter Coffer.  4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (ISO, Transco, RTO)  5) List pertinent Enron web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each.  6) Go to work now!","datetime":993686785,"message_id":54643,"recipient_ids":[29461],"sender_id":1654,"subject":"FW: Transmission Round Table","hashtags":["aaaa","bbbb"]},{"body":"  Return-path: <VKaminski@aol.com> From: VKaminski@aol.com Full-name: VKaminski Message-ID: <122.75b7039.29232af6@aol.com> Date: Tue, 13 Nov 2001 21:03:34 EST Subject: Fwd: FW: To: VKaminski@aol.com MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart\/mixed; boundary=\"part2_9b.1f087330.29232af6_boundary\" X-Mailer: AOL 6.0 for Windows US sub 10539    Return-path: <VKaminski@aol.com> From: VKaminski@aol.com Full-name: VKaminski Message-ID: <170.3bfe18a.291f8941@aol.com> Date: Sun, 11 Nov 2001 02:56:49 EST Subject: Fwd: FW: To: VKaminski@aol.com MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart\/mixed; boundary=\"part3_9b.1f087330.291f8941_boundary\" X-Mailer: AOL 6.0 for Windows US sub 10539    Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable Return-Path: <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com> Received: from  rly-xf05.mx.aol.com (rly-xf05.mail.aol.com [172.20.105.229]) by air-xf01.mail.aol.com (v81.9) with ESMTP id MAILINXF110-1019180521; Fri, 19 Oct 2001 18:05:21 -0400 Received: from  postmaster.enron.com (outbound5.enron.com [192.152.140.9]) by rly-xf05.mx.aol.com (v80.21) with ESMTP id MAILRELAYINXF57-1019180459; Fri, 19 Oct 2001 18:04:59 -0400 Received: from corp.enron.com (nahou-msmsw03p.corp.enron.com [192.168.110.110])\tby postmaster.enron.com (8.10.1\/8.10.1\/external_corp-1.08) with ESMTP id f9JM4w304754\tfor <vkaminski@aol.com>; Fri, 19 Oct 2001 17:04:58 -0500 (CDT) Received: from nahou-mscnx04p.corp.enron.com (unverified) by corp.enron.com (Content Technologies SMTPRS 4.2.1) with SMTP id <T56b254f096c0a86e6e7c0@corp.enron.com> for <vkaminski@aol.com>; Fri, 19 Oct 2001 17:04:58 -0500 Received: from NAHOU-MSMBX03V.corp.enron.com ([192.168.110.40]) by nahou-mscnx04p.corp.enron.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC(5.0.2195.2966);\t Fri, 19 Oct 2001 17:04:58 -0500 X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft Exchange V6.0.4712.0 content-class: urn:content-classes:message MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text\/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\" Subject: FW: Date: Fri, 19 Oct 2001 16:34:52 -0500 Message-ID: <31738B46B7BD864080808A19977D9F757ABD99@NAHOU-MSMBX03V.corp.enron.com> X-MS-Has-Attach: X-MS-TNEF-Correlator: Thread-Topic: Thread-Index: AcFY5W8uV8avQMTXEdWxIgBQi+MJ2QAAEEeg From: \"Kaminski, Vince J\" <Vince.J.Kaminski@ENRON.com> To: \"Lin, Martin\" <Martin.Lin@ENRON.com> Cc: <vkaminski@aol.com> X-OriginalArrivalTime: 19 Oct 2001 22:04:58.0864 (UTC) FILETIME=[17D6F700:01C158EA] X-Mailer: Unknown (No Version)  Martin, Lance  What do you think?

I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this.    First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides.  The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.    However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices.    In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.    As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH.                                                             COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED.                  \"THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE       ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE,\" SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH.                                      THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED  WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN                                                                             (CONT) MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT, AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED.                AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS, RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF  THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA, IT WOULD \"INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE    GENERATION IN THE STATE.\"                                                           THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS    POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO.     SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN, AND NOBODY HAS PROVED OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR  ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT.                                    \"IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN    CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU   BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED,\" SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER.                ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE                                                                               (CONT) STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR   BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO    INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE  IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY, PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T      WORKED, JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME.                       IN FACT, PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE      WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST, PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S     PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME,   LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE.             CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE       INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO,  AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND    THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS  AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S \"BIG BLUE\" VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV.       ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD                                                                            (CONT) HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW.                                        SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING, THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED   BY HUMANS, BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF    MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER      EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO, AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH   NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM, FOR        EXAMPLE, IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO    TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB.                                        AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY: \"IT'S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME      BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST. MARY'S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS.\"                        AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE- AND 10-YEAR CONTRACTS IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -    PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DON'T HAVE TRADING EXPERIENCE.

Business\/Financial Desk; Section A Rival to Buy Enron, Top Energy Trader, After Financial Fall By ALEX BERENSON and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN  11\/10\/2001 The New York Times=20 Page 1, Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company=20  With its stock plunging and its finances in doubt, the world's largest energy trader, the Enron Corporation, agreed to be acquired yesterday by the rival Dynegy Inc. for about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 billion in debt.=20  The deal is an extraordinary turnabout for Enron, a Houston-based company that had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide.  Its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, a big contributor to the Republican Party, provided political influence, while its former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural gas. But last winter, when California's effort to deregulate the electricity market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts, Enron was the subject of much criticism and political anger.=20  Recent disclosures of discrepancies in Enron's financial statements and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused the shares to plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade. As other companies became wary of doing business with it, Enron -- also facing a potential cash squeeze -- apparently had little choice but to find a buyer, and a deal was hastily cobbled together this week.=20  For critics who had complained about Enron's market power and its dominance, the combination poses additional concerns. Dynegy's acquisition of Enron will be reviewed by state and federal agencies, led by the Justice Department and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Analysts said today that they expected scrutiny of the combined companies' holdings in California, where Dynegy owns power-generating plants and Enron accounts for much of the trading of natural gas -- fuel for the state's electric power plants.=20  Buying Enron at a deep discount -- it has lost $60 billion in market value this year -- could make Dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natural gas. But the agreement carries big risks as well. Along with Enron's gas pipelines and high-technology trading floor, Dynegy will take on Enron's substantial debt and a web of complex transactions that Enron has spun over the last decade.=20  In addition to the $13 billion in debt that Enron carries on its books, it has guaranteed at least $4 billion in off-balance sheet loans, and the hidden debt could total as much as $10 billion, said Carol Coale, a stock analyst with Prudential Securities.=20  Charles L. Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that Dynegy could sort through Enron's tangled finances. ''We know the company well,'' Mr. Watson said. ''It's not like we just started fresh. I'm confident that it's as solid as we thought it was.''=20  The new company will combine Enron's 25,000-mile natural gas pipeline system with the large number of power plants that Dynegy owns worldwide, as well as Illinois Power, a Dynegy subsidiary that serves 650,000 customers in Illinois. But its most important asset will be its trading desk. It will be the largest energy trader in the nation, trading more than twice as much power and natural gas as its closest competitors.=20  Mr. Watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties and that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny. ''There's really not a lot of overlap in assets,'' he said.=20  Mr. Watson and Steve Bergstrom, Dynegy's president, will hold those positions in the new company, which will be called Dynegy and remain in Houston. Mr. Lay, who created Enron in the mid-1980's, will not have any role in the combined company's daily operations. He has been asked to join its board but has not provided an answer. ''The last three weeks haven't been a lot of fun,'' he said.=20  In a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon, Mr. Watson said he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company. ''Enron is the ideal strategic partner for Dynegy,'' Mr. Watson said. ''We will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities.''=20  To shore up Enron's finances, Dynegy will immediately put $1.5 billion into Enron through ChevronTexaco, the giant oil company, which already owns 27 percent of Dynegy. Another billion dollars will be injected once the deal is completed.=20  Investors appeared comfortable yesterday that Dynegy could make the deal work. After falling $3, to $33, on Wednesday, when the companies first said they were in discussions, Dynegy rose $5.76 on Thursday and yesterday to close the week at $38.76.=20  ''On paper, it works,'' Ms. Coale of Prudential said. ''The combined company would be the leading trader, the market leader in most of their businesses.'' Ms. Coale, who has a sell rating on Enron and a buy rating on Dynegy, said she planned to keep her buy rating on Dynegy.=20  As it works to have the deal approved, Dynegy will have to persuade Enron's traders to stay with the combined company. The pain of the stock's 90 percent plunge this year will not be equally shared. Some Enron employees have held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated. Meanwhile, Mr. Lay, Mr. Skilling and other former and current executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Enron stock in 2000 and this year.=20  The companies also have very different corporate cultures. Dynegy emphasizes teamwork, while Enron is more competitive, said Ehud Ronn, director of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research at the University of Texas. Even before the merger was announced, Enron had lost some of its employees to other energy trading companies, Mr. Ronn said.=20  Some investors and analysts say that the problems with Enron's finances may extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of Wall Street's scrutiny the last month. James Chanos, a short-seller who has been one of Enron's most vocal critics, said there was increasing evidence that Enron's energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said. ''There appears to be a culture at Enron of aggressively booking profits and deferring or obscuring losses,'' Mr. Chanos said.=20  On Thursday, Enron said in a filing with the S.E.C that it had overstated its earnings by almost $600 million over the last five years. Mr. Chanos said more restatements were possible, noting that the filing disclosed partnerships had been used to hedge almost $1 billion in losses in 2000 and this year. So far, the losses from those partnerships remain off Enron's financial statements, Mr. Chanos said.=20  Enron's stock had been under pressure for most of this year, as the company ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading operation. In August, Mr. Skilling resigned as chief executive, and Mr. Lay resumed control of daily operations.=20  Still, the company appeared financially sound until last month, when it disclosed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financial statements. The announcement unnerved investors, who wondered whether Enron had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance sheet, and led the S.E.C. to begin an investigation.=20  Mr. Lay tried to reassure investors that Enron's finances were in order and that its businesses remained strong. But the last three weeks have brought a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that Enron formed with some of its top executives, including its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow.=20  With questions mounting, the major credit-rating agencies began to downgrade Enron's debt, putting additional pressure on the company. If Enron's debt rating falls below investment grade, it would be forced to repay $3.3 billion in loans that it had guaranteed.=20  To strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock, Enron turned to big investors like Warren E. Buffett in search of billions of dollars of financing. When the financing did not quickly appear, its stock fell further.=20  By this week, some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to Enron, worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contracts. The Mirant Corporation, an Atlanta-based power plant owner and electricity trader, sharply curtailed its trading with Enron this week. ''We're trading with them on a very limited basis,'' said James Peters, a Mirant spokesman. ''It's not business as usual.''=20  On Wednesday, Enron's stock fell as low as $7 a share, its lowest level in more than a decade. That day, news of the Enron and Dynegy talks leaked out.=20  By late Wednesday, the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed to a deal. But Dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether Enron's credit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the effect of the deal on its own rating. The deal moved forward yesterday after Dynegy was assured Enron's debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk status soon after the deal was announced, according to company officials.=20  Dynegy and Enron had provided Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, the main credit agencies, with statements showing them what a combined company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited review of the transaction, Mr. Watson said.=20  Under the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 share of Dynegy stock for each Enron share, or $9.80 based on Dynegy's closing price on Thursday. Enron's stock gained 22 cents yesterday, to $8.63.=20  ''I never thought our stock price would be at this level,'' Mr. Lay said yesterday.=20  Enron's shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company, and Dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company's 14-member board.=20  If the deal falls apart, Enron or Dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of $350 million.=20  To protect Dynegy's and ChevronTexaco's cash infusion, the money will go to an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline. If the merger is not completed, Dynegy will have the right to buy the unit.=20  An army of bankers and lawyers advised the companies. Lehman Brothers Inc. acted as financial adviser and Baker Botts and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld acted as counsel for Dynegy. J. P. Morgan & Company and Salomon Smith Barney acted as financial advisers for Enron, and Vinson & Elkins and Weil Gotshal & Manges acted as the company's counsel. Pillsbury Winthrop served as counsel to ChevronTexaco.

If it wins regulatory and shareholder approval, the deal would propel Dynegy, the sixth-largest U.S. power trader, to the No. 1 position, with more than 30 percent of the market.  The Houston-based competitors are new-breed energy companies, formed to capitalize on wholesale power marketing and trading, with Dynegy emphasizing its own power generation capabilities.=20  Enron, meanwhile, has been laid low in recent weeks by soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and by a series of revelations about questionable accounting practices. Enron this week was forced to restate its earnings over the past five years -- revising them downward by 20 percent, or $586 million -- and has seen its stock price plunge more than 80 percent in the past three weeks.=20  Both Enron and Dynegy have extensive business dealings in Illinois, one of the first states to begin deregulating its electric power industry; among other things, Dynegy owns Illinois Power, a Downstate utility.=20  The new Dynegy would become one of the largest companies in the world, with revenues exceeding $200 billion and assets of roughly $90 billion, company officials said. By comparison, ExxonMobil, the nation's largest company, reported revenues of $232.7 billion in 2000.=20  \"We needed to do something to strengthen our balance sheet and get the investor community focused on the core energy business,\" said Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive. \"We looked at several alternatives; this was in the best interests of our employees and shareholders.\"=20  Lay said he would not have a role in running the new company, but was considering a request to serve on the newly combined board.=20  Watson, Dynegy's chairman, said the merger compact included escape clauses for Dynegy. \"But, I wouldn't be standing here if I expected to see that (used). I really believe the value degradation in Enron had nothing to do with their core business. We looked under the hood, it is just as strong as we thought it was.\"=20  Still, Watson acknowledged the possibility that more problems may surface at Enron. \"I don't think anybody can absolutely unequivocally say there's nothing (more) there,\" he said.=20  Dynegy's stock price closed higher Friday, rising $2.26, or 6.2 percent, to $38.76. Enron's stock was down 33 cents, or 3.7 percent, at $8.63 a share.=20  Together, the companies have natural gas sales of about 40 billion cubic feet per day through the third quarter of 2001 and power sales exceeding 500 million megawatt hours through the third quarter of 2001. In addition, the new Dynegy's delivery network will include more than 22,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 25,000 miles of interstate pipelines. In Enron, Dynegy is taking on a company saddled with a heavy debt load and a credit rating that has been downgraded to near junk bond status and is under the cloud of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.=20  Under the stock for stock swap portion of the deal, valued at $8.846 billion, Dynegy is paying about $10.41 a share for the 850 million outstanding Enron shares. Dynegy would pay .2685 shares of its stock for each share of Enron.=20  In addition, Dynegy agreed to provide $1.5 billion infusion in cash to help stabilize its much larger competitor and assume an estimated $15 billion in debt.=20  Just Thursday Enron reported that its debt was an estimated $12.9 billion pending completion of financial statements dated Sept. 30. A day later the company's accounting of its debt jumped $2 billion.=20  Dynegy's current shareholders, including Chevron Texaco Corp., will end up owning 64 percent of the new company. Chevron Texaco said it would invest an additional $2.5 billion in Dynegy.=20  Enron's stockholders will own about 36 percent of the combined company's stock at closing, which is anticipated for the third quarter of 2002.=20  In Illinois, in addition to Illinois Power, Dynegy owns a Chicago area electricity peaker plant and is a partner with Nicor Inc., in Nicor Energy, an unregulated natural gas utility in the Chicago area.=20  Enron's subsidiary, Enron Energy Services, has a high-profile contract to provide 60 percent of Chicago city government's electricity. It also has contracts to provide electricity to Quaker Oats Co. and the University of Chicago, among others.=20  In addition to Watson, other top Dynegy management will remain in place in the new company. Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc., and Rob Doty, chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc., will retain those positions in the combined company. Enron's current president and chief operating officer, Greg Whalley, will become an executive vice president of the new Dynegy. The board of directors of the combined company will be comprised of 14 members. Dynegy's 11 designees will include three from ChevronTexaco. Enron will have the right to designate a minimum of three board members.  .....................................................................................................................................=20  Business\/Financial Desk; Section C Regulators Struggle With a Marketplace Created by Enron By JEFF GERTH with RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.  11\/10\/2001 The New York Times=20 Page 1, Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company=20  WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 -- For years, the Enron Corporation used its political muscle to build the markets in which it thrived, pushing relentlessly on Capitol Hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation's natural gas and electricity businesses.=20  Its achievement, as one Enron executive said today, in creating a ''regulatory black hole'' fit nicely with what he called the company's ''core management philosophy, which was to be the first mover into a market and to make money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency.''  Now, Wall Street's dissatisfaction with Enron's secretive ways has delivered the company into the arms of its much smaller Houston rival, Dynegy Inc., in a deal worth about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 billion in debt. The combination of the two companies, energy experts and lawmakers said today, poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggling to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that Enron invented.=20  ''We're in a supersonic-speed era of electronic trading with a horse-and-buggy-era regulatory system to protect consumers,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap.=20  Dynegy's acquisition of Enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies, led by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20  Analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined companies' holdings in California, where Dynegy owns generating plants and Enron controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas -- the fuel for a big share of the state's electric power plants.=20  ''Dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity,'' said Frank Wolak, a professor of economics at Stanford University.=20  Mr. Wolak, a consultant to the Justice Department on a 1999 antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas companies in Southern California, said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing today's deal.=20  The transaction ''is something the Department of Justice needs to look at, and they are going to have a hard time looking at,'' Mr. Wolak said. ''And it's beyond the ability of the F.E.R.C. to look at.''=20  Pat Wood -- named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this year with the backing of Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of Enron -- acknowledged in an interview today that the agency had ''a long way to go'' in matching the sophistication of the companies it regulates.=20  But he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with the new risk management techniques pioneered by Enron, Dynegy and other energy companies. It is hiring more experts, he said, adopting more restrictive rules on how much ''market power'' one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions.=20  In an interview this evening, Charles L. Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, said he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with Enron would require the sale of any assets. ''We haven't really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture,'' he said. ''There's not really any overlap.''=20  A senior executive at one of Enron's largest energy-trading rivals disagreed. ''I don't think this deal gets through unscathed,'' he said today. ''I'm sure the Justice Department and the F.T.C. will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energy-trading area.''=20  Enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity -- indeed, the biggest player in both those markets -- and it also owns a network of gas pipelines. Dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electricity. Each company owns a local electric utility, too: Dynegy owns Illinois Power in Decatur, Ill., while Enron owns Portland General Electric in Portland, Ore., but last month announced plans to sell it to another Oregon utility.=20  For a decade, as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into the nation's biggest energy trader, Enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in Washington and the enthusiastic backing of Wall Street.=20  In the early months of the Bush administration, Mr. Lay -- whose company was one of the biggest financial backers of George W. Bush's presidential campaign -- played a prominent, and some said unusual, role in helping the White House pick nominees to the federal energy commission. Enron executives met with Vice President Dick Cheney, whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by Mr. Lay.=20  Now, ''the company has become a pariah,'' an Enron executive said today. ''The Bush administration doesn't want to have anything to do with us.''=20  The problems began with the energy crisis in California, where Enron's outspoken defense of deregulation, even more than its electricity trading activities, made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates. In the financial markets, meanwhile, Enron's confusing disclosures, tolerated when its stock was soaring, drew disdain as the calming of the energy storms in California and other parts of the country beat the shares down, starting last spring.=20  ''Enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency,'' Mr. Wolak said. As California officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control, he said, Enron's ''view was that we want everybody's data, but if you want ours, get a subpoena.''=20  Energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marked Enron's attitude about government oversight.=20  Electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies, operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their service areas. A few entrepreneurs, led by Mr. Lay, conceived a different model in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporate users or utilities in faraway regions, at whatever price the market would bear.=20  In the early 1990's, Congress -- under heavy lobbying by Enron -- passed legislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers. Before long, Enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates. The market for interstate sales of natural gas had been freed up a few years earlier, and critics complained that traders like Enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices.=20  In the mid-1990's, independent gas producers backed legislation in Congress to allow the creation of a co-operative marketing organization, which, they hoped, would have helped stabilize prices.=20  Raymond Plank, the chairman of the Apache Corporation, a gas producer based in Houston, said that the big gas marketing and trading companies, including Enron, successfully lobbied to kill the plan, leaving prices as volatile as ever.=20  ''It was a great concept,'' Mr. Plank said. ''We could have headed off the problems we have today.''=20  Enron's final lobbying success came last year. With a strong push from the company's lobbyists, Congress passed futures trading legislation that exempted Internet energy trading platforms like EnronOnline, the industry leader, from oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Enron takes the other side of trades on its exchange. In traditional markets like the New York Mercantile Exchange, which remain subject to oversight, the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers.=20  Under Mr. Watson, Dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than Enron, and though California politicians denounced it, too, as a profiteer during the energy crisis, most analysts say it has been less aggressive than Enron in both its business practices and its lobbying.=20  Indeed, the rival energy-trading executive today predicted ''a huge culture clash'' as the Houston neighbors merge. ''Blood will flow in Houston over the integration of the trading operation,'' he said.=20  But regulators may find Dynegy easier to deal with.=20  Earlier this year, the federal energy commission asked for comments on whether it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines and energy-trading shops owned by the same company.=20  Enron wondered what all the bother was. ''Would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not,'' it wrote in a regulatory filing, ''or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the more successful participants in the marketplace?''=20  Dynegy, by contrast, painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down. ''Abuses abound,'' it said, ''because of financial windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market.''  .....................................................................................................................................=2020 Report on Business: Canadian Dynegy to buy troubled rival Enron Reuter News Agency  11\/10\/2001 The Globe and Mail=20 Metro B4 \"All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors.

MULLIGAN; NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITERS  11\/10\/2001 Los Angeles Times=20 Home Edition A-1 Copyright 2001 \/ The Times Mirror Company=20  Enron Corp., the once-highflying energy giant whose aggressive efforts to profit from California's energy deregulation made it a target of consumer and political backlash, on Friday agreed to be saved from possible financial collapse through a proposed acquisition by rival Dynegy Inc.=20  The roughly $7.7-billion deal is a stunning plot twist for Houston-based Enron, which was vilified in California as it was being glorified on Wall Street. In only the last month, a series of disturbing financial revelations pushed to the edge of ruin this once-powerful company, whose top executives had lectured California on its energy foibles and who influenced the direction of national energy policy.  Enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and, in the end, financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing.=20  Now, the company that late last year had a market value of $63 billion is worth one-tenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a cross-town competitor one-quarter its size. Enron's proud and influential chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, who became a focus of bitter attacks by California politicians and regulators, would lose his job, as would many others at Enron.=20  Even the name would disappear. The combined company would be called Dynegy Inc. if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals.=20  California officials took no joy in Enron's fate Friday, though there was perhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state.=20  \"This is basically a rogue corporation,\" said Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), an outspoken critic of Enron for years who dealt with the company as he chaired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of California's landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996. \"It has from the beginning been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law--a fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law of the land.\"=20  A Failed Experiment=20  Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said that although Enron was never a major force in California's doomed electricity market, it was outspoken in support of deregulation.=20  \"In a sense, their experiment was much like California's experiment--a failure,\" he said.=20  Said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica: \"Nothing could better illustrate the disaster of deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents, which reaped the reward of deregulation, is suffering the consequences.\"=20  Enron is the world's largest energy trader, handling one of four energy deals in the United States through its online trading operation, EnronOnline. Since it reported a surprising third-quarter loss on Oct. 16, partly tied to shadowy investment vehicles, Enron has endured a huge loss of investor confidence, which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its trading business.=20  Under the deal announced Friday, Dynegy, invited in two weeks ago after Enron fell short in its efforts to line up new financing, would immediately help Enron by pouring $1.5 billion in cash into the company. The money would be provided by ChevronTexaco Corp., the San Francisco oil company that owns nearly 27% of Dynegy.=20  Enron shareholders would get 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, which values the company at about $7.7 billion based on Friday's stock close. Dynegy shares surged $2.26 to close at $38.76 per share on the New York Stock Exchange; Enron added 22 cents to close at $8.63 per share, still off 89% year to date.=20  If the deal closes in six to nine months, as the parties expect, Dynegy and ChevronTexaco would invest $1 billion additionally in the combined company.=20  \"This is just a financial bonanza really for both companies,\" said Charles L. Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive, who will head the combined company. Watson said the merger would immediately add to Dynegy's earnings.=20  Even so, the repercussions of Enron's fall from grace could be far-reaching. Coming on the heels of California's energy crisis, Enron's troubles may slow the country's march toward energy deregulation, which Lay and Enron championed for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in general.=20  But the deal announced Friday will prevent an even worse outcome, energy experts said: the threatened collapse of Enron, which would clog up for a time the business of buying and selling electricity, natural gas and oil. That could interfere with delivery of energy around the country, they said.=20  \"This is an encouraging development for the energy industry,\" said Stephen Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, the San Diego-based parent of Southern California Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric. \"The Enron-Dynegy combination will create a credit-worthy counter-party which will help preserve order in the marketplace. It also will reinforce confidence in the energy trading business going forward.\"=20  But some in the industry are less pleased.=20  Raymond Plank, chairman of Apache Corp., a Houston-based natural gas exploration and development firm, said he is considering a motion to the Federal Trade Commission against the proposed merger.=20  \"There are issues of concentration in a combination of the largest energy trader, Enron, and the fifth-largest, Dynegy,\" Plank said. \"California should be particularly concerned because Dynegy owns power plants there and Enron has pipelines and other interests.\"=20  Troubles Mount as Stock Plunges=20  The swagger that was Enron is long gone. Consider:=20  * Enron's brash chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, touted only months ago as one of the young stars of American business, abruptly resigned in August, citing personal reasons. Enron's stock already had fallen from its high of nearly $90 per share as investments in water and telecommunications turned sour, a fact that contributed to Skilling's departure.=20  * The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation of Enron's controversial dealings with a number of limited partnerships, some organized and run by Enron managers, including Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last month.=20  * In an extraordinary confession Thursday, Enron announced that it had overstated profit by $586 million, or 20%, during the last five years. The earlier financial statements reported to Wall Street and the investing public, Enron said, \"should not be relied upon.\"=20  * The company also fired its treasurer and a corporate lawyer, both of whom it said were investors in one of the limited partnerships. Yet some analysts questioned whether, even in its admission of accounting trickery, Enron wasn't still holding something back.=20  * Credit-rating agencies, which already have downgraded Enron's bonds to barely above \"junk\" status, continue to pore over Enron's books. Analysts have said a further downgrade to the level of junk, or below investment grade, could precipitate a crisis akin to a run on a bank and threaten Enron's survival while the merger is pending.=20  With its stock crumbling and trading partners leery about its ability to pay its debts, Enron was forced to walk hat in hand down Houston's Energy Alley to negotiate a saving takeover by Dynegy, the rival once jokingly dismissed as \"Enron Lite.\"=20  In the trading markets where Enron still holds a leading but increasingly vulnerable position, other players already are stepping up to grab a bigger share of the business. Even if Enron's trading operation survives more or less intact, under the wing of a Dynegy or some other company, experts said it may never regain its former level of dominance.=20  \"Enron has been a very innovative shop, willing to spend considerably to establish new markets,\" said analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in New York. \"If that culture is not kept, everyone loses.\"=20  Skilling and mentor Lay had worked for a decade to create both a new kind of company and a new set of markets for it to play.=20  In large part, they succeeded. Enron transformed itself from a traditional gas pipeline company into a high-tech global trader of everything from electricity to pollution credits to aluminum. The company's overarching strategy was to pare its physical assets to the minimum to get the maximum profit bang from its intellectual capital: the ranks of MBAs and PhDs that filled its Houston trading floor.=20  Rather than maintain its own expensive gas fields and power plants--which it relegated to stodgy utilities and oil companies--Enron would handle everything by contract, relying on a network of suppliers to obtain, store and deliver the goods while the company focused on squeezing out the best price.=20  Dynegy, in contrast, has invested in such energy assets, including three power plants in Southern California. It uses those assets to back its trading operation, which is much smaller than Enron's.=20  Enron pulled off a migration from the \"dirty\" extreme of the oil patch, the asset-intensive domain of drillers and explorers, to the \"clean\" end, where all the deals are done on a computer screen. It also was a migration from lower profit margins and lower risk to high margins and high risk.=20  Shannon B. Burchett, chief executive of Risk Limited Corp., an energy-oriented strategic-management consultancy in Dallas, compared Enron to the investment bank Salomon Bros., where he used to work in the former PhiBro commodities unit.=20  Enron, Burchett said, embodies \"a Wall Street culture that happens to be in Houston.\"=20  Wall Street certainly \"got it,\" or thought it did.=20  Accounting Rules Pushed to the Limit=20  At Enron's zenith last year, when its stock peaked near $90 a share and it was pushing into esoteric markets for weather derivatives and fiber-optic bandwidth, Enron seemed to be a one-company wave of the future.=20  Enron's aggressiveness, brainpower and willingness to back radical new ideas with serious capital helped it acquire an aura that in some ways was its undoing, analysts said.=20  Investors accorded Enron's stock a price-to-earnings valuation that was consistently higher than those of its peers, reflecting the view that its cutting-edge business model could consistently deliver faster-growing profit than its competitors.=20  To keep profits arcing ever upward to justify the outsize valuation, Enron began pushing the accounting rules as hard as it pushed competitors in the trading arena. It acknowledged as much in its statement Thursday, conceding that the operations of three of the limited partnerships should have been consolidated with Enron's own financial statements instead of being held separate.=20  By raising capital and running deals through the limited partnerships, Enron could keep large amounts of debt and certain volatile assets off its own balance sheet, while simultaneously booking profit from the partnerships' transactions, analyst Meade said.=20  Deals Backed by Costly Guarantees=20  One risky aspect of some of Enron's deals through the partnerships was what Meade called a \"double-trigger guarantee,\" under which Enron would pledge a cash payout if either its bond rating fell below investment grade or its stock declined below a certain price.=20  The guarantees must have seemed a cheap way to sweeten a deal when Enron's stock was flying high, but they came back to haunt the company later, when it had to pay cash to make good on its obligations, Meade said.=20  Other energy-trading companies use similar devices, but Enron carried it to an extreme and disclosed too little detail to make the process understandable to investors, he said.=20  Enron's magic, like that of the Internet-stock phenomenon, had never been easy to understand in the first place. The company had a reputation among analysts for providing scanty financial detail and hard-to-grasp explanations of some of its dealings.=20  But as long as the reported profit kept climbing, Enron kept getting the benefit of the doubt.=20  M. Carol Coale, a respected Houston-based analyst for Prudential Securities, ruefully recalled a time last winter when she told Enron she could find \"no positive catalyst for the stock\" and was considering downgrading her investment opinion.=20  Skilling telephoned Coale and asked her to hold off, promising her that there was unspecified good news on the horizon that would justify her faith.=20  \"I believed him,\" Coale said last week in an interview in Houston. She held her rating steady at that time but has since downgraded Enron to an outright \"sell.\"=20  Instead of Skilling's promised good news, questions mounted during the spring, and Enron's stock continued a steady decline. Coale and other analysts were troubled that a large proportion of Enron's earnings seemed to come not from its core trading operations but from unusual transactions involving the company's own stock or that of affiliates.=20  In California, Enron played a key role as chief cheerleader for electricity deregulation and a key energy middleman in the state. As wholesale electricity prices soared and the state plunged into its energy crisis late last year, Enron and other out-of-state electricity generators and traders became favorite targets of California politicians and regulators, who said the companies were manipulating the market and charging too much for power.=20  But significantly, California was not a directly successful territory for Enron.=20  Markets in water did not develop as Enron subsidiary Azurix envisioned. And Enron's plans for selling electricity to retail customers were deferred even as deregulation took effect in 1998 because the state's deregulation formulas didn't allow room for retail competition.=20  Lay complained about California frequently and met with the governor to try to influence the state's moves to repair its energy problems. In an interview in his Houston office in January--overlooking Enron's new headquarters building, which is still under construction as the company's name disappears--Lay said he and other Enron executives had objected to the way California regulation was set up.=20  \"We objected more vehemently than anyone. We opposed the concept of the pool,\" he said, referring to the now-defunct California Power Exchange, in which most of the state's power was bought and sold in an hourly market. \"What competitive market in the world has a pool? We don't buy our groceries through a centralized PX.\"=20  Enron also backed away from building a small power plant in California last year when the state imposed price caps.=20  One of the loudest complaints by Davis and other California officials was that generators of electricity were playing \"games\" to get higher prices.=20  They criticized Enron severely, too, even though it was not a major generator, because the level of its worldwide trading operations--buying and selling contracts worth billions of dollars in electric power every day--gave Enron immense sway over pricing and supplies of electricity. They also believe that Enron and Lay helped play a part in the reluctance of federal regulators for several months to place restraints on the California marketplace.=20  CEO's Future Role Uncertain=20  \"Millions of people in California businesses lost money because this rogue company succeeded in controlling the government of the United States,\" said state Sen. Peace, one of the architects of the state's deregulation plan.=20  \"Ken Lay was a mystic,\" Peace said. \"Whatever he said had to make sense because he was Ken Lay. It was hero worship.=20  \"Many of the people working as economists at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission worshiped Ken Lay. As a consequence, the things Enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged, intellectually and otherwise.\"=20  Lay, who has been asked to sit on the board of the combined company, said Friday that he had not yet decided whether to accept.=20  He described his time building Enron as \"a very long ride. It's been a very good ride for the most part.=20  \"I have to say the last few weeks have not been very much fun,\" he said.=20  *=20  Rivera Brooks reported from Los Angeles and Mulligan from Houston and New York.

Dynegy also will assume a hefty $15 billion in Enron debt.=20  The announcement came after Enron's stock price plummeted about 80 percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn't revealing serious financial problems to shareholders.  Under the deal, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns more than a quarter of Dynegy, would quickly provide about $1.5 billion. ChevronTexaco also would contribute an additional $1 billion upon completion of the deal, the companies said.=20  \"With its market-making capabilities, earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets, Enron is the ideal strategic partner for Dynegy,\" Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer Chuck Watson said in announcing the purchase.=20  Watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted explosive disclosures by Enron this week -- including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off the company's books.=20  \"As a combined company, we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and, as always, we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities,\" Watson said.=20  Enron is the country's top buyer and seller of natural gas, and the No. 1 wholesale power marketer. The company operates a 25,000-mile gas pipeline system, and also markets and trades metals, paper, coal, chemicals and fiber-optic bandwidth.=20  Dynegy controls nearly 15,000 megawatts of power generating capacity through investments in power projects, and sells the energy in wholesale markets and through utilities.=20  At a news conference, Watson said company officials who negotiated the deal came away convinced that Enron was worth buying despite its recent troubles.=20  \"We looked under the hood . . . it's just as strong as it ever was,\" Watson said.=20  Under the terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive .2685 Dynegy share for each share of Enron common stock, valuing each Enron share at $10.41. Enron has about 775 million common shares, said spokeswoman Karen Denne.=20  That represents a 21 percent premium above Enron's closing price of $8.63 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange -- but still just a fraction of their 52-week high of $84.87. Dynegy's shares climbed $2.26, or 6 percent, to close at $38.76 on the NYSE.=20  In after hours trading on the NYSE, Enron shares shot up 15.6 percent, or $1.35, to $9.98. Dynegy shares were unchanged.=20  Dynegy's stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company, with Enron's stockholders holding the remainder.=20  The boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close next summer. The deal is expected to save the combined company between $400 million and $500 million annually because of continued elimination of \"non-core\" Enron holdings and lower operating costs.=20  Watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company, which will retain the Dynegy Inc. name. Steve Bergstrom will remain as president of Dynegy.=20  Enron chairman and chief executive Kenneth L. Lay will no longer have a role in day-to-day management of the company, but has been offered a seat on the combined company's board and will help shepherd the merger through.=20  \"I am personally committed to working with Chuck Watson, Steve Bergstrom and their colleagues in the months ahead to accomplish the merger and to build a solid foundation for future value creation,\" Lay said.=20  Dynegy said that Greg Whalley, the current president and chief operating officer of Enron, will become an executive vice president of the new Dynegy. He said the merger sets the best course for Enron.=20  \"Few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provided us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger with Dynegy could deliver,\" Whalley said. \"Together with Enron's recently announced bank commitments, this cash infusion gives Enron immediate liquidity, which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating.\"=20  The merger was announced a day after Enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20  Analysts said the merger rescues Enron, but leaves Dynegy in uncharted territory -- with the outcome of the SEC investigation completely unknown. \"There is still a shroud hanging over Enron that now moves over to Dynegy,\" said Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities.  .....................................................................................................................................=20   Business Dynegy, Enron OK $25 billion deal ; New company would rank among largest Melita Marie Garza, Tribune staff reporter  11\/10\/2001 Chicago Tribune=20 North Final ; N 1 (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)=20  Enron Corp., the nation's biggest power trader, was taken over by its smaller, more conservative rival, Dynegy Inc., in a merger deal valued at nearly $25 billion, company officials announced Friday.=20  The combined company would retain the Dynegy name and would be headed by Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive. If it wins regulatory and shareholder approval, the deal would propel Dynegy, the sixth-largest U.S. power trader, to the No. 1 position, with more than 30 percent of the market.  The Houston-based rivals are new-breed energy companies, formed to capitalize on wholesale power marketing and trading, with Dynegy emphasizing its own power generation capabilities.=20  Enron, meanwhile, has been laid low in recent weeks by soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and by a series of revelations about questionable accounting practices. Enron this week was forced to restate its earnings over the past five years--revising them downward by 20 percent, or $586 million --and has seen its stock price plunge more than 80 percent in the past three weeks.=20  Both Enron and Dynegy have extensive business dealings in Illinois, one of the first states to begin deregulating its electric power industry; among other things, Dynegy owns Illinois Power, a downstate utility.=20  The new Dynegy would be one of the largest companies in the world, with revenues exceeding $200 billion and assets of roughly $90 billion, company officials said. By comparison, ExxonMobil Corp., the nation's largest company, reported revenues of $232.7 billion in 2000.=20  \"We needed to do something to strengthen our balance sheet and get the investor community focused on the core energy business,\" said Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and CEO. \"We looked at several alternatives; this was in the best interests of our employees and shareholders.\"=20  Lay said he would not have a role in running the new company but was considering a request to serve on the newly combined board.=20  Watson said the merger agreement included escape clauses for Dynegy, \"but I wouldn't be standing here if I expected to see that [used]. I really believe the value degradation in Enron had nothing to do with their core business. We looked under the hood; it is just as strong as we thought it was.\"=20  Still, Watson acknowledged the possibility that more problems may surface at Enron. \"I don't think anybody can absolutely unequivocally say there's nothing [more] there,\" he said.=20  Dynegy's stock price closed higher Friday, rising $2.26, or 6.2 percent, to $38.76. Enron's stock was up 22 cents, or 2.6 percent, at $8.63 a share.=20  Through the third quarter of 2001, the companies together have natural gas sales of about 40 billion cubic feet per day and power sales exceeding 500 million megawatt hours. In addition, the new Dynegy's delivery network would include more than 22,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 25,000 miles of interstate pipelines.=20  In Enron, Dynegy is taking on a company saddled with a heavy debt load, a credit rating that has been downgraded to near junk bond status and which is under the cloud of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.=20  Big premium=20  Under the stock-for-stock-swap portion of the deal, valued at $8.846 billion, Dynegy is paying the equivalent of $10.41 a share for the 850 million outstanding Enron shares, a 24 percent premium. Dynegy would pay .2685 shares of its stock for each share of Enron.=20  In addition, Dynegy agreed to provide a $1.5 billion cash infusion to help stabilize its larger competitor and to assume an estimated $15 billion in debt.=20  On Thursday Enron reported that its debt was an estimated $12.9 billion pending completion of financial statements dated Sept. 30. A day later the company's accounting of its debt jumped $2 billion.=20  Dynegy's current shareholders, including Chevron Texaco Corp., will end up owning 64 percent of the new company. Chevron Texaco said it would invest an additional $2.5 billion in Dynegy.=20  Enron's stockholders would own about 36 percent of the combined company's stock at closing, which is anticipated in the third quarter of 2002.=20  Chicago-area operations=20  In Illinois, in addition to Illinois Power, Dynegy owns a Chicago- area electricity peaker plant and is a partner with Nicor Inc. in Nicor Energy, an unregulated natural gas utility in the Chicago market.=20  Enron's subsidiary, Enron Energy Services, has a high-profile contract to provide 60 percent of Chicago's city government's electricity. It also has contracts to provide power to Quaker Oats Co. and the University of Chicago, among others.=20  In addition to Watson, other top Dynegy management would remain in place in the new company. President Steve Bergstrom and Rob Doty, chief financial officer, would retain those positions in the combined company. Enron's president and chief operating officer, Greg Whalley, would become an executive vice president.=20  The board of directors of the combined company would have 14 members. Dynegy's 11 designees would include three from ChevronTexaco. Enron would have the right to designate a minimum of three board members.  .....................................................................................................................................=20  Financial Enron Accepts $8 Billion Buyout Offer From Dynegy; Energy Giant Was Forced to Negotiating Table After Disclosing That It Had Overstated Earnings Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer  11\/10\/2001 The Washington Post=20 FINAL E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved=20  Embattled Enron Corp. yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about $8 billion from crosstown rival Dynegy Inc. If the deal is completed, it would end Houston-based Enron's reign as the leader in the huge energy trading markets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation.=20  Its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered, Enron was forced to the negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a complex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the trading powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligations. Four top Enron officials have resigned or been replaced since July and, once Dynegy takes control, Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth Lay, will also leave the company. Lay said yesterday that he had not decided whether to accept Dynegy's offer to serve on the combined company's board.  \"It's been a good ride for a long time,\" Lay said in a conference call last night. \"The last three weeks haven't been a whole lot of fun.\"=20  The final deal was announced after the close of stock trading. Enron's shares -- which had fallen from $33 to $8 after the disclosures -- ended the day slightly higher, at $8.63. Dynegy's stock closed at $38.76, up $2.26.=20  Dynegy offered all stock for the Enron shares, so the total value of the deal will fluctuate with Dynegy's stock price. Dynegy also said it would assume about $13 billion in Enron debt, bringing the total value of the transaction to around $21 billion.=20  Dynegy's rescue of Enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $1.5 billion, which will be supplied by ChevronTexaco Corp., a major Dynegy stockholder. ChevronTexaco will invest another $1 billion in Dynegy after the acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed, which executives said they expect will take six to nine months as Enron tries to unscramble the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20  The takeover agreement gives Dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cancel the purchase if Enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgments from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships.=20  Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, said in the conference call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of Enron's financial condition convinced him that the company's trading and pipeline businesses were solid. \"We looked under the hood, and guess what? It looked just as strong as we thought it was.\" Watson said he did not think more damaging disclosures were forthcoming from Enron.=20  Until the partnership mess, Enron was the nation's dominant energy trader, and it had front-door political connections to the White House. Lay, its longtime chairman, raised more then $100,000 for the presidential election campaign of his friend George W. Bush. Enron rode the growth of energy trading markets beginning in the mid-1990s, as first natural gas, and then electric power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level. Its revenues leaped from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion last year.=20  During those heady times, the Houston company could choose which questions to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its Byzantine bookkeeping.=20  \"It was always very difficult to get information,\" said Louis B. Gagliardi, an analyst with John S. Herold Inc. \"They would always rebuff you.\"=20  Until this fall, the muscular company seemed too big to stumble, said investment manager David Coxe, with Harris Insight Equity Fund in Chicago.=20  Coxe bought 78,000 shares of Enron at $40 a share in August, after wrestling with the decision for months, he said. Then Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's chief executive and strategic mastermind, unexpectedly resigned. The stock, which had been as high as $90 in August 2000, pitched downward.=20  \"Enron seemed so indispensable to the nation's energy markets that I thought it inconceivable it could implode,\" Coxe said. \"That's how I got sucked in.\"=20  Enron's fall is \"classic hubris,\" Coxe said: a Greek tragedy striking someone who chose to defy the gods -- \"in this case, the rules of the system.\"=20  Among the rules that Enron now acknowledges it didn't follow were the accounting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created. The purpose of the partnerships, Enron said, was to reduce the risks of investments in Internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other assets it no longer wanted.=20  The accounting errors were described in a 20-page SEC filing Enron made Thursday. The errors resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction in the value of shareholders' equity. The company also said it had overstated its earnings by $586 million since 1997.=20  Enron created partnerships that would buy major assets -- such as a power plant -- that Enron wanted to sell, or in other cases, assets such as fiber-optic cable networks that Enron intended to run but did not want to have on its balance sheet.=20  The partnerships had outside investors, but the general partner of two of them was Enron's own chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. He earned $30 million in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships, according to the SEC document.=20  Enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock, or securities convertible into stock. Some of those stock transactions should have been counted as loans, resulting in the $1.2 billion drop in shareholder equity, Enron now says.=20  Investors are asking why Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, did not insist that these transactions be handled that way in the first place. Enron's SEC filing mentions but does not explain some \"proposed audit adjustments\" over the past four years that were overruled.=20  Even though, as Enron now acknowledges, it created an information barrier, masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules, many financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pushing hard enough to punch through that barrier, some analysts acknowledge.=20  \"It was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and say, 'I don't understand it,' \" Gagliardi said.=20  The questions are now coming, from a new committee reporting to Enron's board that will investigate how the company's financial reporting was handl","datetime":1005373504,"message_id":63057,"recipient_ids":[3441,3538,3444,1544,1543,4638,1454,3443,495,1724,5118,2201,222,1179,3484,6152,2176,275,293,701,2287,2202,4132,8851,1453,1456,4769,6153,1637,5480,227,1978,1977,3451,4931,1621,4935,3445,3448,1595,3474,6015,1611,3448,1770,2168,6104,2172,1388,5119,5120,2315,5125],"sender_id":1180,"subject":"Merger News Articles","hashtags":["aaaa","bbbb"]},{"body":"Nelson,  I don't see any problems with #1.

If there is a problem, let me know.  2) A manuscript based on my dissertation work was recently accepted for publication by ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering.  I would like to use my Enron address and contact information on the work, but am unsure of company policies.  I can certainly default to the Rice information if there is a problem.

It should be noted that a vote is pending in the Argentine Congress (had been expected today) to adjust the convertibility law in Argentina to allow a basket of euros and U.S. dollars in equal weights (once parity is reached for euro-dollar) that would replace the existing one-for-one peso to US dollar currency board.  The economy ministry took a first step toward this new basket regime by introducing this week a dual-exchange rate system for the traded sector that allows Argentine exporters to benefit from the weaker euro by receiving export earnings in line with a mixed basket of 50% euros and 50% US dollars.  At today's spot rates, this implies an 8% depreciation of the peso vis-a-vis the basket.  An 8% devaluation at this juncture does not gain the kind of competitiveness needed by Argentine exporters to help boost economy when a major trading partner, Brazil, has depreciated 21% vis-a-vis the USD since the beginning of this year.  Initial reports indicate that consumer and corporate borrowers, however, would still pay debt service at the dollar peg exchange rate (one-for-one). =20  With such a change in currency regime as being contemplated in the Argentine Congress, investor confidence could wane if the plan is approved and as the implications of the new plan are interpreted by the market and as the sustainability of the existing currency board arrangement outside the export sector is analyzed.  A loss of investor confidence will put additional pressure on the peso, pressure which has not existed previous to this new announcement by economy chief Cavallo, especially now that the government's debt swap (exchanging short-term goverment paper for longer-term bonds) has been successfully executed.  As a consequence, although our forecast attached below assumes a one-for-one peso peg to the US dollar at this point to allow the quarterly revaluations to be completed in a timely fashion, this curve is subject to change upon knowledge of the Congressional vote and an analysis of the details announced with the vote as to the mechanics of this new basket regime for exporters and for the economy as a whole.

He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried \"Wolf!\" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims.   But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state =01* and nobody will believe it.   True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators.   But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market, and that the actions of generators \"gaming the system\" have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently =01* and very profitably =01* short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity.   As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that \"generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market\" =01* a view shared by a growing number of other researchers.   Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say \"apparently\" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey =01* the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls =01* voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual.   What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions =01* ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not.   Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls \"megawatt laundering\" =01* selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to \"imports\" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: \"I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient.\"   The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there =01* indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts =01* but FERC has ignored all of them.   The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it, that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan \"a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout\" from the looming disaster.   Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.  http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/04\/29\/opinion\/29KRUG.html?ex=3D989601563&ei=3D1&en=3D6a9 00f004b3b1abf  \/-----------------------------------------------------------------\\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

Jeffords has never mattered much to Californians. Until now.        The Vermont senator's widely anticipated  decision to abandon his fellow Republicans and put Democrats in control of  the Senate could have big implications for California, particularly on  energy and environmental policy, lawmakers and lobbyists said Wednesday.        The change, which Jeffords is expected  to announce today, could increase political pressure on the Bush  administration to respond more aggressively to California's electricity  crisis, these insiders said.       And it  might force the White House to compromise on key elements of the national  energy policy it unveiled last week. In fact, the administration's  proposed budget cuts for programs to promote renewable energy were said to  be a factor in Jeffords' decision.       At  the very least, Senate observers said, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is  likely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for  wholesale electricity.       That doesn't  necessarily mean that the administration's critics will be able to have  everything their way. Even if the Senate approves electricity price caps,  for example, the measure would face stiff opposition in the GOP-dominated  House--and a likely veto if it made it to the president's desk.        Still, a Democratic majority in the  Senate would give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up  the political heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on  energy policy.       \"It kicks up the dust,\"  groaned one energy industry lobbyist who requested anonymity.        Observed Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.):  \"If President Bush's hard-edged conservative approach has in fact caused  the balance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate, it will have  profound implications not just for California, but for the environment and  our nation's energy policy.\"        Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as  they contemplated the possible impact of Jeffords' decision on the  policies they care about.       All of a  sudden, they said, it seems less likely that oil exploration will take  place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, that recreational  snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park, or that  the administration's desire to promote nuclear power will be embraced by  Congress.       On the other hand, it seems  more probable that Congress would approve a new plan for managing a vast  swath of the Sierra Nevada to protect the region's oldest trees, consider  legislation to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and  protect California from a resurgence of offshore oil drilling.        \"It's stunning how broad the  repercussions are, particularly on the environment,\" said Gregory Wetstone  of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"We're trying not to count our  chickens before they hatch. But it will be easier for us in our battles at  least to keep from moving backwards.\"        For instance, Jeffords is a chief  advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power plants.  And if events play out as expected, he'll become the new chairman of the  Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue.        Another issue under his purview would be  the two-decade dispute over a proposed repository for the nation's spent  nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.        \"Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey,\"  declared Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society.        Environmentalists had been worried that  a number of pro-development provisions would be packed into appropriation  bills. But with Democratic senators in charge, that would become less of a  threat, they said.       \"Every wacko idea  Republicans have will get a higher level of scrutiny,\" Francis said.        The biggest change would be the power of  Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committees,  and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes.        As part of a new Democratic majority,  Feinstein and fellow California Democrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain  leverage with the administration on a number of issues considered  important to the state.       \"That translates  into more federal assistance for California across the board,\" predicted  Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.        \"I think it means more attention to our  state, for sure,\" Boxer said. \"Right now, the president doesn't seem to  give a darn. They're all looking at California as a Democratic state.  They're not interested.\"       Feinstein, who  has been unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy  crisis, may get better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes  more important to the administration. She has been regarded as a  bridge-builder who worked effectively with Republicans in the past.        \"This has not been a warm and friendly  administration,\" she complained Wednesday. \"They've got people who know  all the answers and don't want to listen.\"        The White House disputed that. In fact,  Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during the president's first  visit to California next week.       Under a  Democratic majority, Feinstein would be in line to chair two  subcommittees: the military construction panel of the Senate  Appropriations Committee, and the technology, terrorism and government  information subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.        Boxer would be in line to chair the  subcommittee on Superfund, waste control and risk assessment, and the  Foreign Relations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism.        Maviglio predicted that the effects of  Jeffords' expected party defection would be felt immediately.        The chairmanship of the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H.  Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has been \"openly hostile to California's  plight,\" and handed to Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), who supports Davis' request  for electricity price controls, according to Maviglio.        Democrats have assailed Bush's energy  plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side. With Democrats in charge  of the Senate, the administration would be more likely to compromise,  perhaps beefing up funding for Democrat-supported causes such as increased  energy assistance to low-income households and more aggressive promotion  of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.

It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support\/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended. The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an \"informational\" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support\/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright\/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX). The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail. The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill. Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).  What people don't know: Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature.  Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone). Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.  Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.  Best, Jeff  Sacramento is one goofy place.

I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this.    First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides.  The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.    However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices.    In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.    As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

All rights reserved. Copyright Cato Institute Spring 2001  THE FINAL WORD  CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on. They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies.  Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on \"negawatts\" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power.  Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation.  There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002.  This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. You're in California.  Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the \"Information Economy\" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go $12 billion into the red.  California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. \"Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to,\" Davis declaimed.  \"Take\" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices.  Californians want to snatch that money back. \"Consumer advocates around California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,\" reported the January 31 Washington Post. \"They took the money and ran,\" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess.  But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower.  It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too.  R J. O'Rourke is the Cato Institute's H. L. Mencken Research Fellow and is foreign affairs desk chief for Rolling Stone.

In discussing power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the \"forgotten resource\" in more efficient power markets.  There seems to be a lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many researchers need to address some practical but important problems.  I was asked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by policymakers.  Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major sponsor.  I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron that the company might consider providing $25,000.  As you may appreciate, it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the conference is widely circulated among key government groups.

Jeffords has never mattered much to Californians. Until now.        The Vermont senator's widely anticipated  decision to abandon his fellow Republicans and put Democrats in control of  the Senate could have big implications for California, particularly on  energy and environmental policy, lawmakers and lobbyists said Wednesday.        The change, which Jeffords is expected  to announce today, could increase political pressure on the Bush  administration to respond more aggressively to California's electricity  crisis, these insiders said.       And it  might force the White House to compromise on key elements of the national  energy policy it unveiled last week. In fact, the administration's  proposed budget cuts for programs to promote renewable energy were said to  be a factor in Jeffords' decision.       At  the very least, Senate observers said, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is  likely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for  wholesale electricity.       That doesn't  necessarily mean that the administration's critics will be able to have  everything their way. Even if the Senate approves electricity price caps,  for example, the measure would face stiff opposition in the GOP-dominated  House--and a likely veto if it made it to the president's desk.        Still, a Democratic majority in the  Senate would give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up  the political heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on  energy policy.       \"It kicks up the dust,\"  groaned one energy industry lobbyist who requested anonymity.        Observed Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.):  \"If President Bush's hard-edged conservative approach has in fact caused  the balance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate, it will have  profound implications not just for California, but for the environment and  our nation's energy policy.\"        Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as  they contemplated the possible impact of Jeffords' decision on the  policies they care about.       All of a  sudden, they said, it seems less likely that oil exploration will take  place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, that recreational  snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park, or that  the administration's desire to promote nuclear power will be embraced by  Congress.       On the other hand, it seems  more probable that Congress would approve a new plan for managing a vast  swath of the Sierra Nevada to protect the region's oldest trees, consider  legislation to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and  protect California from a resurgence of offshore oil drilling.        \"It's stunning how broad the  repercussions are, particularly on the environment,\" said Gregory Wetstone  of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"We're trying not to count our  chickens before they hatch. But it will be easier for us in our battles at  least to keep from moving backwards.\"        For instance, Jeffords is a chief  advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power plants.  And if events play out as expected, he'll become the new chairman of the  Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue.        Another issue under his purview would be  the two-decade dispute over a proposed repository for the nation's spent  nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.        \"Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey,\"  declared Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society.        Environmentalists had been worried that  a number of pro-development provisions would be packed into appropriation  bills. But with Democratic senators in charge, that would become less of a  threat, they said.       \"Every wacko idea  Republicans have will get a higher level of scrutiny,\" Francis said.        The biggest change would be the power of  Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committees,  and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes.        As part of a new Democratic majority,  Feinstein and fellow California Democrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain  leverage with the administration on a number of issues considered  important to the state.       \"That translates  into more federal assistance for California across the board,\" predicted  Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.        \"I think it means more attention to our  state, for sure,\" Boxer said. \"Right now, the president doesn't seem to  give a darn. They're all looking at California as a Democratic state.  They're not interested.\"       Feinstein, who  has been unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy  crisis, may get better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes  more important to the administration. She has been regarded as a  bridge-builder who worked effectively with Republicans in the past.        \"This has not been a warm and friendly  administration,\" she complained Wednesday. \"They've got people who know  all the answers and don't want to listen.\"        The White House disputed that. In fact,  Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during the president's first  visit to California next week.       Under a  Democratic majority, Feinstein would be in line to chair two  subcommittees: the military construction panel of the Senate  Appropriations Committee, and the technology, terrorism and government  information subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.        Boxer would be in line to chair the  subcommittee on Superfund, waste control and risk assessment, and the  Foreign Relations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism.        Maviglio predicted that the effects of  Jeffords' expected party defection would be felt immediately.        The chairmanship of the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H.  Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has been \"openly hostile to California's  plight,\" and handed to Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), who supports Davis' request  for electricity price controls, according to Maviglio.        Democrats have assailed Bush's energy  plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side. With Democrats in charge  of the Senate, the administration would be more likely to compromise,  perhaps beefing up funding for Democrat-supported causes such as increased  energy assistance to low-income households and more aggressive promotion  of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.

RABIN and DARYL KELLEY, TIMES  STAFF WRITERS  The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a  preliminary inquiry into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray  Davis used inside information to trade stocks of power companies doing  business with the state, a source with knowledge of the matter said  Monday.  The federal agency began its review late last week, the  source said, in response to a request from California Secretary of State  Bill Jones. A Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading  by consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling  based on information not available to the public.  On Friday, top  aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been fired for  possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and their  personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital  Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions about who  in the administration owns energy stocks.  Financial disclosure  records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, show that he  owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company he and his boss have  accused of making \"obscene\" profits while California has been \"on its  knees.\" Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based Enron Corp. in  1996.  \"It's not a crime to own energy stock,\" Maviglio  said.  He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp.,  which has the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power  contracts.  Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one  day after San Jose's mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial  Calpine plant favored by the governor and others. Under the terms of  Maviglio's purchase, the transaction was completed about three weeks later  when the stock reached $40 a share, a value of $12,000. It has since  fallen in value.  \"I viewed it as a good long-term investment,\"  Maviglio said, adding that he purchased the shares for his retirement  account based on publicly available information.  The Davis  administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms that it  has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But  California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many  energy merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.  The  fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from  several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records  show.  Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs  secretary Barry Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that  he recently held between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state  company accused of multimillion-dollar price gouging.  In a  statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after he  began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were  supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker  failed to do so.  In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of  State Jones said the governor must do more to ensure the public that its  interest comes first.  \"The governor should direct all of his staff  to immediately file updated conflict of interest statements that reflect  current holdings and any activity since their last statement of economic  interest was filed,\" said Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for  governor.  Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems  comes as the governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for  the quick and broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him  through the crisis.  In his written request to the SEC, Jones said  that recently filed disclosure documents showed that at least one  consultant bought and sold shares of two energy companies within the same  month, raising \"a red flag\" about the possibility of insider  trading.  State law prohibits officials from participating in  decisions involving their personal financial interests.  The five  consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,  delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was  not clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether  the agency's review would result in any charges.  Two of the former  traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by federal  investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider  trading.  But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery  why so many of his colleagues owned Calpine stock.  Mead said he  bought it 2 1\/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended it to his  colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the now-defunct  California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not traded on  that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.  Mead  and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and  March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying  power for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired  traders Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the  date of their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state  required to be filed only two weeks ago.  \"But I'm sure they bought  it while they were still at the power exchange, because that's when we  discussed it,\" Mead said. \"It was kind of like a hobby. I'm sure it wasn't  done with the intent to manipulate.\"  Former trader Elaine Griffin,  who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two weeks ago to take another  job, said she didn't know she owned energy securities until she checked  with her financial advisor July 13, just before leaving her state  job.  Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of  Calpine stock in individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor,  who bought the stock Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after  research found it to be a good investment.  \"I kind of feel like  we've been used for political reasons,\" Griffin said. \"We would have  disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked.\"  As a  trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the state,  but only at market prices.  Meanwhile, two Democratic political  consultants, who helped Davis polish his image after the ongoing energy  crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet, have agreed to accept no  payment for their work as part of an out-of-court settlement of a taxpayer  lawsuit.  Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist  Lewis Uhler, said the settlement was reached last Friday after  negotiations with lawyers for communications consultants Mark Fabiani and  Chris Lehane.  \"Now they will not receive one red cent,\" said  Hiltachk. \"Very simply Mr. Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all  activities for the governor, to accept no payments for their services and  to basically get out of the consulting business with the  governor.\"  As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler  withdrew his lawsuit Monday morning.  Uhler had filed a lawsuit  against the two consultants and Controller Kathleen Connell in June  contending that they should not receive any payments because of a conflict  of interest. The two men also did consulting work for financially troubled  Southern California Edison, which was seeking help from Davis and the  Legislature.  Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who  has been at odds with Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the  payments pending the outcome of the lawsuit.  Under an agreement  with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a month for six  months.  Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for  comment.  *  Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Virginia  Ellis in Sacramento and Robert J. Lopez in Los Angeles contributed to this  story.
