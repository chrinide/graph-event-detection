These recommendations are informed by the fact that I don't feel Anjam has  much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from  Enron:  HR-type stuff: 1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for  him to remain on the floor. 2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know  our positions and curves next.  IT-type stuff: 1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the  group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more  than a day or two. 2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals  over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has  deleted. 3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records  of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried  about code\/data he may have zipped up and mailed out. 4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from  Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.

Clark ambient rating increase from 100% torque at 100degF to 108% torque at 40degF.  I realize that this rating is weather dependent, but the horsepower is available if weather temperatures permit.09To obtain ambient rating as ambient temperatures permit, three unit modifications would have to be implemented; these might be handled by unit control programming only.  Clark allows ambient rating when jacket water and lube oil temperatures can be driven down proportionally to 135 and 125 degF respectively.  Jacket water and lube oil control valves may be needed to reduce jacket water and lube oil temperature as ambient temperature permits, and unit control programs would require modification to accommodate ambient ratings. 09There may be environmental emission issues such as permitting the site for the higher horsepower.  Also, previous checks with Legal indicated these units could operate in the ambient rated zone if the units were purchased with this capability; ambient rating capability was part of the original purchase and stated as such in the unit purchase orders.09Again, I am just making sure everyone is aware of the unit capability at Station 4.

Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 12\/28\/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12\/28\/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12\/28\/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12\/28\/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith  , WR JAC - R-Diddy Updated 12\/28\/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 12\/28\/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 12\/28\/01 Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 12\/28\/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash  , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 12\/28\/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12\/28\/01 Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 12\/28\/01 A banged-up Smith Toe\/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 12\/28\/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's \"full strength\" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 12\/28\/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. \"Still questionable,\" coach Bill Cowher said. \"He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day.\"   Doug Brien , K IND - Free Agent Updated 12\/28\/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the c! lu! b wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Hurricanes Updated 12\/28\/01 According to the Pro Football News and Injury Report, Green has asthma, but he has practiced fully this week and will start against the Vikings.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 12\/27\/01 Thrash is listed as questionable with an ankle injury, but he is expected to play against the Giants.   Patrick Jeffers  , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place.   Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - El-Gato Updated 12\/27\/01 Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week.   Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Perrito-style Updated 12\/27\/01 Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12\/27\/01 The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Beegs Boys Updated 12\/27\/01 Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12\/27\/01 Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week.

","27.0":"George-  Here is one statistical method (linear regression), applied to Hosanna's fund  giving. The method is deterministic, where contributions each Sunday are  attempted to be explained by significant events on the church's and members'  calendars, and the method shoudl be considered in contrast to an anecdotal  one, where each Sunday's giving might be estimated to be the average giving  of the same Sunday (e.g., each 2nd Sunday in January) in the past.  The following effects are estimated independently by the computer (they add  and subtract with each other accordingly; some Sundays can have more than one  effect \"in play\"):  1) most positive for giving: an additional +$8,802 for special pastoral  appeals (3 of them in the past 3 years)  2) positive for giving: an additional +$2,551 Easter and nearest- Christmas  \"Sunday,\" an additional +$59 Thanksgiving Sunday, and a tiny additional +$1  each week pure time trend.  3) negative for giving: -$304 for Sundays of Monday Federal Holiday weekends,  and -$9 during the Summer (June 1-Aug 31)  4) \"wave\": there  is an $80 per week \"wave\"- giving $80 higher one week, $80  lower the next, etc ...  The computer can explain roughly 60% of the absolute variation in giving the  past 3 years using this approach. Keep in mind, much of the information,  statistically, is captured in the pastoral appeals, Easter and Christmas  Sundays, and Holiday weekends. The rest of the variation cannot be explained  by this simple model (i.e., it looks like \"noise\").  Here are the predictions for fund giving for the upcoming year.

","39.0":"As you know, Bridgeline submitted an RFP to the top gas marketing and pipeline companies in North America requesting proposals on a package of bundled transportation and storage capacity.  I am pleased to announce that as a result of that RFP, on Friday May 24th, Bridgeline executed definitive agreements with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC on a three year deal to provide storage and transportation services to be effective June 1, 2002.  This contract, providing 135,000 dt\/day of pipeline capacity and 2.25 bcf of storage capacity represents a substantial portion of the new storage and related transportation capacity associated with the new NS#1 storage cavern we are completing at Napoleonville this month.  We are looking forward to the long-term relationship this contract will establish with such a prominent industry player as Duke.  I would like to congratulate Rich and Tiffany in generating and negotiating the terms of this deal and managing the whole RFP process, Georgia for her many hours in developing the appropriate contract language and Trevor in resolving the significant credit terms and many others in their support - all completed and coordinated on a very aggressive schedule.  Now we must effectively move into the support and delivery of these services where all of Bridgeline will have significant impact.  There will be several meetings scheduled shortly to roll out the details of the contracts to the various groups.  With the previously executed storage contracts recently negotiated with Oneok (1 bcf) and Cinergy (1.25 bcf), Bridgeline has made a quick jump on its 2002 storage plan.  These new agreements will generate higher levels of transactions and service requests from term customers and a need for increased diligence, support and communication.    Thank you for all your efforts and commitment which will continue to drive Bridgeline's success.  Hugh H. Connett Vice President Marketing and Gas Supply Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.

I hope 2002 is finding all of you healthy and happy. Angela, the girls, and I are well settled now in Katy, TX and enjoying our new home.  I am writing all of you because of an event in which I will be participating next month:  The Houston AIDS Walk 2002.  I am asking that you assist me in doing all we can to ensure a future without this tragic disease.  I (and hopefully the girls) will be walking 3.5 miles on Mar 10 representing everyone who chooses to sponsor me (this is where you all come in).  After having my own children, I have become much more aware of and sensitive to causes that I believe can positively impact the lives of children not as fortunate as mine.  The tragedy of this disease and the impact it has on children has motivated me to reach out to all of you in my efforts to do my part for this cause.  In addition to the $100 I plan to donate, I hope to raise $1000 for this event.  If I can get just 40 people to donate $25 each I will have met this goal. The proceeds from the walk will benefit the AIDS Foundation Houston and its partner agencies.  Any amount you can donate would be greatly appreciated. If you are unable to pledge at this time, please join me in learning more about this horrible epidemic.  The more we all know about it, the better we can help eliminate it.  You can pledge by simply replying to this email with the amount you intend to donate.  I will then contact all that have pledged individually to determine payment options\/timing.  Thank you some much for your time.  Best Regards, Brad McDonald   ===== Angela & Brad McDonald ABMcDon@yahoo.com  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry. Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf\/d to 5 Bcf\/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes.  The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt\/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt\/d.  Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.  Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR. DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.  A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.  The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt\/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC. DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.   DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf\/d of transport. Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink. DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt\/d, for one year starting 11\/1\/01.  DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents). DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.  The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.  This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect. ","54.0":"I made a couple of other changes and have no problem posting it.

The most direct method of handling the gas is to have ENA sell the gas & the proceeds directly flow back to ECS (if that is possible).  ECS doesn't want the gas sale to  roll into the ENA bankruptcy process.  Otherwise ENA would need to assign ECS the ability to sell the gas directly but ECS would then need to execute a TW Pooling Agreement (or something) and there may be issues with ECS marketing gas directly.

My wife has been                     with ENRON for fifteen years eversince she came out of U of H . Our hearts bleed ENRON blood and they were wounded deeply last                     Friday night when we saw you on TV announcing the sale of ENRON to Dynergy . We are and still very grateful to all the good things                      that ENRON has provided to our family ( we have three children) and feel so blessed to be associated with such a caring and generous                     company .                       Mr Lay , we love you , respect you and most of all we trust you to do everything in your power to help to save ENRON and in process                      all of its employees . Our hearts were broken when we saw your face in that Friday announcement . The stress of giving up \"your child\"                      away can be devastated and I think you have aged greatly the last three weeks or so . The stress impact was almost the same as that                       which I saw on Mr . Michael Cappellas as he announced the sale of Compaq to HP sometimes ago . Please beleive us we felt this way                       whether you gave back the 60 millions or not . ( I felt you deserve the money because under your leadership ENRON has growthed                        tremendously the last fifteen years or so and hence all the people here including the critics have the jobs that they currently have and                         99.99 % of them would have taken the money anyway besides that what are the reasonable compensation to a leader that have tripled                        or quadrupled shareholders values ?. Look at Michael Eisner , Larry Orvitz and dozen other Fortune 500 CEO 's compensation including                         those that have not added any values to their respective companies during their tenure and they will see your compensation are justified .                              Throughout the years we saw so many changes at ENRON and most disturbing fact is the expenses ( G & A ,outside contractors ,consultant ...)                        go up thru the roof . Since I am a contractor  I knew how much ENRON paid for such services , me and my wife were trying to do our parts by she                        wrote and sent an e-mail to Mr Rick Causey suggesting ways to cut down outside contractor 's cost because whatever the savings will be                        reflected directly to the bottom lines .                                                 Mr Lay , whatever happened we will allways trust you to steer ENRON into the right path and we truly wish you Health ,Prosperity and                         Happiness to you and your family . Thank you for reading this e-mail . Sincerely , Joseph Nguyen .
