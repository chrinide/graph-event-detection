[{"body":" China\u2019s Huayi Brothers Media Corp. agreed to a three-year film-financing deal with STX Entertainment, a startup studio founded by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds and TPG Capital Management. The accord lets the Los Angeles-based   increase the number of movies it makes to 12 to 15 a year from 8 to 10 by 2016, as well as bolster its distribution in China, the companies said in a statement Wednesday. The deal also enables STX to spend $1 billion a year producing, marketing and distributing its films worldwide. The venture is the latest example of Hollywood deal making by Chinese investors, as the nation\u2019s movie market continues to expand and is   to become the world\u2019s biggest by 2020. The partners said it was the first time a Chinese company would be involved in all production, marketing and distribution of U.S films. \u201cThis deal will help Huayi Brothers access the Hollywood film industry, with participation in all segments including film financing, production and distribution,\u201d Dennis Wang, chief executive officer and a founder of Huayi Brothers, said in the statement. Terms weren\u2019t disclosed. Hony Capital, the Chinese private-equity firm, is another investor in the studio. Donald Tang, managing partner of Tang Media Partners and a former vice chairman of Bear Stearns Cos., facilitated the deal, according to Simonds. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason so many deals in Hollywood make sense and are announced and never actually consummated and for me the secret is they don\u2019t have that person who really brings it together,\u201d Simonds said of Tang in an interview. Simonds, whose producing credits include the Adam Sandler comedies \u201cBig Daddy\u201d and \u201cThe Waterboy,\u201d said the studio would spend about $75 million on each film, including $35 million in marketing costs. STX Entertainment has debt financing underwritten by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. Huayi will co-fund, co-produce and co-distribute almost all STX Entertainment films through 2017, and share in global revenue, according to the statement. Huayi has first-look distribution deal in China on most STX Entertainment films. The projects include \u201cThe Free State of Jones,\u201d which features Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey and is scheduled for release next year, and the thriller \u201cThe Gift,\u201d produced by Jason Blum and starring Jason Bateman, which hits theaters in July. The studio was set up last year, in partnership with producer Gigi Pritzker, and has hired senior executives including Oren Aviv, formerly at 21st Century Fox Inc.\u2019s film unit, as president and chief content officer for motion pictures, and Adam Fogelson, a former chairman of Universal Pictures\u2019 film business, as chairman of the motion-picture unit. The deal with Huayi Brothers is the latest Chinese partnership in Hollywood. The largest remains Dalian Wanda Group\u2019s 2012 acquisition of exhibitor AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. for $2.6 billion including debt. Last year, Fosun International Ltd., controlled by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, invested in Studio 8, founded by former Warner Bros. Pictures president Jeff Robinov. Those films will be distributed by Sony Corp. \u201cThis deal represents a growing partnership between Hollywood and China,\u201d Lindsay Conner, a partner at law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and adviser to Huayi Brothers on the deal, said in an interview. \u201cAfter a number of years when more was said than done, we are starting to see deals closing.\u201d By distributing its own films, STX Entertainment distinguishes itself from other production companies. It has direct distribution agreements with the largest North American theater chains, including Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment, Cinemark Holdings Inc. and Carmike Cinemas Inc. \u201cThis is literally just the tip of the iceberg of many other deals that we are going to be doing in other streaming and digital spaces with other major players in China,\u201d Simonds said.","timestamp":1427892874.0,"participant_ids":["300027:CH","8818Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-01\/huayi-brothers-form-partnership-with-tpg-backed-hollywood-studio","subject":"Huayi Brothers Partner With TPG-Backed Hollywood Studio"},{"body":"Staples Inc.\u00a0will have to do more to smooth government opposition to its proposed takeover of Office Depot Inc. after the U.S. rejected its latest attempt to win antitrust approval. Staples offered to transfer commercial contracts worth up to $1.25 billion, up from $500 million previously, but still failed to sway antitrust officials, the company said in a statement Monday. The rejection by the Federal Trade Commission raises the stakes for Staples and Office Depot, which have said a drawn-out administrative challenge will kill the deal. The FTC says that the tie-up of the No. 1 and No. 2 office-supply retailers will eliminate competition and raise prices for corporate customers that purchase under contract.\u00a0 The two companies forged the merger, which was announced in February, under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value. Staples Chief Executive Officer Ron Sargent said at the time the transaction would help it cope with a changing competitive environment and save at least $1 billion in costs. The FTC\u00a0filed an antitrust   against the transaction Dec. 7 and will ask a federal judge to block the deal at a trial set to begin March 21 in Washington. It\u2019s the second time in nearly 20 years the agency has sued to stop a tie-up between the two companies. The FTC won that   in 1997. In 2013, it   Office Depot\u2019s takeover of OfficeMax, leading some to believe it wouldn\u2019t challenge a new Staples bid for Office Depot. Antitrust opposition to the\u00a0$6.3 billion deal comes amid a merger wave sweeping across industries from beer to drug stores to pharmaceuticals that are under scrutiny from officials at the FTC and the Justice Department. At a court hearing last week, FTC lawyer\u00a0Tara Reinhart said the agency has told the companies that it\u2019s concerned that they are merely transferring contracts and not divesting physical assets. If the FTC just wants physical assets such as distribution centers sold, that may make a settlement easier than if it\u2019s also worried about the ability of the buyer to compete effectively, said Jennifer Rie, an antitrust analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. \"If it\u2019s just a matter of more assets, then a settlement is likely doable here,\" she said. The FTC is seeking a federal court injunction against the deal pending a trial in its administrative court, which is scheduled to begin in May. Office Depot lawyer Matt Reilly reiterated at last week\u2019s hearing that the deal can\u2019t survive past the federal court process. Staples shares were little changed at $9.39 at 1:13 p.m. in New York. Office Depot was down 1 percent to $5.35. Staples said in its statement that it\u2019s willing to continue negotiations with the FTC to reach a settlement that addresses its concerns. The\u00a0Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said it would contest the FTC\u2019s lawsuit in court in order to complete the transaction. \u201cThe company is confident in its legal position and looks forward to a full and impartial judicial review of the matter,\u201d Staples said in the statement.\u00a0 An FTC spokeswoman declined to comment. Kirk Saville, a spokesman for Staples, didn\u2019t respond to requests for additional comment.","timestamp":1450700467.0,"participant_ids":["SPLS:US","ODP:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-21\/staples-says-it-s-offered-to-divest-1-25-billion-in-contracts","subject":"FTC Rejects Staples-Office Depot Deal Without a Counteroffer"},{"body":"EQT Partners AB has emerged as a strong contender to buy Swiss travel services company Kuoni Reisen Holding AG, according to people familiar with the matter. The Swedish buyout firm is competing with other financial investors to take Kuoni private, said the people, who asked not to be identified because talks are confidential. Kuoni hasn\u2019t made a final decision on whether to sell, the people said. It has a market value of about 1.2 billion francs ($1.2 billion). The company said Tuesday it received preliminary approaches from third parties for a possible offer, without naming them. Kuoni has announced job cuts and a management shakeup as it works to turn around its money-losing Global Travel Services division. The company said in November it had   its chief executive officer and that the board had proposed eliminating voting-rights limits in a move that analysts said would make the company easier to take over. Discussions with possible bidders are at a preliminary stage and there\u2019s no certainty an offer will be made, Kuoni said, adding it\u2019s considering all other options. Representatives for EQT declined to comment. Kuoni shares rose 1.7 percent to 294 francs as of 9:23 a.m. in Zurich Tuesday after reaching its highest intraday price since June. The stock is little changed over the past 12 months. There\u2019s a risk the board wouldn\u2019t agree with Kuoni\u2019s shareholders on a takeover, Michael Romer, an analyst at J.

The judge overseeing Fuhu\u2019s case said he will approve rules for an auction this month in which an affiliate of Norman\u2019s fund will make the opening bid of $10 million -- $500,000 more than Mattel had said it would pay when El Segundo, California-based Fuhu filed for bankruptcy in December. The ruling sets up a potential shootout between an affiliate of the Australian golfer\u2019s Great White Shark Enterprises and El Segundo-based Mattel, maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars. \u201cThe two parties who are most interested in the assets are probably already at the table,\u201d U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi said Tuesday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. Norman, 60, was the first person in professional golf to surpass $10 million in career earnings, according to his website. He captured the British Open Championship in 1986 and 1993 and has 91 wins around the world, including 20 on the PGA Tour. Fuhu sought creditor protection in December with a plan to sell itself to Mattel unless a higher bid came in. Before the auction even began, Norman\u2019s GWS Fuhu LLC topped Mattel\u2019s opening offer and agreed to lend Fuhu $2 million to pay down certain liens that could have disrupted a sale. Sontchi approved the loan and said he will sign an order setting the auction rules once final wording is worked out by lawyers.

Noble Group Ltd. has lost almost two-thirds of its value, with its stock trading near the lowest since 2008, after a year of attacks on its finances by critics including the anonymous Iceberg Research and short-seller Muddy Waters LLC. The latest blow, amid a rout in raw materials, was the cut in its credit rating to junk by Moody\u2019s Investors Service on concerns over its liquidity. It\u2019s a downgrade that will test Chief Executive Officer Yusuf Alireza\u2019s view that while an investment-grade rating is desirable, it isn\u2019t required for the business, as Standard & Poor\u2019s also reviews its assessment. Moody\u2019s decision comes a week after the Hong Kong-based company agreed to sell the rest of its agriculture unit to Cofco Corp. for at least $750 million. While the deal may help the company to cut debt, its liquidity will remain constrained, according to Moody\u2019s, which expects a prolonged commodity slump. \u201cThey have had a really difficult year, not only fighting the commodity slump but also various allegations,\u201d Bernard Aw, a strategist at IG Asia Pte, said by e-mail. \u201cEntering 2016, the performance of Noble will clearly hinge on the recovery in the commodity complex. Noble may continue to offload non-profitable assets, to improve its balance sheet and creditworthiness. These should help it better navigate the challenging landscape.\u201d Noble Group stock fell 9.1 percent to end at 40 Singapore cents on Wednesday, and traded unchanged early Thursday. The shares are 65 percent lower this year and are the biggest losers in the Straits Times Index. The company\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2020, its most liquid, dropped\u00a0on Wednesday to the lowest since they were issued in 2009. After the Noble Agri deal closes, Noble Group\u2019s rating metrics will substantially exceed those required of an investment-grade credit, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Noble Group still has its investment-grade ratings from S&P and Fitch Ratings, spokesman Stephen Brown said in an e-mail, referring to comments made on the company\u2019s last earnings call. He added that its bank covenants aren\u2019t ratings-dependent. \u201cWe are confident that the deal will be approved by our shareholders and will close before the end of February,\u201d Noble Group said in a statement to the Singapore Exchange late on Wednesday. \u201cThe current environment is opportunity-rich and plays to our strengths.\u201d The energy and metals trader joins commodity companies worldwide in suffering from the selloff spurred by an oil glut and the slowest growth for a quarter century in China. Moody\u2019s says weak commodity prices could persist for years, and earlier this month cut Swiss trading house Glencore Plc to its lowest investment-grade rating and placed BHP Billiton Ltd., the largest mining company, under review. Moody\u2019s outlook on Noble\u2019s new Baa3 rating on unsecured bonds is negative given the risks associated with its plans to improve liquidity and the prospect of sustained weakness in prices, the agency said. Noble Group suffers from low profitability and negative cash flow from core operations, excluding the proceeds from asset sales, and its ability to gain consistent access to bond markets is expected to remain constrained, it said. S&P\u2019s rates Noble as BBB-, the lowest investment grade. \u201cLowered credit ratings are commonplace in the resource sector right now, so it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise in Noble\u2019s case -- the key will be how these types of companies respond,\u201d Gavin Wendt, founding director and senior resource analyst at MineLife Pty Ltd. in Sydney, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe key of course is selling businesses that aren\u2019t contributing to profitability right now and generally engaging in a business streamlining process. The one thing we do know is that markets will eventually turn, so groups like Noble will be well placed for recovery when it comes.\u201d The year began with attacks in February by Iceberg, which the company would later say is the vehicle of a disgruntled analyst it fired. The critiques -- all rejected by the company -- included arguments that Noble Group overvalues associate companies, that weak cash flows are offset by unfair valuations of future profits on its contracts, and that the company masks its true debt levels. Noble Group has since filed a lawsuit against the analyst, Arnaud Vagner, while in April Muddy Waters\u2019 founder Carson Block joined the fray by shorting Noble Group, saying the company exists only to borrow money and burn cash and that its debt level is unsustainable. The claims were also rejected by Noble Group. To bolster its defenses, Noble Group bought back shares and promised greater transparency. It has sought to cut debt, focus on its most profitable businesses and generate positive cash flow to restore investors\u2019 confidence, measures that have included an overhaul of its metals unit. In August, it published a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that said its accounting practices complied with international rules in valuing long-term contracts. The same month, it set a target to raise operating profit to more than $2 billion in three-to-five years, while in October it completed a $1.1 billion revolving-credit facility, citing strong support from lenders. In its last quarterly earnings in November, Noble Group reported an 84 percent drop in profit and a 20 percent fall in sales. Still, the company reported that tonnages handled were a record, margins rose and that cash flow from operations had turned positive. In August, Alireza reflected on the company\u2019s travails, telling Bloomberg Television that \u201cat the end of it we will be a better firm.\u201d As 2016 looms, there\u2019s still no end to the pressure on its business.","timestamp":1451447520.0,"participant_ids":["NOBL:SP","MCO:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-30\/noble-group-ends-a-turbulent-year-with-cut-to-junk-from-moody-s","subject":"Noble Group Ends a Turbulent Year With Cut to Junk From Moody's"},{"body":"BMW held on to the U.S. luxury-auto sales crown even with a 17 percent drop in December deliveries, nosing out Lexus and Mercedes-Benz as carmakers\u00a0roared to a record year. The final annual tally was 346,023 for BMW AG\u2019s namesake brand, 344,601 for Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s Lexus and 343,088 for Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes. The 3.8 percent December gain for Lexus was enough for the brand to slip ahead of Mercedes, which posted a 0.6 percent increase. The German automakers have held the top spot in U.S. luxury sales since 2011, when BMW ended Lexus\u2019s 11-year reign. The premium brands, like the industry overall, benefited in 2015 from low gasoline prices, available credit and a strengthening labor market. Lexus used a 26 percent surge in deliveries of sport utility vehicles to almost reclaim the yearly title. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe the market will go south\u201d this year, Ludwig Willisch, head of BMW\u2019s North American unit, said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cGas prices will continue to be low, interest rates are still low, and at BMW we have a lot of cars with three-year leases coming back.\u201d The BMW brand set a sales record for the third year in a row, \u201cwith the numbers further emphasizing the growth of light trucks, which are now one-third of BMW sales in the U.S.,\u201d Willisch said in a statement. BMW reported a 16 percent gain for full-year truck deliveries. BMW reported December sales of 34,625, led by the X5 and strong growth in its M models. Lexus monthly deliveries climbed to 41,380, including gains of 77 percent each for the NX and LX sport utilities. Mercedes\u2019s new GLE and GLC models contributed to total December sales of 34,203. The results exclude BMW\u2019s Mini models and Daimler\u2019s work trucks and Smart cars, which aren\u2019t luxury vehicles. Industrywide December   of 1.64 million cars and light trucks pushed the yearly total to 17.5 million, according to Autodata Corp. That beat the previous annual record of 17.4 million, set in 2000.\u00a0 Among other luxury brands, Honda Motor Co.\u2019s Acura\u00a0for the year outsold General Motor Co.\u2019s Cadillac for the first time since 2012. Acura reported a monthly drop of 5.5 percent to 16,823 vehicles for an annual total of 177,165, up 5.6 percent. The GM brand posted a December increase of 29 percent for full-year sales of 175,267, a gain of 2.6 percent. Tata Motors Ltd.\u2019s Land Rover, spurred by new models and consumers\u2019 preference for SUVs, was the fastest-growing luxury brand in U.S. during 2015, with a 37 percent gain. Land Rover said in a statement that December deliveries increased 47 percent to 8,441, pushing its annual total to 70,582. The brand through November had already beaten its previous yearly sales record. Land Rover added the Discovery Sport model last year, drawing \u201ca new consumer\u201d to the brand, said Chris Marchand, an executive vice president of Jaguar Land Rover North America. The Discovery Sport, which has a starting price of less than $40,000, accounted for 7,611 sales, about 40 percent of Land Rover\u2019s 2015 increase.","timestamp":1452018772.0,"participant_ids":["BMW:GR","7203:JP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-01-05\/bmw-retains-u-s-luxury-sales-title-as-carmakers-cap-record-year","subject":"BMW Keeps U.S. Luxury Sales Title as Carmakers Reach Record"},{"body":"Mercedes-Benz luxury-auto deliveries in the U.S. slid 13 percent in November, allowing BMW to widen its lead going into the final month in the annual sales race. Sales at Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes, which delayed its monthly report a day because of a computer malfunction, fell to 30,043, with a 20 percent decline for cars as consumer tastes shift from luxury sedans to car-based sport utility vehicles. BMW AG\u2019s namesake brand posted a 3.2 percent gain to 32,003, as deliveries of the X3 SUV more than doubled. Lexus rose 6.8 percent to a November record of 29,340, helped by its revamped RX SUV. BMW benefited from the traditional strength of its 3 Series and other car models, plus strong entries such as the X3 in an SUV segment that\u2019s booming now, Michelle Krebs, senior auto analyst at AutoTrader.com, said Tuesday. BMW has been able to withstand the shift from cars to SUVs better than the other top brands. With sales\u00a0of the redesigned flagship 7 Series jumping 48 percent in November to 1,045 and deliveries of the four-door 4 Series Gran Coupe tripling this year, the brand has had balanced growth in 2015: Car sales up 4.3 percent, SUV sales up 4.7 percent. \u201cThe all-new 7 Series did very well in its first full month of sales but there\u2019s no question the trend is towards light trucks,\u201d Ludwig Willisch, chief executive officer of BMW of North America, said Monday in a statement. Improving availability of BMW SUVs \u201cgave a nice boost to our overall sales in November,\u201d he said. Mercedes SUV sales slipped 2 percent last month. The results exclude BMW\u2019s Mini vehicles and Daimler\u2019s work trucks and Smart cars, which aren\u2019t luxury vehicles. Lexus, which hasn\u2019t claimed the annual sales crown since 2010, boosted average incentives 19 percent last month as it started year-end promotions early, according to TrueCar Inc. estimates. The wasn\u2019t enough to gain on BMW, which TrueCar said reduced its spending 3.6 percent from a year earlier, while Mercedes trimmed its discounts 7.4 percent. Lexus still spent less per vehicle than the two rivals. BMW, which captured the sales crown in 2014, through November leads Mercedes by about 2,500 deliveries and Lexus by more than 8,000. Krebs said she wouldn\u2019t rule out a December surge by Lexus, in part because the redesigned RX SUV is just reaching dealers in large numbers. \u201cThe RX dominates the segment and it hasn\u2019t been redone in a while, so there\u2019s tremendous interest in that vehicle,\u201d Krebs said. Lexus, like luxury competitors, enjoyed a surge in SUV sales in November, but its car deliveries slid 17 percent because models such as the IS sedan have gone too long without being refreshed with new technology, said\u00a0Eric Lyman, a TrueCar vice president.","timestamp":1449067005.0,"participant_ids":["BMW:GR","7203:JP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-02\/bmw-s-luxury-sales-lead-in-u-s-widens-over-mercedes-benz-lexus","subject":"BMW's Luxury Sales Lead in U.S. Widens Over Mercedes, Lexus"},{"body":" Hyundai Motor Co. and affiliate Kia Motors Corp. have agreed to pay royalties to a Baltimore company to end a patent-infringement fight over hybrid engines.

The jury also found the infringement was intentional, so the judge could have tripled the jury award. \u201cThis agreement further validates the importance of our technology, and we hope to reach additional agreements with other major automakers,\u201d said Frances Keenan, chairwoman of the Paice\u2019s board of directors. Toyota Motor Co. licensed the technology beginning in 2010 after a long legal   that included attempts to bar U.S. imports of the Prius. Ford Motor Co. licensed one of Paice\u2019s patents under a deal struck in 2010. The two companies agreed not to sue over other patents until Jan. 1, 2014, to provide time to reach a broader settlement. The negotiations with Ford, according to a Paice\u2019s lawsuit filed the following month, were \u201cshort and one-sided.\u201d The suit against Hyundai and Kia was first filed in 2012 by Paice and Baltimore\u2019s  , a non-profit that\u2019s invested in Paice.

Shares of CJ E&M, which owns cable TV channel tvN, doubled in 2015 as it capped a year of hits with a weekly drama called \"Reply 1988.\" The show depicting the lives of high school students during a year of 11.9 percent economic growth and the Seoul Olympics struck a chord with households in an economy reeling from 11 months of slumping exports. The \" \" of popular culture that spans drama, K-Pop music, fashion and cosmetics boosted a range of stocks last year as companies around Asia sought co-productions or product tie-ins.

CJ E&M drew an audience of 13 million for a nostalgic movie \"Ode To My Father,\" which describes a man born after the 1950-53 Korean War who had to support his family by working as a laborer in a German coal mine and participating in the Vietnam War. Confectionery makers, apparel brands and even brewery companies rode the trend with retro-themed chocolates, jackets, and beers. \"People buy items that remind them of past memories, and stores and supermarkets are marketing those products,\" Kim said. \"The nostalgia for the past is the biggest factor for their consumption.\" The Kospi index climbed 0.6 percent at the close on Tuesday. Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy, where exports account for about 50 percent of gross domestic product, has slowed amid a slump in global demand. Inflation near 1 percent over the past year shows domestic consumption remains stagnant.

NH Investment\u2019s Lee said valuations of such stocks are heavily affected by the success or failure of their productions in the short-term. CJ E&M and Showbox have price to estimated earnings ratios of about 30, while Chorokbaem is making losses, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \"Unlike CJ E&M, which is a subsidiary of the chaebol CJ Corp., most Korean media stocks are small-sized companies,\" said Lee. \"Even if they forge a partnership with Chinese companies and succeed in their productions, uncertainties still remain among some investors over whether the success would effectively lead to profitability or not.\" CJ E&M has released a series of films with Chinese companies, including \"A Wedding Invitation\" produced with China Film Group Corp. \"China has the world\u2019s second-largest content market and the size will surpass the U.S. market within five years,\" said\u00a0Mike Suh, vice president in the Global Business Department at CJ E&M. \"While keeping the value of the Korean Wave, developing competitive contents there is our goal in cooperation with Chinese partners.\" The entertainment sector is one of the few sectors unaffected by global economic slowdown as Korea\u2019s consumer power has grown enough to support the industry, according to Justin Lee, analyst at BNP Paribas Securities. CJ E&M has recently been added to the MSCI Korea Index, while heavyweight manufacturers including Doosan Infracore Co. and LS Industrial Systems Co. were removed. \"Exporting content is the old style of the Korean Wave,\" said Lee. \"Developing content with overseas partners or expanding investment in Asia, not only China, is the only way to achieve growth as the domestic market is too limited.\"","timestamp":1451912460.0,"participant_ids":["001040:KS","300027:CH"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-01-04\/1980s-boom-years-living-on-in-korea-s-outperforming-media-stocks","subject":"1980s Boom Years Living On in Korea's Outperforming Media Stocks"},{"body":"Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s profit miss is the latest sign the global smartphone market is running out of steam, spelling trouble for the suppliers of displays, semiconductors and other components that go into mobile devices. The world\u2019s largest maker of displays and memory chips, which sells to Apple Inc. and many other brands, posted fourth-quarter profit that fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates as sales remained sluggish over the holiday season.\u00a0Demand is\u00a0waning for smartphones as markets mature and China\u2019s economy slows, pressuring profit margins at Samsung. Concerns that the smartphone market is fizzling out has spurred analysts to trim estimated demand, which in turn has   device vendors as well as suppliers of components and contract assemblers. Apple, which garners most of the industry\u2019s profits, ended Thursday   for the first time in over a year after investment brokerages from   AG to Morgan Stanley lowered forecasts on iPhone shipments. \u201cI see no signs of a recovery in demand for electronics products which only means the component businesses will remain pressured,\u201d said Song Myung Sup, a Seoul-based analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co. \u201cThe situation is only getting worse and the first-quarter earnings will likely be even lower than the fourth quarter.\u201d Samsung\u2019s operating income was 6.1 trillion won ($5 billion) in the three months ended December, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said in preliminary results released on Friday. That compares with the 6.64 trillion-won average of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were 53 trillion won in the quarter, little changed from a year earlier, the company said. Samsung won\u2019t provide net income or break out the results of various divisions until it releases audited results later this month. The result comes just days after Co-Chief Executive Officer Kwon Oh Hyun warned of escalating competition and urged employees to find ways to safeguard its lead now that software and platforms are eclipsing hardware. Samsung phone shipments are headed for their second straight annual decline in the wake of tougher competition from Apple in the high-end segment to China\u2019s Xiaomi Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. for budget consumers. Yet even Xiaomi, which rose from obscurity to become the country\u2019s biggest phone brand, may have   its 80-million unit sales target in 2015, people with knowledge of its production plans have said. Samsung shares finished 0.7 percent higher in Seoul. The stock has dropped about 7 percent in the first trading week of 2016 after posting three straight annual declines. The \u201cshare increase today doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a brighter future but it suggests that Samsung, which sells both sets and component products, has at least fared better than other pure component rivals,\u201d said Claire Kim, an analyst at Daishin Securities Co. in Seoul. Largan Precision Co. Ltd., which gets more than a quarter of its sales from Apple, this week said sales in December dropped 31 percent from a year earlier. Catcher Technology Co. expects little growth in the first half on weaker demand from Apple, Nikkei reported. While Samsung has been able to boost chip sales volumes, the price of memory is falling. Operating income at the semiconductor business, the company\u2019s biggest profit generator, probably rose about 20 percent to 3.3 trillion won in the fourth quarter on sales of 12.7 trillion won, according to the median estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Samsung has shifted focus toward chips and displays and sought more external clients to help make up for declining growth in its own phones and TVs. The company is spending 15.6 trillion won on a new plant in South Korea with semiconductor production forecast to start next year. Operating profit at the mobile unit was probably 2.18 trillion won in the quarter,\u00a0according to the analyst survey, largely helped by growth in shipments of cheaper Galaxy smartphones such as the A and J series. Longer term, the company has signaled a potential shift in its strategic thrust. Vice Chairman Lee Jae Yong, heir apparent to South Korea\u2019s biggest conglomerate, last month   the head of its mobile business as part of an annual management overhaul, signaling a change in direction to focus on software innovations. New phone head Koh Dong Jin worked on Samsung\u2019s new payments service and its Knox security software. \u201cQuite apart from Samsung Galaxy models, today\u2019s results also suggest that the market can no longer rely on die-hard demand for iPhones in the high-end category as well,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat surely pressured key component suppliers, including Samsung. The more consumers choose to buy cheaper phones, the more price pressure on components powering those devices.\u201d","timestamp":1452202600.0,"participant_ids":["005930:KS","AAPL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-01-07\/samsung-profit-misses-estimates-on-falling-chip-display-prices","subject":"Samsung's Earnings Miss Underlines Sputtering Global Demand"},{"body":"The $1.4 trillion lost in global mining stocks since 2011 exceeds the total market value of Apple Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc.

Hoping to keep viewers who are dropping cable subscriptions for online streaming services, Time Warner is negotiating to make full seasons of more shows available to pay-TV customers on demand, according to Time Warner Chief Financial Officer Howard Averill. Time Warner\u2019s cable networks, which include TNT and TBS, have \u201cmade it clear\u201d to Hollywood studios that they want so-called \u201cstacking rights,\u201d or the ability to air full seasons of shows they buy, Averill said. Meanwhile, Time Warner\u2019s Warner Bros. studio recently sold a new show, \u201cLucifer,\u201d to 21st Century Fox Inc., that allows cable subscribers to view the entire first season on demand -- the first time that Warner Bros. has granted full-season rights to a broadcast network, he said. \u201cYou are starting to see momentum,\u201d Averill said Thursday at a Citigroup Inc. media conference in Las Vegas. \u201cWe have to continue to move along that path to make sure we provide the consumer what they\u2019re looking for.\u201d After Time Warner and Fox executives signaled last fall they were   their Netflix strategies -- Fox said it would sell more content to Hulu -- Averill\u2019s comments offered detail on what Time Warner plans to do. Investors have become concerned that TV producers may be jeopardizing the long-term health of the TV industry for lucrative short-term deals with streaming providers like Netflix and Amazon.com Inc., whose popularity is taking viewers away from regular TV watching. By offering consumers the option to\u00a0catch up on shows by binge-watching like they do on streaming services, Time Warner is trying to keep them from dropping traditional pay-TV subscriptions. Currently, cable subscribers can only watch the last five episodes of many shows because studios have sold the exclusive full-season rights to online video services. For years, media companies have promoted a solution called \u201cTV Everywhere\u201d that allows cable subscribers to watch shows on-demand using any device they want. But it has been slow to catch on, partly because consumers often can\u2019t watch full seasons. If media companies want to compete with Netflix, they need to \u201cmake as much content available to consumers as possible,\u201d said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. However, Hollywood studios -- as well as producers and actors -- have been opposed to selling full-season rights to TV networks because Netflix won\u2019t pay as much if full seasons are available through pay-TV distributors. So media companies are likely paying more to studios to acquire full-season rights, Sweeney said. \u201cStacking rights are more important now than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Sweeney said. Netflix didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Time Warner shares increased 2.3 percent to $70.20 Thursday after Averill said the company would end its fiscal year \u201cjust above the high end\u201d of its 2015 earnings forecast range of $4.60 to $4.70 a share. It was the second day in a row that the stock gained more than 2 percent amid a rout in global markets. On Wednesday, Time Warner Inc.   the most in 1 1\/2 years after Credit Suisse predicted the media industry will rebound this year from a disappointing 2015. Time Warner shares fell 24 percent in 2015 as investors became increasingly worried about the impact of cord-cutting on the health of the TV industry.","timestamp":1452197449.0,"participant_ids":["TWX:US","NFLX:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-01-07\/time-warner-pushes-for-binge-watching-rights-to-combat-netflix","subject":"Time Warner Pushes for Binge-Watching Rights to Combat Netflix"},{"body":"Netflix Inc.\u2019s massive expansion of its online movie streaming service to cover 130 countries and territories has one glaring absence: China. Strict controls over content and the need for a local partner to meet licensing restrictions are standing in its way. That\u2019s prompting talks with the nation\u2019s largest Internet companies, including an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., to clear the way for an expansion into a country with more web users than any other. Netflix wants to become the first global online TV service, with its latest expansion adding countries including India and Russia for movies and its own content, including the critically-acclaimed of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d While mainland China offers an online video market\u00a0  to reach about $14 billion within three years, content rules are strict and Internet giants Alibaba,\u00a0Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. offer their own services. When asked why any of China\u2019s three biggest Web operators would be a partner given their competing services, Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said Netflix was in talks with the companies and the government. \u201cOur efforts in China are modest. We\u2019re on a slow and steady path,\u201d Hastings said at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Representatives from Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu weren\u2019t immediately able to comment.

Starting last April, new episodes of foreign programs cannot be shown until after the shows\u2019 seasons have ended,   to a government notice. Episodes need censor approval, as content deemed violent, sexual or offensive to the ruling Communist Party will be cut, according to the notice. Hastings says recent subscription services like DisneyLife, jointly offered by Alibaba and Walt Disney Co., set good examples of how Netflix could expand in China. Netflix stands a better chance to operate in China due to the neutrality of its content, says Hastings. \u201cWe\u2019re not really controversial like a sharing service like YouTube,\u201d said Hastings. \u201cWe\u2019re more like Disney or Starbucks as an entertainment and lifestyle service.\u201d While the company\u2019s expansion excluded mainland China, it did include Hong Kong, which is designated as a special administrative region.","timestamp":1452128222.0,"participant_ids":["NFLX:US","BABA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-01-07\/china-remains-roadblock-to-netflix-s-global-expansion-ambitions","subject":"China Remains Roadblock to Netflix's Global Expansion Ambitions"},{"body":"Bad news for American tech. That was the reaction from many industry watchers in October when Europe\u2019s highest court -- reacting in part to revelations that U.S. intelligence services were vacuuming up the private information of millions of Europeans --\u00a0  a longstanding agreement that this data could be beamed to the U.S. without seeking citizens\u2019 explicit consent. The impact on cloud service providers was expected to be particularly severe because they depend on the seamless global movement of data to sell access to everything from medical records and bank statements to Facebook profiles and photos. Well, a funny thing happened on the way to the Apocalypse. Far from suffering,\u00a0Amazon, Microsoft, VMware and other big U.S. cloud providers say European demand for their services has actually grown since\u00a0the European Court of Justice invalidated the so-called Safe Harbor agreement. U.S.-based cloud providers are luring customers with pledges to keep data far from the prying eyes of American spies by sequestering it in Europe. At the same time, American companies are rushing to have their data-handling policies blessed by European regulators so clients can safely move data around the world. The Safe Harbor ruling \u201chas definitely been an opportunity for us,\u201d said Richard Munro,\u00a0chief European technologist for the vCloud Air service offered by Palo Alto-based VMware. He declined to put an exact figure on sales growth since the Oct. 6 ruling but said his company\u2019s ability to keep customers\u2019 data exclusively in data centers in the U.K. and Germany was a big selling point. Amazon Web Services, the world\u2019s largest cloud provider, is increasingly winning business for its German data centers from non-German customers seeking to place their data under the jurisdiction of what is widely perceived as one of the world\u2019s strictest data protection regulators. Ian Massingham, the company\u2019s London-based \u201ctechnical evangelist,\u201d said demand for these German data centers, located near Frankfurt, has been the fastest growing among any region Amazon has ever launched. This year or next, Amazon plans to open a data storage operation in the U.K., its third European region after Ireland and Germany. The stakes for the U.S. industry are high. The so-called Big Four cloud providers \u2013 Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google \u2013 account for half of all worldwide cloud services, according to Synergy Research Group. They\u2019ve been spending billions on data centers around the globe, including extensive European facilities. Their strong presence in the region has allowed U.S. tech companies to adjust to the Safe Harbor\u00a0ruling. But risks remain because Europe\u2019s data-transfer rules are tricky to comply with and because no one knows what will replace Safe Harbor. The original agreement allowed companies to transfer data to U.S. servers provided they self-certified compliance with seven broad principles, ranging from notifying individuals about what data a company collects to taking reasonable steps to protect data from loss, misuse or unauthorized access or disclosure. The court basically concluded that self-certification wasn\u2019t enough. Even before the ruling, U.S. and European negotiators had been working on a new data transfer agreement, which is supposed to be concluded by the end of the month. There\u2019s no telling, however, if a new pact -- dubbed Safe Harbor 2.0 -- can be hammered out by then or if it will withstand judicial review. \u201cThe core of the problem is not technical but political,\u201d said\u00a0Daniele Catteddu, the Brussels-based director of Europe, Middle East and Africa for the Cloud Security Alliance, an industry group whose members include many of the world\u2019s largest tech firms. \u201cUntil the U.S. has a corresponding data protection authority and a venue where a European citizen can file a complaint if their right to privacy is not respected in the U.S., then data transfers there are going to continue to be a problem.\u201d In the meantime, companies from Google to Amazon must contend with increasingly tough data protection laws. In mid-December, the European Union agreed on a new regulation that will come into force in early 2018 and imposes fines of as much as four percent of a company\u2019s global annual revenue for violations. The rule also makes data processors, which include most cloud service providers, jointly liable with their customers -- the businesses that collect the data -- for any security breaches or mishandling of data. In their pitch to customers, U.S. companies emphasize that they\u2019re relying on EU-suggested contract language and applying for certifications from EU data protection agencies to ensure they don\u2019t run afoul of European laws. BMC Software, a Houston, Texas, company that provides business management software through the cloud, spent three years making sure its data-handling policies passed muster with French regulators. Elodie Dowling, BMC\u2019s vice president and general counsel for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, calls French-sanctioned certification, which is valid throughout the E.U.,\u00a0a\u00a0\u201ccompetitive differentiator\u201d that has drastically sped up sales negotiations. Meanwhile, U.S. companies continue to look for ways of keeping European data out of the reach of the U.S. government. Microsoft, which is contesting a U.S. search warrant for e-mails held on its Irish data servers, came up with a novel solution: storing data in German facilities operated by Deutsche Telekom, which acts as a \u201cdata trustee.\u201d\u00a0 Microsoft declined to make an executive available to comment for this story, but the thinking is that the U.S. wouldn\u2019t be able to subpoena such information from Microsoft. Instead, it would have to approach Deutsche Telekom, which wouldn\u2019t have to comply with a U.S. court -- or so goes the theory. \u201cIt is a good way to make it clear to everyone that Microsoft is trying to protect its customers\u2019 data,\u201d\u00a0said Ann LaFrance, a lawyer specializing in cyber security and data protection issues in the London office of U.S. law firm Squire Patton Boggs. But in practice, she said, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s extensive ties to the U.S. \u2013- the company owns T-Mobile \u2013- mean a U.S. court might well claim jurisdiction, with serious potential consequences for Deutsche Telekom\u2019s U.S. businesses if it chose not to comply. The larger risk is that the world becomes partitioned into data regions, impeding the free flow of information. In a blog post, Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer Brad Smith said a balkanized Internet could mark \u201ca return to the digital dark ages.\u201d He warned that someone trying to buy a product online could have the transaction rejected because the retailer isn\u2019t permitted to transfer credit card information to a payment processor located outside Europe. Or, he said, an airline could reject an online ticket purchase because the carrier couldn\u2019t transmit passport information to the destination\u2019s government. The Safe Harbor ruling has provided a boost to companies such as Microsoft and Amazon --- but that doesn\u2019t mean it was good news for business overall.","timestamp":1452142800.0,"participant_ids":["AMZN:US","MSFT:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-01-07\/amazon-s-pitch-to-europe-your-data-is-safe-from-american-spies","subject":"Amazon's Pitch to Europe: Your Data Is Safe From American Spies"},{"body":"Deutsche Bank AG co-Chief Executive Officer John Cryan is convincing some analysts that he can lift the company\u2019s capital levels without a share sale. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg are the most optimistic on the shares since March after three upgrades this month. Deutsche Bank is \u201coverly discounted\u201d and its capital is probably sufficient, Jeremy Sigee, an analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in a note on Thursday after raising the German lender to overweight from equal weight. Cryan, who took over from Anshu Jain in July, is selling assets, reducing bonuses and plans to suspend the company\u2019s dividend to help to raise capital buffers without tapping shareholders for additional funds. His predecessor sold 11.5 billion euros ($12 billion) of shares in 2013 and 2014 to increase capital levels and fund growth, angering some investors by diluting their holdings. \u201cWe believe share count dilution risk is off the table for Deutsche Bank,\u201d Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. with an overweight recommendation on the shares, wrote in a note on Wednesday. Deustche Bank has slumped about 13 percent in the last year, more than twice the 5.7 percent decline of the 45-member Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index over the same period. The stock fell 3.1 percent to 20.96 euros as of 11:06 a.m. in Frankfurt, giving the bank the lowest price to book ratio of 12 global lenders. Cryan, who previously helped return UBS Group AG to health after a bailout during the financial crisis, told analysts in a call after taking over the job in July that raising additional capital \u201cwould not solve our core problem of reversing our low financial returns and our poor organic capital generation.\u201d In October, Deutsche Bank said it will probably suspend its dividend for two years to help boost the common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, to at least 12.5 percent by the end of 2018. Last month, the lender agreed to sell its 20 percent stake in Huaxia Bank Co. to PICC Property and Casualty Co., raising further capital. Four out of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect Deutsche Bank to surpass its capital target for 2018. On average, the analysts expect the CET1 ratio to rise to 13.6 percent in three years from 11.5 percent at the end of September, the survey shows. Still, Deutsche Bank\u2019s past efforts to lift capital levels didn\u2019t prove to be sufficient. While a\u00a02.96 billion-euro share sale in 2013 temporarily eased concern over its finances, the bank raised a further 8.5 billion euros from investors the following year to meet tougher regulatory requirements and fund growth in its\u00a0capital-intensive debt-trading business. Some analysts are unconvinced. A capital increase is still \u201chighly probable\u201d this year even after scrapping dividends, Andrew Coombs, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in a report in November.

Toyota   offering Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto, citing safety and security concerns, while Ford is offering them as apps within its Sync connectivity system this year. \u201cDeveloping a safer and more secure in-car smartphone connectivity service which better matches individual vehicle features is exactly the value and advantage an automaker can offer customers,\u201d Shigeki Terashi, a Toyota executive vice president, said in the statement. Ford said Honda Motor Co., Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.\u2019s Subaru, Mazda Motor Corp. and Peugeot SA also are investigating SmartDeviceLink. The deal shows two of the world\u2019s largest automakers   about giving Apple and Google too much control over displays that IHS Automotive estimates will generate $18.6 billion in sales by 2021. For Toyota, which is involved in another system called   that competes with the two tech giants, the collaboration with Ford suggest the company is spreading its bets on car connectivity options. Consumer awareness of CarPlay and Android Auto \u201creally does fundamentally change what consumers want out of that system in their center stack,\u201d said Jeremy Carlson, an IHS Automotive analyst. Apple and Google will deliver \u201cmost likely the biggest disruption to in-vehicle infotainment systems in the history of automotive.\u201d Ahead of this week\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show, Toyota also said it will equip U.S. vehicles with data communication modules next year that connect cars with cellular networks. The modules will\u00a0enable a system that notifies authorities when air bags deploy due to traffic accidents. Toyota first agreed to collaborate with Ford on car telematics systems in 2011 and   in June last year that it was exploring SmartDeviceLink for its vehicles. MirrorLink, which lets drivers run navigation and entertainment apps on their smartphones using large icons on their dashboard screens, was created by the Car Connectivity Consortium, a group of carmakers and phone manufacturers including Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co., Hyundai Motor Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC Corp. \u201cWe want 25 nav apps, we want 15 music players, we want things that people haven\u2019t even thought of to come to this space,\u201d Alan Ewing, the consortium\u2019s president, said in an interview. For Apple and Google, \u201cthey\u2019re not there to create an environment for app developers to do cool things. They\u2019re there to enable their own businesses.\u201d IHS Automotive has estimated that adoption of MirrorLink will trail behind CarPlay and Android Auto, citing limited consumer familiarity.","timestamp":1451912400.0,"participant_ids":["TM:US","F:US","AAPL:US","GOOGL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-01-04\/toyota-joins-ford-in-resisting-apple-google-car-screen-dominance","subject":"Toyota Snubs Tech Companies With Ford Dashboard Deal"},{"body":"BlackBerry Ltd. jumped the most since January after an industry website   the company\u2019s newest phone is being sold at Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Inc. will scrap the long-planned spinoff of its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., according to a person with knowledge of the matter, under pressure from investors concerned about the tax risks of the deal. The Web portal will instead explore a spinoff of its main Internet businesses, said the person, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn\u2019t yet been made public. The shift came after Yahoo\u2019s   convened last week to consider options for the company\u2019s future, including whether to press ahead with the Alibaba divestiture after questions arose about whether the transaction would be tax-free. The reversal is an admission of defeat for Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer, who was brought aboard in 2012 to revitalize the once-dominant Internet brand yet has struggled to find the right strategy to return the company to growth. With sales hovering around 2006 levels, investors\u2019 patience has begun to wane, and activist shareholder Starboard Value LP last month called for the company to drop the Alibaba spinoff and instead to sell off its Web businesses -- or risk a   fight. Yahoo declined to comment. The stock rose 3 percent to the equivalent of $35.91 at 10:52 a.m. in Frankfurt, having jumped as much as 3.8 percent in extended U.S. trading after CNBC first reported the change in plan. The TV network also said the company is considering options for its stake in Yahoo Japan Corp. The shares have lost 31 percent in New York this year. While Mayer has until now persisted in talking up prospects for the Internet businesses,\u00a0such as search, advertising and media content, investors have been focused on the valuable stake in Alibaba -- and concerns about taxes. That holding, about 15 percent of the Chinese e-commerce company, is worth more than $30 billion. Yahoo\u2019s total market value is about $33 billion. Mayer unveiled the plan to spin off the Alibaba stake in January. In October, she said the stake, which has helped prop up Yahoo\u2019s stock price, was on pace to be divested by next month. Investors who had initially pushed for the spinoff grew concerned about the transaction when Yahoo failed to get prior approval from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on its tax-free status. Going forward with the spinoff plan would carry the risk of getting hit with a tax bill of more than $10 billion, while selling Yahoo\u2019s main business would turn the company into a shell that owns shares in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, without the possible tax burden. Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo -- which paved the way for consumers to access and navigate the Internet in the 1990s -- has lost ground to younger rivals such as Google and Facebook Inc. Yahoo\u2019s share of U.S. digital advertising spending is forecast to fall to 3.5 percent in 2017, from 11.5 percent in 2009, according to EMarketer Inc. The company\u2019s annual sales peaked at $5.4 billion in 2008, and are projected to slip 8 percent this year to $4.04 billion, minus revenue passed on to partner sites. If the company\u2019s board were to seek a sale of the Web business, telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. would explore a possible acquisition, Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said   at a Business Insider conference. His comments echoed remarks by his chief financial officer, Fran Shammo, who said Monday the company would look at a possible deal with Yahoo \u201cif we see there is a strategic fit and it makes sense for our shareholders.\u201d Verizon bought Yahoo rival AOL Inc., another Internet pioneer, earlier this year for about $4 billion. The core Yahoo business could attract a valuation of $3.5 billion or more, depending on the buyer,   to Robert Coolbrith, an analyst at CRT Capital Group. Others have said it could be worth less than $2 billion. Pulling back from the spinoff is a significant change for Yahoo executives who had stood by the deal even as questions were raised about whether it could escape scrutiny from the IRS. At the time of the announcement in January, Mayer said the transaction was the culmination of more than two years of work with advisers to unload the shares in a tax-efficient manner. Mayer said in October that the company would share details in coming months about a strategy for Yahoo\u2019s success after the spinoff. Under her leadership, the company has devoted resources to expanding mobile and other new advertising around video and other formats. Yahoo also signed a new deal with Google that could help boost the search business. Still, Mayer\u2019s efforts have so far failed to show significant progress. She also has lost several executives in recent months, including Jacqueline Reses, Yahoo\u2019s chief development officer, who had shifted her focus this year to the Alibaba share sale. Kathy Savitt, who had been Yahoo\u2019s chief marketing officer, left earlier this year.","timestamp":1449617884.0,"participant_ids":["BABA:US","4689:JP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-09\/yahoo-said-to-scrap-alibaba-spinoff-explore-deal-for-web-units","subject":"Yahoo Said to Scrap Alibaba Spinoff, Explore Web-Unit Deal"},{"body":"Dish Network Corp., taking cues from popular online video services like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., is making over its Sling TV application, greeting users with popular shows rather than channels to appeal to their on-demand viewing preferences.

Asia Cement Corp. has $800 million in financing available to support any Shanshui recapitalization, subject to any proposals to be decided by the liquidators, Clifford Ng, a partner in Hong Kong at Zhong Lun Law Firm which is advising Asia Cement, said in an interview Wednesday. Shanshui\u2019s largest shareholder Tianrui Group Co. said in a Tuesday\u00a0filing it would lend funds if its proposed restructure of Shanshui\u2019s board occurs and triggers early repayment of Shanshui\u2019s $500 million of 2020 bonds. The notes rose 11.9 cents to 81.9 cents as of 5:24 p.m. in Hong Kong. Shanshui became at least the sixth Chinese firm to default in the local bond market this year as a shareholder tussle hurt financing. The firm, which missed payment on a 2 billion yuan ($313 million) note last week, faces a hearing Wednesday on a liquidation application filed in the Cayman Islands, where it is incorporated. Bloomberg reported earlier Wednesday that Asia Cement had agreed in a filing to Cayman courts to make the credit line available to recapitalize Shanshui pending an agreement on its restructuring proposal. The Asia Cement offer \"raises the stakes after Tianrui\u2019s offer last evening to help redeem the 2020 notes,\u201d said\u00a0Charles Macgregor, head of Asian high yield research in Singapore at Lucror Analytics. \u201cThe matter is now firmly in the hands of the court and hopefully they can give some direction this week.\" Shanshui\u2019s CFO Henry Li said when reached by phone that he had heard from his lawyers that ACC has made a filing in the Cayman Islands saying ACC is willing to lend to Shanshui.

Lawfirm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld is representing a group of bondholders in the restructuring, according to a press release on Nov. 11. Shanshui has considered proposals for repaying debt including new share issues, asset restructuring and asset securitization, it said in a Monday filing. It also said that if the Cayman court grants the application and appoints provisional liquidators, they\u2019ll have the right to choose and implement proposals to repay Shanshui\u2019s debts. \u201cOur support for any proposal depends on what the provisional liquidators decide is the best solution for creditors,\u201d\u00a0Ng representing Asia Cement at\u00a0Zhong Lun Law Firm said. \u201cWe want to emphasize that the financial capability we offer will allow China Shanshui Cement to deal with offshore creditors, especially the March 2020 bondholders.\u201d Zhongrong International Trust Co. said Shanshui\u2019s unit repaid 200 million yuan\u00a0on Nov. 13 of loans which were among underlying assets for asset-backed securities issued by\u00a0Bank of Tianjin Co. in July, according to a statement dated Nov. 17 on Chinabond\u2019s website.

China Tianrui Group Cement Co. last month increased its stake in China Shanshui Cement Group Ltd. to 28.16 percent, more than Shanshui founder Zhang Caikui. Fitch Ratings Ltd. deemed the move a change of control. It also downgraded Shanshui to BB- , three levels below investment grade, citing weak cement prices. A change of control also allows some of the company\u2019s dollar bondholders to demand immediate repayment. Cement makers in Asia\u2019s biggest economy are under pressure to clean up their act after Premier Li Keqiang said in March a key priority this year is to enforce new environmental protection laws. Cement makers\u2019 heavy pollution is mainly because of a reliance on coal power. Shanshui Cement, which reported a profit last year about one third of what it achieved in 2013, has embarked on a strategy of selling minority stakes to various companies to raise money in an increasingly competitive environment. \u201cThe Chinese authorities\u2019 approach to the sector is clear -- they want consolidation,\u201d said Kalai Pillay, a senior director at Fitch Ratings in Singapore. In the case of Tianrui\u2019s part acquisition of Shanshui Cement, \u201cwe don\u2019t know the intention of Tianrui and we don\u2019t know how local lenders will react to the change of control.\u201d An investor relations official at Shanshui declined to comment. Tianrui Group spokesman Richard Cai also declined to comment. The ratings company isn\u2019t the only one puzzled by Tianrui\u2019s share buying. Credit analysts and bond investors alike are also in the dark because Tianrui didn\u2019t disclose its intention behind the purchase in the secondary market. Shanshui has also yet to outline any relationship plans with Tianrui. Shanshui\u2019s $500 million of 7.5 percent 2020 bonds sold in March, the most liquid of its notes, fell 2 cents to 98 cents on the dollar in the three business days after its April 16 exchange filing about the stake purchase. They\u2019ve since rebounded to 99.67 cents, still off their pre-Tianrui 101.7 cent-peak. \u201cWhile consolidation is good in the sense that cement players become bigger and it reduces overcapacity, what\u2019s negative for bondholders includes potential changes in management strategy after the Tianrui takeover,\u201d said Raymond Chia, the head of credit research for Asia ex-Japan in Singapore at Schroder Investment Management Ltd. \u201cTianrui has made three to four attempts to tap the offshore bond market but all were pulled, which shows investors\u2019 reception to the company. With this acquisition, concern about Tianrui may spill over to Shanshui.\u201d Schroder managed $474.3 billion as of March 31, including Chinese company debt. Tianrui\u2019s stock acquisition has also sent the free float of Shanshui shares down to just above 9 percent, below the 25 percent minimum the Hong Kong stock exchange requires in order for companies to maintain their  . Shanshui has been suspended at HK$6.29 since April 16 as the board assesses the effect of Tianrui\u2019s increased holding, including its impact on any contractual obligations. Its stock is up 69.1 percent this year. Shanshui\u2019s new controlling shareholder and how Shanshui might react has led analysts to wonder what the deal could mean for bondholders. \u201cWe believe the free float issue and the fight for control may not be resolved any time soon,\u201d Shirley Han, a credit analyst at UBS Group AG in Hong Kong, wrote in an April 17 note. That may weigh on the company\u2019s dollar bonds, she said. Shanshui\u2019s other shareholders include a company associated with founder Zhang -- China Shanshui Investment Company Ltd. -- which holds 25.09 percent, Taiwan\u2019s Asia Cement Corp. with 20.09 percent, and state-owned China National Building Material Co. with 16.67 percent, according to an April 16 Shanshui filing. China National Building Material completed buying its stake in November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and its purchase was mutually agreed upon. Tianrui amassing an interest in Shanshui could trigger a change of control clause on Shanshui\u2019s $400 million of 8.5 percent 2016 notes, according to the securities\u2019 sale document. A change of control is defined as occurring when any person or group\u2019s total voting stock of the company exceeds that held by founder Zhang and his family and affiliates. Should bondholders demand action, Shanshui would have to make an offer to purchase the bonds at 101 cents on the dollar not later than 30 days following the change of control, the prospectus shows. Shanshui had earlier indicated it plans to buy back the bonds on or after their May 25 call date at 102.125 cents on the dollar. Tianrui buying has created some uncertainty as to whether Shanshui will follow through with that plan. The stake acquisition \u201ccould also lead to a delay in calling the 2016s, though we expect holders to be paid later this year in line with company\u2019s earlier intentions,\u201d Deutsche Bank AG analysts Vikash Agarwalla and Harsh Agarwal wrote in an April note. The debentures in question were trading slightly above their put price of 101 cents at 101.65 cents as of 6:07 p.m. in Hong Kong. Based on Shanshui\u2019s cash position of 1.15 billion yuan ($185 million) as at the end of 2014 and proceeds from its 2 billion yuan onshore note issuance last month, the company has sufficient cash to redeem the $400 million bonds. More of a concern is the 2020 notes, money managers say. \u201cThe 2020s, while offering attractive yields, may see some volatility in the short term,\u201d said Raymond Lee, a portfolio manager in Sydney at Kapstream Capital Pty, which manages the equivalent of about $7 billion. \u201cDespite Shanshui\u2019s ability to tap the local market for funding, we expect the company\u2019s financial profile to weaken post the 2017, and potentially 2016, notes buyback.\u201d Shanshui   $400 million of 10.5 percent 2017 notes last month, according to an April 27 exchange announcement. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 105.25 percent of the principal, meaning Shanshui spent $442 million, including accrued and unpaid interest. Compounding the financial pressures on Shanshui from its bonds is China\u2019s cooling property market. New-home prices   in March from a month earlier in 49 of the 70 cities tracked by the government, the National Bureau of Statistics said April 18, while the average price fell for an 11th consecutive month, bringing the decline from a year earlier to 6.1 percent, the steepest on record, according to Bloomberg calculations. The slump in housing demand is hurting cement makers, resulting in several either closing or being sold. Deutsche Bank expects property-related cement demand will contract by 10 percent in China this year. Demand linked to infrastructure projects however may increase by 12 percent, boosted by China\u2019s silk road project. \u201cThere\u2019s a push to phase out low quality cement and older production facilities that aren\u2019t energy efficient,\u201d Fitch\u2019s Pillay said. \u201cThe execution of the strategy to improve efficiency has been a lot more serious in this industry than others.\u201d (An earlier version of this story was corrected to reflect the correct free float percent and an analyst name.)","timestamp":1430780219.0,"participant_ids":["691:HK","CCTZ:TT","1102:TT"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-05\/global-bondholders-caught-in-china-s-cement-consolidation-push","subject":"Global Bondholders Caught in China Cement Consolidation Push"},{"body":"Michael Fassbender wasn\u2019t Hollywood\u2019s first choice to play Steve Jobs in the new movie about his life. Nor the second, for that matter. Sony Corp. would even go on to sell the project to Universal Pictures after Leonardo DiCaprio and Christian Bale passed on the role. So it\u2019s a bit surprising that even before the film opens in some U.S. theaters on Oct. 9, some gambling touts have made Fassbender, 38, the early favorite to win an Oscar for best actor. His portrayal of the Apple Inc. co-founder has garnered plaudits despite some concern from critics and movie fans that the half-German, half-Irish red-head doesn\u2019t look like Jobs, who was of Syrian descent. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin initially backed Tom Cruise as an alternative, partly because he felt Fassbender wasn\u2019t famous enough. \u201cI don\u2019t know who Michael Fassbender is, and the rest of the world isn\u2019t going to care. This is insane,\u201d he wrote to Amy Pascal, then Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman, in a Nov. 3, 2014, e-mail posted on the Internet after a massive hack of Sony\u2019s computers. In a subsequent exchange, Sorkin folded: \u201cF--- it. He\u2019s a great actor whose time has come,\u201d he wrote. Sorkin, who won an Oscar for the screenplay of \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d declined to comment on the content of his messages. But in response to e-mailed questions, he said \u201cthe test was, \u2018Could this actor play the part on stage for two hours?\u2019 There are some things an actor can\u2019t fake, and two of them are brains and charm. Michael has a great deal of both.\u201d \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d which premiered Sept. 5 at the Telluride, Colorado, film festival, focuses on the introduction of three computers: the Macintosh in 1984, NeXT in 1988  As of Oct. 4, Fassbender was first on awards tracker GoldDerby\u2019s best-actor Oscar   with odds of 12-5. DiCaprio was No. 2 at 9-2 for \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d scheduled for release starting Dec. 25. Eddie Redmayne, last year\u2019s winner, was No. 3 at 5-1 for \u201cThe Danish Girl.\u201d Bookmaker   had Fassbender at No. 2, with odds just over 2-1, behind DiCaprio at 13-8. Born in Germany and raised in Ireland, Fassbender played\u00a0Irish Republican Army member Bobby Sands -- his breakout role -- in \u201cHunger,\u201d directed by Steve McQueen in 2008. He earned an Oscar nomination as a cruel cotton farmer in \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and a Golden Globe nomination as a sex-addict in \u201cShame.\u201d He\u2019s Magneto in the \u201cX-Men\u201d movies, an android in \u201cPrometheus\u201d and the cursed king in \u201cMacbeth,\u201d which opens later this year. Despite his range and experience, some of the filmmakers felt hiring him was a risk, based on the leaked e-mails, which describe the twists and turns of the film\u2019s development. DiCaprio was initially in talks for the role. After he dropped out, interest shifted to Bale, who also passed.  \u201cI think Danny needs to rethink how he wants to do the movie,\u201d Pascal wrote in a Nov. 13, 2014, e-mail to producer Scott Rudin. \u201cWe are not gonna get anyone to help us out here at this cost with this cast.\u201d Representatives for Rudin, Pascal and Fassbender declined to comment and didn\u2019t make them available for questions. Sony and Universal also declined to comment. Family members and associates of Jobs opposed the film because they didn\u2019t like how he\u2019s portrayed. His widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, tried to stop the picture from getting made, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 4. Hacked Sony e-mails refer to her opposition and suggest she tried to dissuade actors from taking roles in the movie. Powell Jobs declined to comment, according to a spokesman, as did Sony. Sony finally dropped the project, and Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal unit ultimately took over.   predicts the film will make $92 million in the U.S. and Canada. That would more than cover the production budget, which   estimates at $30 million. Fassbender\u2019s work impressed one viewer with special knowledge of his role: Apple\u2019s other co-founder,\u00a0Steve Wozniak, who consulted with Sorkin before the script was written and met the cast. The actor \u201cdid an incredible job in my mind of creating the \u2018character\u2019 of the movie,\u201d Wozniak said in an e-mailed response to questions.","timestamp":1443978001.0,"participant_ids":["6758:JP","1356954Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-04\/the-steve-jobs-that-sony-didn-t-want-is-now-an-oscar-favorite","subject":"The Steve Jobs That Sony Didn't Want Is Now an Oscar Favorite"},{"body":"Bill Miller turned to an unusual strategy in mounting his comeback as a top stock picker, buying options on hard-hit technology companies to make leveraged bets with a big impact on his returns. The tactic paid off in 2013 and 2014 as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. rebounded and helped lift Miller\u2019s $2.3 billion Legg Mason Opportunity Trust to a top ranking. The veteran manager is having less success so far with a similar wager on Twitter Inc. that he escalated last quarter, when he owned options allowing him to buy $350 million of the stock -- equal to 15 percent of the fund\u2019s assets. The massive wager highlights how some managers are using derivatives to boost profits in mutual funds, tightly regulated investment vehicles that have strict limits on what they can invest in. The technique allows funds to make big wagers with relatively little money up front, though they can lose that money should their bet go wrong. Proponents of the strategy include bond manager Bill Gross, who has said managers need to use leverage to juice up gains in a low-return environment. \u201cYou are going to get a much bigger pop to the upside,\u201d said Abraham Goodfriend, founder of Yedid Capital Management, a Miami Beach, Florida-based firm that employs options. \u201cThe downside is, if you are wrong you are going to lose all your money\u201d paid for the contracts. Miller\u00a0bought options on 9 million shares\u00a0of Twitter in the third quarter, filings show. The drop in value of the options may be one reason the fund lost 4.6 percent over the past month and ranked among the bottom 5 percent of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, though it\u2019s still ahead of 95 percent for 2015. Miller, 65, co-founded Baltimore-based Legg Mason Capital Management and gained fame running its Value Trust, which beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index every year from 1991 through 2005. That mark was tarnished in 2008, when the fund got stuck holding too many bank and mortgage stocks amid the credit crunch and lost 55 percent.\u00a0 He stepped down from Value Trust in April 2012 and now focuses on its smaller counterpart. Opportunity Trust has averaged annual returns exceeding 23 percent since then, and ranks among the top 98 percent of peers over the last three years. In 2013, Opportunity Trust resumed an approach it last used in 2005: buying call options, in which it pays another investor a premium for the right to purchase a fixed number of a company\u2019s shares in the future at a preset price. The contracts generate a profit if the stock exceeds the exercise price during the term, but expire worthless if it fails to reach the target. Buying options frees cash to invest elsewhere and allows a fund to bet on a large number of shares with a small down payment, boosting returns if the underlying stock gains. Miller said in an e-mailed response to questions that options occasionally provide more potential reward for the amount of risk being taken than the underlying stocks. \u201cThis almost always happens after the stock has gone down significantly, which was the case with\u201d Amazon, Apple and Twitter, he wrote. Miller used options amid a bear market for Apple in the first half of 2013, paying a premium of $18.5 million, or $5.29 a share, for the right to buy $250 million of the iPhone maker\u2019s stock. By December 2014, the Apple calls reached $47.60 a share, or nine times what Miller paid. Opportunity Trust gained $71.5 million from options in 2014, accounting for more than a third of its return.\u00a0After investments in airline stocks, Apple calls were the fund\u2019s \u201ctop contributor\u201d for the year, Miller said in the annual report. Miller spent a combined $125 million for new calls on $270 million of Apple and $300 million of Amazon\u00a0shares in 2014\u2019s fourth quarter. \u201cTechnology growth stocks were hit hard in 2014, creating some attractive opportunities,\u201d Miller wrote in the annual report. In the first half of 2015, as Amazon skyrocketed, the fund gained about $108 million from options, or 60 percent of its return. By Sept. 30, the value of its Amazon calls had almost tripled\u00a0from the end of 2014 to $194 million, even after the fund had sold 15 percent of the contracts; by Dec. 30, the market value of its remaining contracts totaled $337.5 million, assuming that Miller hasn\u2019t pared the investment since the end of September. In the first half of 2015, the fund bought 400,000 Twitter shares plus January 2017 calls entitling it to buy 1 million more at $35 each. Opportunity Trust purchased an additional 100,000 shares outright and increased its option exposure to 10 million shares in the third quarter, when warnings of slow user growth by then-interim Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey sent the stock sliding. The fund spent $60 million, or $6.71 a share, on the options acquired in the third quarter. By Sept. 30, the contracts traded at $3.40, and by Dec. 30 they had tumbled to $1.40 as Twitter\u2019s stock closed at $22.23, leaving the calls further out of the money though they have more than a year to recover. Twitter calls were among Opportunity Trust\u2019s \u201ctop detractors\u201d in the third quarter,\u00a0Miller and co-portfolio manager Samantha McLemore wrote in a shareholder report, when the fund\u2019s 10.5 percent drop exceeded the 6.4 percent decline in the benchmark S&P 500. Gross, as the manager of the $1.3 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, has been seeking to boost its income by insuring billions of dollars in corporate and sovereign debt through derivative contracts known as credit default swaps. Earlier this month, the SEC issued a   that would cap the ability of funds to incur leverage through derivatives such as futures and credit default swaps.","timestamp":1451530801.0,"participant_ids":["TWTR:US","AMZN:US","AAPL:US","LMOPX:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-31\/bill-miller-is-misfiring-on-twitter-options-after-boon-on-amazon","subject":"Bill Miller Is Misfiring on Twitter Options After Boon on Amazon"},{"body":"Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma, China\u2019s second-richest person, made headlines last year when he visited Hollywood looking for deals. He met with studio executives such as Sony Pictures\u2019 Michael Lynton and sat courtside at a Los Angeles Lakers game with superagent Ari Emanuel and actor Jet Li. One memento of the trip surfaced this summer in the form of the Paramount Pictures hit  . Alibaba Pictures Group invested in the feature, which generated $479 million in global box office through Aug. 30, and got the rights to sell merchandise and tickets to its 367 million customers in China when the film opens there on Sept. 8. The deal with Viacom\u2019s Paramount is one of more than a half-dozen in the past year between U.S. studios and Chinese companies that are quickly putting down roots in Hollywood. Alibaba, Dalian Wanda Group, Huayi Brothers Media, and others want to funnel films through their media outlets at home, as well as deepen their understanding of the lucrative business. \u201cChina is trying to learn why Hollywood is so successful,\u201d says Stanley Rosen, a University of Southern California political science professor who studies the relationship between the mainland and the U.S. film industry. China, he says, wants to master the business \u201cfrom the bottom up.\u201d Hollywood is happy to help. It needs the cash plus access to theaters in China, where the government limits the number of imported movies and controls how they are released. Such connections are crucial since China, projected to overtake the U.S. in box-office receipts by 2020, accounted for most of the growth in global movie ticket sales last year. China\u2019s would-be moguls hope to use stronger Hollywood ties as a way to make even more money off entertainment. When   opens there, Alibaba will sell tickets online through its Taobao Movie unit, one of the country\u2019s major ticketing platforms, which offers advance seat selection. People can pay using Alipay, Alibaba\u2019s version of PayPal. The company also is planning to build China\u2019s answer to Netflix and HBO, via a new service called Tmall Box Office. Alibaba acquired a company called ChinaVision Media Group in 2014 to help it enter the business and renamed it Alibaba Pictures. The company sold HK$12.2\u00a0billion ($1.6 billion) in stock in June. Alibaba Pictures shouldered an undisclosed portion of the $150 million cost of making   and said it\u2019s looking for more ways to invest in Hollywood. (Paramount, which declined to comment for this story, said in June it hoped the deal was \u201cthe first of many collaborations\u201d with Alibaba.) State-backed China Movie Channel also invested in the spy flick, saying it would promote the film and sell tickets online. In a first for U.S. audiences, the names of both Chinese companies were displayed in the opening credits of the movie, following the century-old practice of studios like Paramount. Last year, China\u2019s theaters brought in People close to Alibaba say Ma\u2019s strategy is to invest in specific films, rather than in studios. But real estate mogul Wang Jianlin, China\u2019s richest man, is making bigger bets on infrastructure. Wang\u2019s Dalian Wanda Group operates the world\u2019s largest chain of movie theaters and is building the planet\u2019s biggest studio theme park, Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis, on the coast of Shandong province. Wanda controls the No.\u20092 U.S. theater chain, AMC Entertainment Holdings, and last year bought land in Beverly Hills, where it plans to erect a $1.2 billion complex it calls its \u201cfirst important step into Hollywood.\u201d Wanda, which footed the entire production cost of  , the summer release from Weinstein Co., also donated $20\u00a0million to a museum being built in Los Angeles by the motion picture academy that awards the Oscars; its film history gallery will be named after Wanda. Wang, who\u2019s talked of buying stakes in studios Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, wants to control 20 percent of the global film market by 2020. Over the past year, U.S. studios \u201care going to these big companies with single pictures and saying, \u2018Would you like to invest?\u2019\u2009\u201d says Robert Cain, a partner at Pacific Bridge Pictures, a film producer and consultant. \u201cThey\u2019re investing because the opportunity is now being presented, and that\u2019s only a recent phenomenon.\u201d Huayi Brothers Media, a Beijing-based moviemaker and distributor, raised about $560\u00a0million in August from investors including Ma\u2019s venture capital outfit and Tencent Holdings, as well as Shanghai-based Fosun International, which has put $200 million into the Studio 8 production company on Sony\u2019s Hollywood lot. Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital is among the backers of STX Entertainment, run by Robert Simonds, producer of films such as   and  . \u201cChina is trying to learn why Hollywood is so successful\u201d Even the Chinese government is getting in on the action. Besides  , state-run China Movie Channel, the country\u2019s No.\u20093 TV network, invested in Paramount\u2019s Terminator: Genisys. China Film Group, the government-run distributor of all foreign movies, took about a 10 percent stake in Universal Pictures\u2019 car-heist thriller  , which cost $190 million to make and grossed $1.5 billion globally\u2014a quarter of that within China. There are risks, of course. China Film also invested in Sony\u2019s Adam Sandler box office disappointment  . Cain says China\u2019s government is able to use its control over its lucrative home market to influence U.S. studios and exert soft power\u2014the kind of cultural influence that\u2019s made Hollywood a global ambassador for America. China Film invested in  , a thriller starring Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe about an elite force making a last stand for humanity on China\u2019s snaking barrier. It\u2019s targeted for a November 2016 release by Universal.

Two new films opened in wide release. Redford\u2019s big-screen return in \u201cA Walk in the Woods\u201d landed in third place over the long Friday-to-Monday weekend and \u201cThe Transporter Refueled\u201d opened in fifth. Labor Day closes out the important summer season, which typically produces about 40 percent of annual box-office sales. Heading into the weekend, summer revenue in the U.S., while shy of the 2013 record, was up almost 7 percent from a year earlier, according to BoxOffice.com. \u201c\u2018War Room\u2019 continues to benefit from filling a void in the marketplace for the largely underserved faith-based audience,\u201d Paul Dergarabedian, Rentrak\u2019s senior media analyst, said in the statement. The film, showing in 391 locations more than its first weekend, brought its total sales in North America to $27.9 million after just 11 days of release, Rentrak said. \u201cWar Room\u201d follows a seemingly perfect couple, Tony and Elizabeth Jordan, with great jobs and a beautiful daughter.

After leading for three consecutive weeks, \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d about the pioneering rap group N.W.A, took in $11.1 million for Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal Pictures, falling to second place. \u201cA Walk in the Woods\u201d produced $10.5 million. In the film, Redford plays renowned travel writer Bill Bryson as he treks the Appalachian Trail. His peace is broken by companion Stephen Katz, played by Nick Nolte. The comedy has the two clashing over their definitions of adventure. Emma Thompson also appears. The movie secured about 47 percent positive reviews, according to aggregator Rottentomatoes.com. In fifth place,\u201cThe Transporter Refueled,\u201d from EuropaCorp, Ed Skrein plays Frank Martin, a retired mercenary who has become a transporter for hire. A father-son bonding weekend in the south of France takes a turn for the worse when a group of feisty females involve him in a bank heist. The movie generated sales of $9 million. Just 17 percent of reviews were favorable, according to Rottentomatoes. The film is a reboot of the Luc Besson film and TV series.

Carrefour agreed to pay 36.4 million euros, followed by Colruyt\u2019s 31.6 million euros fine, according to details of a settlement with the Belgian agency made public on Monday. The coordinated price increases concerned a large number of branded products between from 2002 to 2007, the Belgian watchdog said. Colgate-Palmolive Co. blew the whistle on the infringement and escaped a penalty. Procter & Gamble Co., Delhaize Group SA and L\u2019Oreal SA agreed to pay 29.1 million euros, 24.9 million euros and 8 million euros, respectively. Additional companies were fined. The fines follow a combined penalty of more than $1 billion in a similar case in France. L\u2019Oreal was among a group of companies sanctioned in December over allegations of a conspiracy to rig the prices of consumer products. The Belgian settlement decision can\u2019t be appealed. \u201cWe must admit that over 10 years ago our internal control processes were not as optimized as they are today,\u201d Frans Colruyt, the company\u2019s chief operations officer for retail, said in a statement.

Bankers Face 10-Year Bonus Clawback in BOE Misconduct Rule Senior bankers found guilty of misconduct by regulators may be forced to pay back bonuses as long as 10 years after they were awarded under new Bank of England rules. The BOE said that it would also seek public input on curbing so-called buyout arrangements whereby a new employer compensates bankers for bonuses they were in line to receive had they stayed in their old jobs. The BOE said the measures would promote better conduct in financial institutions. Andrew Bailey, chief executive officer of the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, said in an e-mailed statement that the intention of the agency\u2019s regulations is to foster a culture of effective risk management. The plans are part of a wave of banker-pay curbs from the BOE, which last year announced a rule that senior managers at banks could have bonuses clawed back as long as seven years after they\u2019re awarded. That measure took effect at the start of 2015. The extended clawback period announced on Tuesday would apply when bonuses are awarded at a bank that has been notified by its regulator that it\u2019s under investigation for \u201cpotential material failures,\u201d according to the BOE. The measures were announced in tandem with the Financial Conduct Authority, which is responsible for supervising markets and consumer protection. For more,  . Uber\u2019s Customer Tracking Draws FTC Complaint From Privacy Group Uber Technologies Inc. shouldn\u2019t track customers when they aren\u2019t using the ride-sharing application, according to a complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday by a digital-privacy group. Under Uber\u2019s new privacy policy, which is scheduled to go into effect July 15, the ride-sharing service plans to seek customers\u2019 permission to collect location and address book information when the app is running in the background, according to the complaint from the   in Washington.

Uber said it has revised its privacy policies to be more transparent and doesn\u2019t collect background location data and has no plans to start doing so July 15.

Federal Raisin-Reserve Program Undercut by U.S. High Court The federal government must compensate raisin growers who are required to set aside part of their crop during high-production years, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, gutting a decades-old program designed to stabilize prices. The high court ruled that the raisin-reserve requirement was a governmental \u201ctaking\u201d of private property, something the Constitution outlaws unless officials provide \u201cjust compensation.\u201d The court overturned more than $600,000 in penalties assessed against a couple who refused to comply with the reserve rule. The raisin-reserve requirement is an unusual one, and the justices said during arguments in April that the case won\u2019t affect most other Agriculture Department programs. Major crops such as corn and soybeans aren\u2019t covered by marketing orders like the one issued in 1949 to govern the raisin business. Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts said the government could accomplish the same goal by limiting production, rather than taking possession of extra raisins. \u201cA physical taking of raisins and a regulatory limit on production may have the same economic impact,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cThe Constitution, however, is concerned with means as well as ends.\u201d Seven of the other eight justices agreed with Roberts that the program was a taking. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented. Under the program, authorized by a 1937 statute, each year a committee decides based on market conditions whether to impose a reserve requirement. The program applies to California raisins, nearly the entire U.S. raisin market. The case is Horne v. Department of Agriculture, 14-275.

The debtor-in-possession loan would be junior to the company\u2019s $400 million first-lien credit line from Oaktree Capital Group LLC, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. More than two-thirds of holders of the miner\u2019s $650 million of 10 percent, first-lien bonds maturing in June 2020 have consented to the plan, two of the people said. Molycorp shares fell 14 percent to 60 cents. The stock traded as high as $79.16 in 2011. Jim Sims, a spokesman at the Greenwood Village, Colorado-based Molycorp, and Carissa Felger, a spokeswoman for Oaktree Capital at Sard Verbinnen & Co., declined to comment. Molycorp, which had $1.73 billion of long-term debt on March 31, said that month that it may not be able to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d if it can\u2019t restructure its obligations, and it hired Miller Buckfire & Co. and Jones Day to evaluate its capital structure. The group of first-lien bondholders, advised by Houlihan Lokey and Kramer Levin, submitted the plan late April including swapping a portion or all of the notes into equity, the people   Bloomberg then. Molycorp has been focusing on extending the maturity of its $206.5 million of 3.25 percent convertible notes that mature in June 2016. Failure to retire majority of the notes on time would trigger early repayment of the Oaktree borrowings. The convertibles last traded at a record low 4.75 cents on the dollar May 6, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The first-lien notes ended the following day at 50 cents to yield 29.7 percent. Molycorp, which has been suffering from depressed rare-earths prices and a slower-than-expected ramp-up in production at its Mountain Pass facility in California, on May 7 reported an 8 percent decrease in revenue to $106 million in the first quarter. The commodities prices dropped 16 percent in the period, averaging $30.97 per kilogram from $36.91 in the fourth quarter. Molycorp reported $134 million in cash at the end of the period.

The U.S. Treasury Department   in September to make it harder for American companies to pursue overseas mergers that move their legal addresses abroad and produce tax benefits. The new rules put a damper on the practice and led drugmaker AbbVie Inc. to scrap its more than $50 billion   for Shire Plc. Even so, the door isn\u2019t shut entirely. Just this week, in a deal that was largely upstaged by bigger M&A news in the cable and drug industries, U.S. telecommunications equipment maker Arris Group Inc. agreed to buy British set-top box maker Pace Plc for about $2.1 billion and become a U.K. company. While the transaction will be affected by the Treasury\u2019s rules, it will be highly accretive and reduce Arris\u2019 tax rate. Shares of Arris surged 22 percent. The deal \u201cwill signal to people that, \u2018Hey, the Treasury notice didn\u2019t really end the game here and it\u2019s still a worthwhile thing to do,\u2019\u201d Robert Willens, a New York-based independent consultant on corporate taxes, said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be an isolated event.\u201d Most of the inversions going forward will probably continue to be similar to the Arris-Pace merger: relatively small and involving two companies that aren\u2019t major household names. Deals like that have a better shot at getting done without triggering the same political alarm that surrounded bigger transactions such as Pfizer Inc.\u2019s failed attempt last year to buy AstraZeneca Plc for more than $100 billion. The inversions announced since AbbVie and Shire\u2019s merger went bust have been valued at less than $2 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. These have included Steris Corp.\u2019s merger with Synergy Health Plc and Wright Medical Group Inc.\u2019s combination with Tornier NV, both of which are still pending. One of the biggest consequences of the Treasury\u2019s crackdown is a restriction on hopscotch loans, which allow companies to access foreign cash without paying U.S. taxes. That was one of the main advantages that AbbVie was counting on for its purchase of Shire. What the agency  , however, is a practice known as earnings stripping. It\u2019s a maneuver that inverted companies use to effectively shift earnings to lower-tax countries and reduce the amount of income taxed at the U.S. rate of 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world. Earnings stripping is a more important benefit of inversions for some companies than access to foreign cash, Willens said. The Treasury has said the agency may address the practice in a second round of guidance, yet no restrictions have been announced. It\u2019s going to be difficult for the Treasury to do much without action by Congress because the technique is hardwired into the tax code, said William Dantzler, a tax partner at White & Case LLP. It\u2019s also used by overseas firms with big U.S. operations, he said. \u201cInversions made sense last year for multiple reasons and the Treasury only killed one of those reasons, which was accessing trapped cash,\u201d Dantzler, said in a phone interview. \u201cAll the other reasons still exist.\u201d Mega-sized inversions are still legally doable, according to Willens. Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said in October after the new Treasury rules were announced that he saw \u201cno reason why we wouldn\u2019t be able to do an inversion\u201d if it finds an attractive deal. The $217 billion drug giant agreed in February to   Hospira Inc. for $17 billion, which analysts said left the   for bigger deals including a combination with Dublin-based Actavis Plc. Even so, inversions may be less financially appealing for companies such as Pfizer now without the ability to move foreign subsidiaries out from under the U.S. parent and access overseas cash tax-free, according to  , an accounting professor at Michigan State University. But \u201cinversions will still be in play under the right circumstances,\u201d Outslay wrote in an e-mail.","timestamp":1429895580.0,"participant_ids":["ABBV:US","SHP:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-24\/inversion-deals-aren-t-dead-they-re-just-more-low-key-real-m-a","subject":"Inversion Deals Aren\u2019t Dead, They\u2019re Just More Low-Key: Real M&A"},{"body":" Uber Technologies Inc. shouldn\u2019t track customers when they aren\u2019t using the ride-sharing application, according to a complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday by a digital-privacy group.

The group is asking the FTC to investigate and force Uber to end practices that EPIC says aren\u2019t necessary for the company to carry out its ride-sharing service. \u201cWhat the company calls a privacy announcement actually serves a different purpose,\u201d said Julia Horwitz, a coordinator at EPIC. \u201cIt actually gives the company many more permissions.\u201d While Uber states that location services may be disabled to prevent the app from gathering location data, the complaint says that \u201cUber can still collect location information through the phones\u2019 IP addresses.\u201d Uber says it will allow users to opt out of these features. However, while users with iOS phones can disable the contact syncing option by changing the contacts setting on their phones, the Android mobile platform doesn\u2019t offer any such setting, according to the FTC filing. \u201cThere is no basis for this complaint,\u201d Uber said in an e-mailed statement. Uber said it has revised its privacy policies to be more transparent and doesn\u2019t collect background location data and has no plans to start doing so July 15. The company said it receives Internet-protocol addresses as part of the traffic data that all apps receive and that users can choose to turn off location data on their devices and input their locations manually. Justin Cole, a spokesman for the FTC, said the agency carefully reviews complaints from consumers. He declined to comment on whether the agency is investigating Uber\u2019s practices. The complaint is the latest hurdle facing Uber, which has come under pressure for its criticisms of journalists and its privacy practices. Online publication BuzzFeed said in November that one of its reporters was tracked by an Uber executive without her permission. Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, has called for Uber to answer questions about its privacy policies. The company recently hired a law firm to conduct an internal review. Uber has also   about tracking so-called \u201crides of glory,\u201d or customers who use the service between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. on a Friday or Saturday night and then order a ride home 4-6 hours later, according to a post on the company\u2019s website.

Bonds Benchmark 10-year   yields fell three basis points to 2.05 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yield reached 2.10 percent on Oct. 23, a two-week high. German 10-year yields dropped two basis points to 0.50 percent. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a global economy with a slower growth profile, we\u2019re seeing concerns about earnings, all of which suggests that the Fed will continue delaying the liftoff,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, a government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. \u201cThat\u2019s generally considered supportive for the Treasury market.\u201d Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback against 10 major peers, slipped. The measure rose for a seventh day Friday to the highest level this month. The dollar is benefiting from policy divergence as central banks outside the U.S. struggle to bolster growth. \u201cFear of the Fed will take some of the shine off the dollar this week,\u201d said\u00a0Neil Jones, the London-based head of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. \u201cThe focus will shift away from ECB and the PBOC to the Fed this week.\u201d U.S. data \u201cmay disappoint to the downside,\u201d which would further act as a drag on the currency, he said. The yen added 0.4 percent to 120.992 on Monday. Japan\u2019s currency fell 0.6 percent, the most since Sept. 2, on Friday to cap its biggest weekly drop since May 29.  Commodities Oil traded near the lowest closing price in almost four weeks, with West Texas Intermediate dropping 1.5 percent to $43.92 a barrel. Oil is failing to sustain a rally earlier this month above $50 a barrel as surging U.S. inventories bolstered speculation that a global glut will be prolonged.  futures fell to the lowest since April 2012 as traders reacted to near-record inventories and mild weather that\u2019s pushing back the start of winter demand for the heating fuel. The commodity for November delivery fell 9.8 percent to settle at $2.062 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Gold halted a three-day drop. Investors are tracking the Fed to see when borrowing costs will start to rise for the first time since 2006, with policy makers beginning a two-day meeting in Washington on Tuesday. Futures rose 0.3 percent to settle at $1,166.20 an ounce in New York. Emerging Markets The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slipped 0.1 percent for a fourth loss in five days. The\u00a0index has still advanced 9.6 percent in October, on track for the biggest monthly gain since January 2012, as investors speculated the Fed will postpone an interest-rate increase until March.  assets rallied after Mauricio Macri\u2019s surprisingly strong showing in the first round of the presidential election fueled optimism the next government will unwind interventionist policies and bring the country back to international bond markets. Brazil\u2019s real declined as concern that the nation\u2019s fiscal picture is worsening outweighed investors\u2019 optimism over emerging markets.

At least eight of 12 equity strategists tracked by Bloomberg have lowered their estimates for where the Stoxx Europe 600 Index will end the year in the last three months, with the average prediction falling to 395. Back in July, they were forecasting the gauge would exceed April\u2019s record to finish at 422. Even in September, four weeks after China devalued the yuan, they were still holding on to bets that strong earnings would fuel the biggest\u00a0  since 2009. The Stoxx 600 rose to 360.99 on Thursday. \u201cIf we get more disastrous data from China, analysts may need to cut targets again,\u201d said Markus Wallner, an equity strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, who projects the Stoxx 600 will cap the year at 380. \u201cChina is like a black box with no one knowing what could really happen. Another problem, particularly for the DAX Index, was Volkswagen.\u00a0They have to make provisions and earnings will fall. It is still influencing the DAX and its sector.\u201d While economic data in the region are still beating forecasts and the   said it\u2019s ready to increase stimulus, that\u2019s little comfort to investors. The Stoxx 600 has lost 14 percent since April and came within 2 percentage points of a bear market in September. Equities in Germany, China\u2019s biggest European trade partner, tumbled as much as 24 percent as VW sank to a four-year low. Strategists now estimate the DAX will finish 2015 at 10,708, according to the average of 12 projections. That\u2019d be 13 percent below its record, also reached in April. The gauge fell to\u00a09,915.85 yesterday. Bankhaus Lampe\u2019s Ralf Zimmermann, who cut his rating for euro-area stocks by 9.3 percent since last month, says investors will soon start piling into the cheaper equities. The Stoxx 600 trades at 15.6 times estimated profits, down from 17.4 in April. \u201cEarnings won\u2019t fall off the cliff, but even stagnating earnings would be a relief as investors already fear a decline,\u201d Zimmermann said in an interview from\u00a0Dusseldorf. \u201cThe rebound in stocks isn\u2019t driven by a strong and accelerating economy, but by a relief that a global recession will be prevented. There is a decent chance that we see some relief in markets.\u201d Analysts have cut projections for 2015 earnings growth at Stoxx 600 companies to 3.9 percent, from 6.5 percent in August, before the China-induced selloff. This makes some traders, such Alex Neil from EFG Bank in Geneva, more cautious on equities, even after a six-day rally that took the benchmark index to a one-month high following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to delay an interest-rate increase. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some of the biggest cuts to consensus estimates across the board that I can remember,\u201d said Neil, head of equity and derivatives trading at EFG Bank. \u201cI worry that in the absence of any genuine top-line growth delivery from companies, investors\u2019 cheering of prolonged Fed inaction will turn into tedium.

The new law allows workers who drive for\u00a0ride-hailing services, such as those from Uber and Lyft Inc., to form unions and negotiate wages with the companies. While Seattle Mayor Ed Murray expressed concerns, council members supported the bill. \u201cIt was a huge victory for drivers who took a lot of risks; many have been deactivated, lost their jobs,\u201d said Dawn Gearhart, a representative of Seattle Teamsters Local 117, which is working to organize drivers as part of the App-Based Drivers Association. \u201cDrivers have really worked hard to get to this point.\u201d While Seattle\u2019s collective-bargaining law is the first of its kind, Uber and Lyft face lawsuits and regulatory battles in cities around the U.S. that threaten to change how it classifies and compensates drivers. The companies oppose claims that drivers are employees, rather than independent contractors who aren\u2019t entitled to Social Security benefits, mileage reimbursements and other benefits. Uber, which has been valued by investors at $62.5 billion, has raised more than $10 billion to spread its ride-hailing business globally.\u00a0A spokeswoman declined to comment on Monday\u2019s vote in Seattle. Uber and Lyft have said drivers appreciate the flexibility to set their own hours and other perks that are unique to on-demand work. \u201cLyft drivers are entirely in control of where or when they work, and this flexibility is exactly why the service is so popular with people looking to make extra income,\u201d Sheila Bryson, a spokeswoman for Lyft, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cUnfortunately, the ordinance passed today threatens the privacy of drivers, imposes substantial costs on passengers and the city, and conflicts with longstanding federal law.\u201d Uber\u2019s employment practices have come under scrutiny recently, with drivers in California suing the company to be treated as employees rather than contractors. Last week,   that restricts their right to sue. Uber and Lyft make it easy to summon a car with the click of a button, but drivers can be booted permanently from the system almost as easily. \u201cThis bill was only introduced out of necessity after witnessing how little power drivers themselves had in working for a living wage,\u201d Mike O\u2019Brien, the Seattle councilman who proposed the collective-bargaining bill, said in a statement. Under the new law, taxicab and for-hire car companies must bargain with a \u201cdriver representative\u201d over the terms and conditions of work, if a sufficient number of drivers choose to be represented. In a letter to the council, Mayor Murray said putting the law into effect and defending it in court would be costly. \u201cI have been clear that I support the right of workers to organize to create a fair and just workplace,\u201d Murray wrote. \u201cBut I remain concerned that this ordinance, to which amendments continue to appear today, includes several flaws.\u201d There is still a long road ahead in Seattle. More than half of active Uber or Lyft drivers in the city will need to vote to elect a representative. That process may not be resolved until at least the end of 2016, said Gearhart, the labor representative.","timestamp":1450131029.0,"participant_ids":["0084207D:US","0812823D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-15\/uber-drivers-win-seattle-vote-on-collective-bargaining-rights","subject":"Seattle Votes to Allow Uber Drivers to Form Unions"},{"body":"Amlin Plc\u2019s $5.3 billion takeover by a Japanese competitor has put the remaining four publicly traded Lloyd\u2019s of London insurers in the spotlight for a possible takeover. Beazley Plc, Hiscox Ltd., Lancashire Holdings Ltd. and Novae Group Plc all rallied in London trading on Tuesday after MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc. agreed to pay 670 pence a share for Amlin -- a 36 percent premium to Monday\u2019s closing price. The deal,\u00a0which represents 2.4 times net tangible book value, is the highest multiple paid for a Lloyd\u2019s insurer. \u201cWith only a limited number of quoted Lloyd\u2019s insurers left, we believe that all listed companies are likely takeover targets,\u201d said Paris Hadjiantonis, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in a note to clients on Tuesday. The recent wave of insurance mergers will \u201clead to further consolidation within Lloyd\u2019s.\u201d Amlin adds to a string of deals in the Lloyd\u2019s and Bermuda insurance markets as an influx of reinsurance capital weakens prices and investment income dwindles from record low interest rates. The U.K.\u2019s Catlin Group Ltd. and Brit Plc earlier this year both sought safety in combining with an overseas competitor. The bid comes as reinsurers worldwide fly to   this weekend to begin talks on pricing for 2016. Standard & Poor\u2019s said Tuesday that many firms in the industry will struggle to maintain strong profitability in the next two years, paving the way for further consolidation. Excluding Amlin, there have been about $81 billion of insurance acquisitions worldwide in 2015, more than double the amount of the year-earlier period. The U.S. and Bermuda have so far accounted for the lion\u2019s share, led by Ace Ltd.\u2019s $28 billion deal to buy Chubb Corp. Beazley, Hiscox and Lancashire have all previously reiterated their plan to remain independent, while Amlin\u2019s Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Charles Philipps said just two weeks ago that the firm was not for sale, saying rumors in the insurance market \u201cseemed to be rife.\u201d Lancashire and Novae are the\u00a0most plausible takeover candidates because of their smaller market value and exposure to reinsurance, KBW\u2019s\u00a0Hadjiantonis and Westhouse Securities Ltd.\u2019s Joanna Parsons wrote in notes to investors. Shore Capital\u2019s Eamonn Flanagan also named Lancashire as the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d to a takeover, adding that an acquisition of either Beazley or Hiscox would not be cheap. Novae shares were little changed at 8:45 a.m. after rising 5.4 percent to its highest since 2001 on Tuesday. Lancashire and Beazley were up 1 percent, while Hiscox rose 1.9 percent. A spokeswoman for Beazley declined to comment, while officials for Novae, Hiscox and Lancashire weren\u2019t immediately available to comment. Outside of Lloyd\u2019s, bidders for Amlin\u2019s peers have been mainly Bermudian firms looking to diversify away from catastrophe reinsurance or insurers in Japan and China seeking wider access to international markets. Buying a Lloyd\u2019s insurer provides a network of insurance licenses globally and \u201cimmense\u201d intellectual capital, Flanagan said. \u201cThe quoted Lloyd\u2019s insurance sector is shrinking fast, and question will be who is next?\u201d said Parsons, head of research and insurance at Westhouse in London. \u201cAll the companies will start to attract a scarcity valuation as few Lloyd\u2019s insurers are now independently owned.

Schiller became a key architect of the drug company\u2019s breathtaking rise and, it turns out, of its sudden decline. As Valeant\u2019s chief financial officer, he helped build a deal machine that rewrote the rules of the pharmaceuticals industry. Along the way, he kept Wall Street close. The story of Valeant and its lucrative ties to the financial industry is a familiar tale of mutual advantage and propitious timing. Jeff Ubben, of the hedge fund ValueAct Capital, helped bring in J. Michael Pearson from McKinsey & Co. to run Valeant. Pearson then helped lure Schiller from Goldman Sachs. And Goldman Sachs and other banks brought in investors, making many millions in fees in the process. Today, as the drug company confronts questions about its accounting and business model, Schiller, 53, is no longer playing his old role. He announced in April that he would step down as CFO, at the time when Valeant was flying high. Goldman Sachs, a long-time adviser, lender and underwriter for Valeant, has handled neither debt nor equity financing since 2013, when it acted as sole underwriter of a $2 billion equity offering. Like many firms, Goldman Sachs has long maintained a \"buy\" rating on Valeant stock. After batting away questions about his company\u2019s relationship with the specialty pharmacy Philidor RX Services LLC and, on a special conference call on Oct. 26, reiterating that Valeant had done nothing wrong, Pearson on Friday cut ties with Philidor. The move came a day after Bloomberg News   that Philidor altered doctors\u2019 prescriptions to wring more reimbursements out of U.S. health insurers. Through it all, Valeant\u2019s shares have continued to twitch -- up about 7 percent on Wednesday, down almost 5 percent on Thursday, to $111.50. That\u2019s down from $147 before a short-seller questioned Valeant\u2019s practices last week. However the Valeant story plays out, some analysts and investors are now wondering about the model Pearson and Schiller developed with Wall Street\u2019s help. Neither Valeant executives nor any of the banks that have worked with the company have been accused of wrongdoing. Schiller, approached Monday night at his home in suburban New Jersey, declined to comment, as did Meghan Gavigan of Sard Verbinnen & Co., which is handling public relations for Valeant. Schiller ran Goldman Sachs\u2019 health-care practice until 2009, when he became the chief operating officer of Goldman\u2019s investment bank. The next year, the bank advised Valeant on its breakout purchase of Biovail Corp. After Schiller arrived at Valeant, in late 2011, the drug company orchestrated some of its most controversial deals. In the process, Valeant enriched its shareholders. Its market value soared from $14 billion to $70 billion during Schiller\u2019s tenure as CFO, as one Wall Street analyst after another placed \u201cbuy\u201d on its stock. Schiller, who remains a director and a consultant after stepping down from his finance post, has continued to take a lead in explaining Valeant\u2019s inner workings. In July, he testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Investigations about Valeant\u2019s tax policy. He was out front again during Monday\u2019s conference call: Valeant turned to him, rather than to a company officer, to walk investors through a big part of Valeant\u2019s presentation about its ties to Philidor. Schiller told listeners that Valeant had launched a pilot prescription-fulfillment program through Philidor, and based on its success decided to strengthen its relationship with the specialty pharmacy. Then, last December, Valeant \"acquired the option to acquire Philidor,\" he said. That view changed today. \u201cWe have lost confidence in Philidor\u2019s ability to continue to operate in a manner that is acceptable to Valeant and the patients and doctors we serve,\u201d Pearson said in a statement. Under Pearson and Schiller, Valeant became a lucrative client for Wall Street. Goldman Sachs, for instance, was entitled to more than $15 million in fees for the Biovail deal. The firm also earned about $55 million for helping the drug maker raise $9.3 billion in debt and equity financing for the 2013 acquisition of Bausch & Lomb Inc., including its role as sole underwriter of a $2 billion stock sale, regulatory filings show. Goldman Sachs Lending Partners served as the lead lender among a group of banks that provided a credit line and term loans to Valeant. Later, the same banking group agreed to raise as much as $8 billion in financing for Valeant\u2019s proposed acquisition of Allergan Inc. Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t participate in that group offering financing and stepped down as the banking group\u2019s administrative agent because it was involved in defending Allergan against the deal. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Michael DuVally, confirmed the details surrounding the Allergan proposal and that the bank is a lender to Valeant, declining to comment further. Valeant\u2019s deal -- championed by William Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager -- fell apart after it was outbid by Actavis Plc. Schiller announced his resignation the following month. It was an opportune exit. Under the terms of his departure, he stands to continue vesting in a stock and options package that made up the bulk of his $46 million in pay through 2014, according to company filings. Before stepping down, he sold $24 million of Valeant stock to pay taxes, including a portion when the shares were trading above $200, company filings show. During the Monday call, Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, raised a question on many people\u2019s minds: Why did Schiller leave when he did? \u201cI feel like no one\u2019s satisfied, and I keep getting that question from many investors in many meetings. So, would appreciate all your input there,\u201d Raffat said. Schiller reiterated that after two careers over 30 years, he wanted to \"do some things on my own.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe timing was right. And again, just to be absolutely crystal clear, if I had \u2013- and which I\u2019m guessing, it could be an undertone of the question, if I had any concerns whatsoever about Valeant or Mike I would not have stayed on the board. It\u2019s as simple as that.\" Pearson quickly followed up. He said Schiller had called him shortly after the stock-commentary site Citron Research, run by short-seller Andrew Left, sent Valeant\u2019s stock into a tailspin with a report   the company\u2019s accounting and its relationship with Philidor, the pharmacy. Pearson has since called for authorities to investigate Citron. \u201cWhen the Citron report hit and all hell broke loose, the first call I received was from Howard,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cI think he was here an hour later, and I\u2019m not sure he left the building since. So, Howard is the lowest paid board member per hour.\"","timestamp":1446188400.0,"participant_ids":["GS:US","PSON:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-30\/valeant-s-goldman-connection-a-cfo-schooled-on-wall-street","subject":"Valeant's Goldman Connection: A CFO Schooled on Wall Street"},{"body":"Broken Hill spawned the world\u2019s largest mining company and generated more than $75 billion in wealth. Now as its minerals ebb, Australia\u2019s longest-lived mining city is looking to tap a more abundant resource. On the sun-baked edge of the Outback city, 700 miles west of Sydney,\u00a0a solar farm the size of London\u2019s Hyde Park shimmers like an oasis \u2014\u00a0its panels sending enough electricity to the national grid to power 17,000 homes a year.\u00a0Combined with a sister plant, the\u00a0AGL Energy Ltd.\u00a0and\u00a0First Solar Inc.project is the largest of its type in the southern hemisphere. Clean energy advocates are counting on the 140-hectare (346-acre) development to make Broken Hill, which at one time boasted the world\u2019s\u00a0most successful\u00a0silver mine, a trailblazer once again. The\u00a0birthplace\u00a0of Broken Hill Proprietary Co., whose 2001 merger with Billiton Plc formed the mining giant BHP Billiton Ltd., will help pave the way for more projects that profit from the sun\u2019s power. \u201cIt\u2019s giving birth to the large-scale solar industry in Australia,\u201d said Adam Mackett, AGL\u2019s project manager, as he strolled among the 678,000 solar panels\u00a0under a cloudless blue sky. \u201cHopefully, from Broken Hill\u2019s point of view, they\u2019ll see this as the start of something bigger.\u201d Australia gets more solar radiation per square meter than any other continent. Yet while the nation leads the world in installing rooftop solar panels, it trails 19 countries from Bulgaria to Ukraine in producing the power at solar farms.\u00a0 Solar accounted for about 2 percent of Australia\u2019s electricity generation last year, according to the Clean Energy Council, an industry group in Melbourne. Fossil fuels, by contrast, made up almost 87 percent of the mix, reflecting the nation\u2019s reliance on mining. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so rich underground, we shouldn\u2019t ignore what we have above ground,\u2019\u2019 said Esther La Rovere, a Broken Hill native and co-owner of the Palace Hotel, a 48-room inn featured in the 1994 movie \u201cThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\u201d \u201cBroken Hill does need to reinvent itself and be part of new technologies and ways of doing things \u2014\u00a0and we\u2019ve got plenty of sunshine.\u201d Mining is so inextricably linked to\u00a0Broken Hill that even the 126-year-old hotel was once connected to a nearby mine by an underground tunnel. An enormous pile of discarded rocky earth looms over the city, whose street names are inspired by the minerals and compounds that have helped sustain it, like Argent, Cobalt, Bromide, Sulphide and Oxide. Broken Hill is home to the world\u2019s largest known lead-zinc-silver deposit. Its 8-kilometer (5-mile) ore body has been mined continuously since the 1880s and is now petering. Just two mining companies remain \u2014\u00a0Japan\u2019s\u00a0Toho Zinc Co.\u00a0and China\u2019s\u00a0Shenzhen Zhongjin Lingnan Nonfemet Co. \u2014\u00a0and the city\u2019s population has almost halved from about 35,000 in 1915. While the\u00a0Silver City has drawn tourists for decades, other new enterprises are needed to spur the local economy,\u00a0and the potential for another solar project is being explored, said Mayor Wincen Cuy. \u201cTwo things we have plenty of are sunlight and wide-open spaces,\u201d Cuy said in his office, a few kilometers from the AGL-First Solar development. \u201cIf we can become the capital in Australia for solar, that would be pretty impressive.\u201d The\u00a0A$440 million ($314 million) solar farms in Broken Hill and Nyngan, about 590 kilometers east, received A$232 million in grants from the New South Wales state and federal governments, and new ventures are likely to need their support. The Australian government has committed A$350 million more for\u00a0utility-scale solar projects and is reviewing applications for funding. Companies such as First Solar, the largest U.S. solar manufacturer, are keen to develop more plants in Australia, said Jack Curtis, its Asia-Pacific manager. The industry is looking for assurance that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is more climate-friendly than his predecessor, Tony Abbott, who said coal was \u201cgood for humanity.\u201d Australia\u2019s climate policies have been criticized for not going far enough. The government\u2019s commitment to cut carbon emissions by 2030 is projected to leave the country as the highest per-capita polluter among Group of 20 nations after Saudi Arabia, according to the Climate Institute, a Sydney-based non-profit organization. Solar is among the sources that could help. \u201cIt\u2019s another opportunity which doesn\u2019t rely on digging stuff out of the ground,\u201d said AGL\u2019s Mackett. Shares in the Sydney-based utility have climbed 29\u00a0percent to A$17.20\u00a0so far in 2015, compared with a 5.6\u00a0percent slide in the benchmark\u00a0S&P\/ASX 200 index, as the company under new Chief Executive Officer Andy Vesey expands in green energy.\u00a0 The sprawling solar farm \u2014\u00a0near the hills where Mel Gibson tore up post-apocalyptic highways as the Road Warrior in the 1981 movie \u201cMad Max 2\u201d \u2014\u00a0reached full production in October. During construction, about 150 people were employed there, resulting in a A$15 million boost to the local economy, AGL estimates. Now, kangaroos occasionally outnumber the two or three people needed to run the plant. Geoff Luke, a zinc miner\u2019s son who sold part of his property to AGL in 2012, sees other benefits for the city. \u201cBroken Hill needed something different,\u2019\u2019 said Luke, 64, who owns the Black Lion Inn and sometimes fields questions from tourists about the solar plant. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for the image of the town.\u201d The successful completion of the Broken Hill and Nyngan farms will give banks and contractors more confidence in working with major solar developments in the future, AGL\u2019s Mackett said. The Australian government aims to get almost a quarter of the nation\u2019s power from clean energy sources by 2020. That will drive a 15-fold increase in large-scale solar capacity by 2021, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. For now though, solar power in Australia is more expensive than wind, and AGL says an over-supply of aging coal-fired power stations needs to be rationalized to encourage investment in clean-energy sources. A decline in development costs for solar farms should close the gap with wind and stimulate more investment, said Ludovic Theau, executive director at the government\u2019s Clean Energy Finance Corp. \u201cWe do see a substantial step-up in activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next five years for us are absolutely critical.\u201d","timestamp":1450642675.0,"participant_ids":["FSLR:US","AGK:AU"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-20\/how-an-australian-mining-town-became-a-solar-power-trailblazer","subject":"How an Australian Mining Town Became a Solar Power Trailblazer"},{"body":" A project in the Australian Outback that will more than double the country\u2019s large-scale solar output should begin generating its initial power as early as this week, according to First Solar Inc. The A$290 million ($220 million) Nyngan solar plant in New South Wales state will start at 25 megawatts before increasing to full capacity of 102 megawatts, said Jack Curtis, Asia-Pacific manager at First Solar, a partner in the project led by AGL Energy Ltd. The plant will be fully operational by July, Sydney-based AGL said last week. The solar project is expected to be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere until a 141-megawatt First Solar   begins in late 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AGL and First Solar, the U.S. panel manufacturer, are also building a 53-megawatt solar plant in Broken Hill, west of Nyngan in New South Wales. \u201cWhat was really constraining the large-scale solar market was the fact that it just hadn\u2019t been done before, so there was a lot of misconception around the execution and cost challenges,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cIt can only get more efficient.\u201d While the government says Australia has the highest average solar radiation per square meter of any continent, solar accounted for less than 2 percent of its electricity generation in 2013, the Clean Energy Council estimated. As much as 4.1 gigawatts of large-scale solar photovoltaic capacity is forecast to start in Australia through 2021, about 85 times current output, according to a January report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Combined, the Nyngan and Broken Hill projects are estimated to cost about A$440 million, with the Australian and state governments providing A$232 million in funding. They will produce enough energy to supply more than 50,000 homes in New South Wales, according to AGL\u2019s website. A compromise between the government and the opposition Labor party on where to set the 2020 renewable energy target would revive investment in the industry.

Dow is in late-stage talks to merge with DuPont in what could be the largest deal in the chemicals industry, people with knowledge of the matter said Tuesday. The company would then break into two or three businesses for antitrust reasons, the people said. The focus in Europe on Wednesday quickly turned to Switzerland\u2019s Syngenta AG, which almost four months ago fended off a $46 billion bid from Monsanto Co. Last month, people with knowledge of the matter said China National Chemical Corp. was initially rebuffed in an approach to buy the world\u2019s biggest producer of pesticides in what would be the largest acquisition ever by a Chinese company. A Dow and DuPont merger \u201cmakes it more likely that Monsanto re-approaches Syngenta,\u201d Bernstein analysts including Jonas Oxgaard wrote in a note Wednesday. The bid could be at 485 Swiss francs, more than the 470 cash-and-stock offer withdrawn in August. DuPont and Dow, which have market capitalizations of about $58.4 billion and $59 billion respectively, have in recent months confirmed they were weighing options for their agricultural-chemicals businesses, both of which supply genetically modified seeds. There\u2019s been widespread speculation about potential deals in that industry as lower crop prices curb farmer spending. Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant said last month that \u201ceverybody has been talking to everybody\u201d in the industry while Chief Operating Officer Brett Begemann said the company is considering whether to begin another attempt to buy Syngenta. \u201cMonsanto could launch a takeover offer at any point\u201d for the Swiss company, Martin Schreiber, analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank, said by e-mail. \u201cA merger between Dow and DuPont could put Syngenta in a bind.\u201d Syngenta shares rose as much as 3.1 percent and were trading 2.3 percent higher to 368.20 Swiss francs as of 2:42 p.m. in Zurich. Shares in BASF SE were down 0.7 percent to 70.48 euros in Frankfurt while Clariant AG fell 0.3 percent to 18.20 Swiss francs. Any Dow-DuPont deal resulting in both the world\u2019s largest seed and pesticide company and the second-biggest chemical company after Germany\u2019s BASF AG could transform the competitive landscape of the industry as well as offer up assets to European players. The pressure on Monsanto to defend its position as the biggest seeds player is probably \u201chuge\u201d\u00a0as chemical companies will want to defend, or even strengthen, their market positions, said Oliver Schwarz, an analyst at MM Warburg. The merger would create a strong competitor for European companies in the North and South American agrochemicals and seed markets, according to analysts at Baader Helvea.\u00a0They estimate the combined U.S. companies would sell about 16 percent of the world\u2019s pesticides and would be the third-largest supplier of crop chemicals. The regulatory hurdles to the transaction mean the combined company would have to sell off some businesses, presenting European peers with a window to make deals of their own, analysts said. \u201cThere would certainly be assets for sale and those would probably be interesting to contenders such as BASF,\u201d said MM Warburg\u2019s Schwarz.\u00a0\u201cAll the big companies that are swimming in this pond would probably be interested in taking over assets that Dow or DuPont would sell.\u201d For its part, Swiss specialty chemical maker Clariant could make a strategic asset swap with its plastics and coatings business, according to Schreiber. Clariant is separating out this pigments and plastic resins business starting in January. \u201cIt\u2019s not about getting bigger, it\u2019s about becoming more focused. That is a trend that we have been seeing for a long time,\u201d Bayer AG Chief Executive Officer Marijn Dekkers said at a press conference Wednesday. \u201cCompanies are saying that it\u2019s difficult to be positioned so broadly.\u201d","timestamp":1449660811.0,"participant_ids":["SYNN:VX","MON:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-09\/dow-dupont-merger-would-spark-european-agrochemicals-scramble","subject":"Dow, DuPont Merger Would Spark European Chemicals Scramble"},{"body":" First Solar Inc., the largest U.S. solar manufacturer, recovered from its first loss in three years after a newly formed joint venture helped boost revenue 65 percent. Sales in the second quarter increased to $896 million from $544.4 million, Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar said in a statement Tuesday. That exceeded the $788 million average of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer James Hughes is shifting the company\u2019s business model, from selling solar farms to utilities to placing them in a holding company, 8point3 Energy Partners LP., which it formed this year with rival SunPower Corp. This model, often called a yieldco, is increasingly popular in the renewable energy industry because it gives developers a ready customer for their power plants. \u201cThe creation of this yield company vehicle benefits us in several ways,\u201d Hughes said on a conference call Tuesday. \u201cIt provides us a competitive buyer for our completed projects.\u201d First Solar said the boost in sales was due in part to selling its majority stakes in two California solar farms to 8point3, the 32-megawatt Lost Hills project and the 60-megawatt North Star power plant. First Solar announced in February plans to form 8point3 Energy with SunPower, and the new company sold shares in an   in June. Shifting to the yieldco model contributed to first-quarter losses for both First Solar and SunPower as they delayed sales of completed power plants. SunPower also   in the second quarter, reporting an 18-cent-per-share profit July 28 that slightly exceeded the 16-cent average of nine analysts\u2019 expectations. First Solar did even better. Net income was $94.5 million, or 93 cents per share in the second quarter, up from $4.5 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. That was almost double the 50-cent average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg. First Solar lost $62.3 million in the first quarter, its first   since 2012. The company expects to ship as many as 2.9 gigawatts of panels this year, up from an April forecast of 2.6 gigawatts to 2.8 gigawatts this year. That will lead to full-year revenue of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion and earnings of $3.30 to $3.60 a share.

The San Jose, California-based company plans to have 1 gigawatt of Chilean solar farms in five years, increasing its presence in the country, Chief Executive Officer Tom Werner said. \u201cChile is a strategic market for the company,\u201d Werner said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cTo build such a big solar capacity, we will participate in the energy auctions processes. Chile has phenomenal sunshine, and the economic environment is favorable.\u201d With a target of 20 percent of energy generation coming from renewables by 2025, President Michelle Bachelet\u2019s government has stepped up to play a stronger role in the sector. Last year Chile introduced a system in which intermittent suppliers like wind and solar could sell power in  , increasing their ability to compete with traditional power plants. Chile will install a record amount of renewable capacity this year, with 1.1 gigawatt of clean energy going online, including 680 megawatts from photovoltaic plants, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cNow growth will come from auctions. Chile alone will be responsible for half of new solar installations in Latin America this year,\u201d said Adam James, solar analyst for Latin America at GTM Research. Solar energy generation in Chile has soared in the past two years. In 2013, the country had almost no capacity. Now it has 546 megawatts installed and another 1.7 gigawatts under construction, according  SunPower built the 70-megawatt Salvador solar farm in Chile\u2019s Atacama region. It will begin construction on a 100-megawatt project in the central region of the country by the end of the year to serve large power consumers, such as Chile\u2019s mining companies. The company is in talks with development and private banks to get financing. Solar panels for the new facilities will come from SunPower\u2019s manufacturing plant in Mexico. For the new installations, SunPower will focus on long-term power purchase agreements with distributors, according to Nam Nguyen, SunPower\u2019s vice president of global power plants. Contracting directly with mining companies will also drive growth, while Chile\u2019s spot market will have less activity in the next few years, she said.

It\u2019s a chance for Under Armour Inc. and star Stephen Curry to challenge Nike Inc.\u2019s decades of basketball dominance. Under Armour is about a 10th the size of Nike in sales, and it\u2019s up against a company that sponsored Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James -- players with a combined total of 13 titles. But Under Armour took a chance on Curry, signing him away from Nike before last season. And when the guard brought the Warriors to their first finals in four decades, that bet paid off. \u201cThis is a huge opportunity for us,\u201d said Adam Peake, Under Armour\u2019s executive vice president of global marketing. To capitalize on the moment, the company may air television commercials during the games, he said. It also plans to release Curry-themed videos and other content through social media. If there ever was a match-up that embodied the David-versus-Goliath state of the basketball-shoe market, this is it. Curry faced long odds to reach this stage. He played at Davidson College, a fringe program, and was often deemed too small to excel in the National Basketball Association. But Curry has made up for his skinny frame with record-breaking shooting, earning him a most valuable player award this season. He\u2019ll be taking on the Cavaliers\u2019 James, a Nike-sponsored athlete who was   \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d on the cover of Sports Illustrated in high school. Unlike many players, James lived up to early hype. He\u2019s won two titles and four MVP awards. With his fifth straight trip to the NBA Finals, which start on Thursday, he\u2019s earned the nickname \u201cKing James.\u201d Like  , Under Armour is an underdog in its battle with Nike -- the world\u2019s largest sports brand, with about $30 billion in sales. In basketball, the odds are especially stacked in Nike\u2019s favor. It controls about 95 percent of the basketball-shoe market in the U.S., according to research firm SportsOneSource. Under Armour registers in the low-single digits, putting it in third place behind Adidas AG. Nike dominates globally too. The Jordan brand rules the fashion side of the industry, more than a decade after Michael Jordan\u2019s retirement, and Nike\u2019s other footwear leads in the performance category. Under Armour, based in Baltimore, only started making basketball shoes in 2010. \u201cNike can\u2019t even see them in the rear-view mirror at the moment, but they are there, just far back,\u201d said Neil Schwartz, vice president of market insights at SportsOneSource. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to slay the dragon with one basketball shoe.\u201d The Curry One, Under Armour\u2019s first shoe named after a basketball player, was released in February. The product has helped the company\u2019s basketball-shoe sales triple this year in the U.S., according to SportsOneSource. Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, said it\u2019s confident in its market position, given its partnerships with James, Bryant and Kevin Durant -- last season\u2019s MVP -- and ability to make innovative products. The Curry shoe sold out, thanks in part to limited supply, Schwartz said. Under Armour kept inventories low, a strategy Nike has used for decades to drive demand, he said. \u201cSteph Curry epitomizes Under Armour\u2019s attitude and where it\u2019s come from,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cThey\u2019ve come in and done an amazing job of going from nothing to something quickly.\u201d But even when a shoe company is blessed with a red-hot athlete, it can be hard to capitalize on it. Just ask Reebok. The company had Allen Iverson -- another sensational shooting guard -- when he was arguably the most popular player in the league. He did little to chip away at Nike\u2019s empire. Even several versions of Nike\u2019s signature shoe for James didn\u2019t sell well, said Matt Powell, an analyst at research firm NPD Group Inc. \u201cThey have to be very careful,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe immediate reaction will be to make a gajillion pairs of shoes and squeeze everything out of this. That\u2019s not the way to grow a shoe business. You want them to sell out and for people to be hungry for the next one.\u201d With his arrival in the finals, Curry\u2019s exposure and popularity will probably surge. Games are shown on cable TV in the U.S. during the semifinals, and then the Finals shift to prime time on broadcast network ABC, helping them reach a bigger audience. With the games reaching more than 200 countries, the number of international viewers also grows. Curry\u2019s diminutive stature -- at 6-foot-3, 190 pounds -- only adds to his appeal, according Shawn Bryant, a former NBA executive who specialized in player marketing. James, in contrast, is a sculpted 6-foot-8 and 250 pounds. \u201cWhen you see him on the court he looks like he\u2019s a little guy,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cKids can relate. That\u2019s really important.\u201d Curry\u2019s 2-year-old daughter, Riley, also has broadened his appeal. She\u2019s become a star in her own right during the playoffs after appearing on her dad\u2019s lap during post-game press conferences. Under Armour has been proving skeptics wrong since Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank founded it as a workout-shirt maker almost 20 years ago. Now it makes all manner of sporting goods, and sales have doubled in the past three years to more than $3 billion. Through Wednesday\u2019s close, the stock rose 53 percent over the past year. Plank\u2019s ultimate goal for Under Armour is to supplant Nike as the biggest sports brand in the world, and he knows the path there is through basketball. While soccer has more fans, it doesn\u2019t generate as much apparel and footwear sales as hoops. That\u2019s mainly because it hasn\u2019t crossed over into casual wear as much, and pro soccer remains a niche sport in the U.S. The NBA has been adding to its huge U.S. fan base by marketing overseas for years and turned players like Jordan, Iverson, Kobe Bryant and James into global stars. In basketball, big names are what drives sales, more so than in other sports. And Under Armour needs an international star, given that about 90 percent of its revenue comes from North America. Basketball also has much-coveted cachet with teens and 20-somethings because of its ties to urban culture, style and music. These are inroads that Under Armour, which historically has a stronger connection with suburbanites, wants to make. \u201cThe culture of basketball -- being part of that conversation as a brand -- is something we\u2019re really excited about,\u201d said Under Armour\u2019s Peake.","timestamp":1433334445.0,"participant_ids":["UA:US","NKE:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-03\/under-armour-gets-shot-at-hoop-dreams-with-curry-in-nba-finals","subject":"Under Armour Suits Up Stephen Curry to Challenge Nike in NBA Finals"},{"body":"SunEdison Inc., the worst-performing solar company this year, canceled its $250 million deal to buy a 16 percent stake in the Brazilian renewable energy company Renova Energia SA, the second time in as many months it\u2019s backed away from the South America market.

After propping up financial markets with zero interest rates and debt purchases for seven years,\u00a0top monetary-policy makers are becoming a less calming presence as the new year approaches. The U.S. Federal Reserve has started raising its benchmark rate, and the Bank of England may be next. That not only reduces liquidity, it also threatens to fray the nerves of investors fearing a policy mistake. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have delivered less stimulus than markets had hoped for and may again disappoint. The first international divergence in monetary policies since the early 1990s is adding to the uncertainty, and doubts are mounting over just how powerful unconventional measures such as bond-buying really are anyway. \u201cGravity could start to act on asset prices as the policy distortions fade or are curtailed,\u201d said Stephen Jen, founder of London-based hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners LLP. For an early taste of next year, look back to Dec. 3. The ECB\u2019s ramp-up of quantitative easing fell short of the expectations of investors who\u2019d been listening to dovish statements from President Mario Draghi. The euro climbed the most since 2009 against the dollar and the German 10-year bund yield rose the most in four years. Or look at last week, when BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda confused markets by announcing a new stock-buying plan without warning. Equities surged -- then slumped again when it became clear the program would only offset sales of separate BOJ holdings. The worry is that Draghi and Kuroda are less able or willing to provide as much easy money as previously anticipated. They may also have lost some of the communication skills which have served to soothe investors. It doesn\u2019t have to be so, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen showed last week. While her policy makers raised rates for the first time in nine years, the shift was well telegraphed and she promised future action would be \u201cgradual.\u201d Markets absorbed the tightening without hiccup, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index barely changed on the week. Investors may nevertheless find it harder to digest future rate hikes. Bond traders, for example, are now pricing in around two Fed increases next year, while the so-called dot plot of projections from officials points to four. \u201cIn 2015, the Fed\u2019s dots moved to the market\u2019s expectation,\u201d said Jen, a former International Monetary Fund official. \u201cFor 2016, the order may switch around.\u201d Another risk is that the Fed goes too far and is then forced to shift into reverse -- just as the ECB and every other major central bank which raised rates since 2008 ultimately had to. Even if the Fed successfully avoids a policy error, its tightening has brought to an end almost a decade of uniform strategy by the world\u2019s major central bankers. That too will be tricky for investors to accept, according to Alberto Gallo, head of global macro credit research at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. \u201cWhen central banks are hiking and policy is diverging, volatility and risks both rise,\u201d he said. At the same time, Gallo sees skepticism about whether quantitative easing even serves to boost inflation and economic growth\u00a0in debt-laden nations by enough to justify side-effects such as asset bubbles and wealth inequality. \u201cInvestors are growing increasingly wary of central bankers\u2019 credibility and worried about the effectiveness of further stimulus,\u201d said Gallo, who expects central banks will struggle to tighten. Amid questions about the effectiveness of their current tools, Erik Nielsen of UniCredit Group AG said many policy makers may roil markets next year by trying to weaken their exchange rates as a route to stronger expansions. \u201cI see a very large number of central banks actively and aggressively fighting FX appreciation, and a few quite explicitly wanting a weaker currency,\u201d said Nielsen. \u201cCentral banks have become a key source of volatility.\u201d Policy makers aren\u2019t completely out of  . JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates the average interest rate for developed economies will remain below 1 percent a year from now, while those who need it could push rates deeper below zero. Bank of America Corp. calculates the combined assets of the four top central banks will reach $13.5 trillion by the end of 2017, up from $11 trillion today, as the BOJ and ECB buy more. \u201cIn a world that has been awash with central-bank liquidity for most of the past decade, the central question for the year ahead is how the global economy and financial markets will react as the tap on that liquidity begins to tighten,\u201d said David Folkerts-Landau, chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG. \u201cWhile the pivot away from this great monetary experiment is unprecedented and will not be without risks, we expect the world economy and financial markets to weather this turn in policy reasonably well.\u201d","timestamp":1450821661.0,"participant_ids":["0504528D:US","2539Z:GR","8301:JP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-23\/gravity-is-back-for-2016-markets-as-central-bank-support-ebbs","subject":"Gravity Is Back for 2016 Markets as Central Bank Support Ebbs"},{"body":"If this 83-year-old billionaire is right, one of the most important lessons of business school is pretty much wrong. All that stuff about focusing on shareholders? Forget it, says Kazuo Inamori, entrepreneur, management guru and Buddhist priest. Spend your time making staff happy instead. He\u2019s used this philosophy to establish electronics giant Kyocera Corp. more than five decades ago, create the $64 billion phone carrier now known as KDDI Corp., and rescue Japan Airlines Co. from its 2010 bankruptcy. From Kyocera\u2019s headquarters overlooking the hills and temples of the ancient capital of Kyoto, Inamori expresses doubts about western capitalist ways. His views are a reminder that many bastions of Japanese business don\u2019t buy into Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s plans to make companies more devoted to shareholders. \u201cIf you want eggs, take care of the hen,\u201d Inamori said in an interview on Oct. 23. \u201cIf you bully or kill the hen, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d It\u2019s a view that carries weight because of Inamori\u2019s success. KDDI and Kyocera have a combined market value of about $82 billion. When Inamori was named chief executive of Japan Airlines in 2010, he was 77 and had no experience in the industry. The next year, he returned the carrier to profit and led it out of bankruptcy. In 2012 he   it on the Tokyo stock exchange. The secret, as Inamori tells it, was to change employees\u2019 mentality. After taking the CEO role without pay, he printed a small book for each staff member on his philosophies, which declared that the company was devoted to their growth. He also explained the social significance of their work and outlined Buddhist-inspired principles for how employees should live, such as being humble and doing the right thing. This made them proud of the airline and ready to work harder for its success, Inamori has said. The doctrine gained traction, in part because the line between one\u2019s work and personal life is more blurred in Japan than the U.S. Not all of Inamori\u2019s tactics are so spiritual. His \u201camoeba management\u201d system split staff into often tiny units that make their own plans and track   using an original accounting system. His turnaround also cut roughly a third of the airline\u2019s workforce, about 16,000 people. \u201cCompany leaders should seek to make all their employees happy, both materially and intellectually,\u201d Inamori said. \u201cThat\u2019s their purpose. It shouldn\u2019t be to work for shareholders.\u201d While that might not impress some investors, the man himself sees no conflict. If staff are happy, they\u2019ll work better and earnings will improve, he said. Companies shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to make profits if they\u2019re pursued in a way that benefits society, Inamori has said. He\u2019s the second son in a family of seven children and grew up in Kagoshima, the birthplace of Japan\u2019s last samurai rebellion. If Inamori\u2019s teachings don\u2019t always follow the typical management grad-school script, there\u2019s no shortage of people wanting to learn them. More than 4,500 business owners attended the annual convention of his   school in Yokohama last quarter. Inamori said he volunteers his time to speak to attendees, as part of philanthropic activities that also include funding the Kyoto Prize, a Japanese version of the Nobel awards. Beside the Kyocera headquarters in Kyoto stands a five-floor museum dedicated to Inamori\u2019s life and philosophies. The companies Inamori has led are connected by more than their management approach. Kyocera was the largest shareholder in KDDI as of Sept. 30 with 13.7 percent of voting rights, according to the phone company\u2019s website. The stake is worth $8.2 billion, almost half of Kyocera\u2019s market value. Kyocera owns 2.1 percent of Japan Airlines, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Inamori and his family have a net worth of $1.1 billion, putting them 32nd in a list of Japan\u2019s 50 richest people this year, according to Forbes. Hong Kong-based Oasis Management is   on the electronic equipment-maker to return cash to investors by selling its stake in the airline and \u201cgreatly\u201d reducing holdings of KDDI. Through Wednesday, Kyocera\u2019s shares had risen 48 percent since Abe\u2019s government took power in 2012, compared with an 84 percent gain for the benchmark Topix index. Kyocera added 1.4 percent in Tokyo today, against a 1 percent gain for the Topix. Return on equity, a measure of the profit companies make from shareholders\u2019 capital, stood at 5.8 percent at the end of September, against an average of 8.6 percent for the Topix. Investors \u201cwant to get the highest returns possible. I understand that,\u201d said Inamori, talking about shareholders in general. He says the KDDI holding pays good dividends and serves as a buffer against hard times. \u201cAt times company management has to say no to shareholders\u2019 selfish requests.\u201d Seth Fischer, chief investment officer at Oasis, says this is an outmoded way of thinking and ignores the risk that KDDI\u2019s business may founder. His fund is part of an influx of activists encouraged by Japan\u2019s efforts under Abe to make firms more accountable to stockholders. \u201cWe are shareholders, not \u2018selfish\u2019 shareholders,\u201d Fischer said by e-mail. \u201cThe view that management has a duty to protect the business from shareholders is exactly the behavior that Abenomics is designed to change.\u201d When Inamori talks about making employees happy, he doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be putting their feet up. His brand of happiness comes from working harder than anyone else. It\u2019s infused with the Buddhist idea of \u201cshojin,\u201d elevating the soul through devotion to a task. In a 2004   on his philosophy, he questioned Japanese people\u2019s increasing tendency to value leisure time. Inamori\u2019s less-extreme capitalism is a product of Japanese society, which he says is less willing to accept gaps between haves and have-nots than western economies. Executives have to take that into account, he said. \u201cCompanies do belong to shareholders, but hundreds or thousands of employees are also involved,\u201d Inamori said. \u201cThe hen has to be healthy.\u201d","timestamp":1446667200.0,"participant_ids":["6971:JP","9433:JP","9201:JP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-04\/the-no-1-business-rule-of-this-billionaire-and-buddhist-priest","subject":"The Buddhist Priest Who Became a Billionaire Snubbing Investors"},{"body":" The rout in crude oil is turning out to be more than just a blip, and producers that are feeling the pinch may have to start selling. Energy company bonds tracked in a Bloomberg high-yield index -- representing a combined face amount of about $180 billion -- trade on average at levels that would be considered distressed. The gauge includes explorers such as Halcon Resources Corp., Energy XXI Ltd. and Goodrich Petroleum Corp., all of which could turn to asset sales to shore up their finances. Others may follow the lead of   and decide a takeover premium to today\u2019s depressed prices is a better solution. Lightstream Resources Ltd. put its oil-rich Bakken shale assets on the block  , though its plunge to an all-time low could draw bids for the whole company, said Kyle Preston of National Bank Financial. The selling pressure will give buyers with cash to spend and a willingness to ride out market volatility plenty to choose from. \u201cIn December, there was still a lot of thought that we were going to have this rebound,\u201d Neal Dingmann of SunTrust Banks Inc. said in a phone interview from Houston. \u201cAs those attitudes change, you\u2019re going to have these deals start to happen sooner rather than later. You can only sort of kick the can down the road so long.\u201d West Texas Intermediate crude has plunged more than 50 percent from its peak last year and last week fell to as low as $44.20 a barrel. The Russell 1000 Energy Index has lost more than $500 billion in market value over the same time period. Tanking oil prices will mean less cash flow to repay the debt that producers took on amid record-low interest rates. CreditSights Inc.  the default rate for energy junk bonds will double this year. Since producers\u2019 borrowing capacity is tied to the value of their reserves, companies may also find it harder to refinance or get new loans, especially if they have low credit ratings. Spending cuts may only go so far, leaving asset sales as the next best option to raise cash. \u201cA lot of these companies are having some heart-to-heart discussions with their lending groups right now,\u201d Chad Mabry, a Houston-based analyst at MLV & Co., said by phone. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to see some tough love doled out. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to be really the catalyst for M&A activity.\u201d Some producers have already taken steps to cut costs and shed assets. Others are likely to follow. Goodrich Petroleum is exploring options for all or part of its Eagle Ford shale assets after losing about 90 percent of its market value in the oil rout. The company had about $610 million in debt at the end of September, or more than four times its market value as of last week. Halcon Resources has the most debt relative to its market value among similar-sized North American peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company this month said it would focus its reduced drilling budget on just three rigs, two in the Fort Berthold area of the Williston Basin and one in its El Halcon property in East Texas. It had planned to have as many as 11 rigs in 2015. The cutback opens up the possibility that Halcon could try to sell some of the acreage where it\u2019s not currently drilling, said Dingmann of SunTrust. The company, valued at $507 million as of last week, also   in the Tuscaloosa Marine and Utica shale formations, according to its website. With sustained low oil prices, \u201ccompanies will start to sell off the family silver,\u201d David Meats, a Chicago-based analyst at Morningstar Inc., said by phone. Halcon and Goodrich are among those that \u201cneed to keep an eye on their liquidity the most. They are the most likely candidates\u201d to sell assets. Others to watch include Clayton Williams Energy Inc. and Denbury Resources Inc., according to Dingmann. Clayton Williams can withstand the downturn, chief operating officer Mel Riggs said in a phone interview. The company\u2019s main positions in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin aren\u2019t for sale, though it would consider selling non-core assets if approached, he said. On the Canadian side, heavily indebted companies such Penn West Petroleum Ltd. and Bonavista Energy Corp. will also need to do something to raise cash, Preston said. For some producers, a plan for asset sales could turn into a full-blown change of control. Lightstream was already feeling the pressure of its debt load last month when oil was about $56 a barrel and the Calgary-based operator announced plans to sell all or part of its Bakken assets over the next two years. With crude now even lower and its stock cheaper, buyers may just bid for the whole company instead, said Preston of National Bank Financial. Preston values the Bakken assets at about C$1 billion, compared with Lightstream\u2019s market capitalization of just C$204 million on Monday. Crescent Point Energy Corp., a possible suitor for the assets or company, \u201cis in the driver seat and Lightstream is backed into a corner,\u201d Preston said. While Lightstream Monday announced the suspension of dividend payments and a small asset sale, the company\u2019s debt is poised to amount to almost 10 times its cash flow this year, which violates debt covenants, Preston said in a note, recommending shareholders sell the stock. Most takeover interest will focus on producers with stronger balance sheets that have become more affordable with oil\u2019s plunge, said Mabry of MLV. Major oil companies certainly have money to spend. Private-equity funds have also been stalking the oil patch for deals. KKR & Co. is   as much as $3 billion to provide financing for troubled companies, including those hurt by plunging oil prices, after deploying a previous pool more quickly than it expected, according to two people familiar with the matter. \u201cOnce the better-capitalized companies, the larger cap companies see a bottoming here, they\u2019re going to snatch up what they see as attractive deals for quality assets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all about quality.\u201d Mabry puts Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. and PDC Energy Inc. in that category. Dingmann of SunTrust pointed to Continental Resources Inc. and Whiting Petroleum Corp., two of the largest operators in the Bakken shale formation. Other buyers are looking beyond North America. Schlumberger Ltd., the world\u2019s largest oilfield-services provider, today   it will pay $1.7 billion for a stake in Eurasia Drilling Co., which operates in Russia. Elsewhere, Tullow Oil Plc\u2019s management   the British company could be vulnerable to an approach after plunging oil prices eroded its market value, people familiar with the matter said last month. Santos Ltd., an Australian oil explorer that\u2019s building an $18.5 billion gas export project, could also tempt suitors. The company said in December that it  . Representatives for Denbury; Carrizo; PDC Energy; Goodrich; Halcon; Bonavista; Lightstream, and Continental Resources didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Penn West, Tullow, Whiting Petroleum and Santos declined to comment. Buyers may hold off until oil prices stabilize, said Chris Feltin of Macquarie Group Ltd. Right now, sellers are likely holding onto dreams of their pre-collapse valuations and not interested in striking deals at such depressed prices, he said. Those that do agree to transactions will probably push for all-stock deals so that their investors can take advantage of an eventual recovery in oil prices, said Michael Dillard, managing partner for the Houston office of Latham & Watkins LLP. Even so, Repsol SA\u2019s $8.3 billion deal for Talisman in December shows that there are willing buyers and sellers. Repsol offered $8 a share for the Canadian explorer, a 60 percent premium that was enough to clinch the deal even though Talisman had traded above that level as recently as October. \u201cThey just said, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s get a nice juicy premium over the current trading price and call a spade a spade -- it\u2019s a very challenging environment and this is an easy exit,\u2019\u201d Meats of Morningstar said. \u201cYou could apply the same logic to other companies.\u201d","timestamp":1421722801.0,"participant_ids":["HK:US","LTS:CN","GDP:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-20\/oil-rout-ratchets-up-pressure-on-producers-to-sell-real-m-a","subject":"Oil Rout Ratchets Up Pressure on Producers: Real M&A"},{"body":" U.S. oil producers are issuing new shares of stock at the fastest pace in more than a decade, looking to investors for a cash lifeline to pay down debt and keep drilling as crude prices continue to sink. Tapping equity markets has become the best option for companies such as Dallas-based RSP Permian Inc., which announced March 17 it\u2019s seeking to raise as much as $232 million by selling additional shares. Calgary-based Encana Corp. and Noble Energy Inc. of Houston also have issued shares in the past two months to reduce debt. That brings funds raised in the first three months of the year to about $8 billion, more than 10 times the total in the same period last year. As the continued slide in oil prices further crimps cash flows, banks are pressuring these companies to shore up their capital and reduce debt to lower servicing costs and provide wiggle room. \u201cThere aren\u2019t really any better alternatives right now,\u201d Chad Mabry, an analyst at MLV & Co. LLC in Houston, said in a telephone interview. A growing acceptance that low prices will persist has convinced producers to turn to equity markets while they still can, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re preparing for the worst.\u201d Few saw issuing new stock as an attractive option when the oil market first started crashing late last year because it would dilute the value of stock held by existing shareholders at a time when their holdings already were hurt by falling prices. As recently as December and January, many producers assumed there would be little interest in pouring more money into the sector, and that funding from debt or equity wouldn\u2019t materialize, said Rob Santangelo, co-head of equity capital markets Americas for Credit Suisse Group AG. That began to change in February when prices seemed to stabilize and frozen credit and equity markets opened up. The $8 billion in stock issued in the first three months of 2015 is the highest of any quarter in more than a decade. If the pace continues, sales of new equity would surpass the total of 2008 and 2009 combined, the last time oil prices crashed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The surge in equity offerings, even with the dilution of existing shareholders, now is widely considered the lesser of evils versus expensive borrowing or asset sales at reduced prices, said Troy Eckard, whose Eckard Global LLC owns stakes in more than 260 North Dakota shale wells. \u201cEquity does not have to be paid back and requires no disbursements of revenue and net profits,\u201d Eckard said. \u201cIt buys into your plan and works for companies that can make it through the downturn in commodity prices.\u201d Investors are coming to the table in the belief they are buying in at the bottom of the market and will reap gains in the long-term as oil prices recover, said Christian O\u2019Neill, an energy analyst at T. Rowe Price International Inc., which owns shares in numerous producers. \u201cMany executives are expecting a longer downturn,\u201d O\u2019Neill said in an interview. \u201cSome companies that have issued shares have attractive long-term growth profiles. For others it is a function of trying to survive and buy themselves more time.\u201d Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc., which has debt that makes up a far lower percentage of its market value than other shale producers, announced March 16 an offering of $204 million worth of stock to pay down debt. Carrizo\u2019s debt hasn\u2019t traded at a significant discount in the past six months, a sign that investors are bullish about its prospects. \u201cWe like that Carrizo is taking advantage of an open market to shore up the balance sheet,\u201d Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. wrote March 17 in a note to investors. Encana and Noble, both of which have retained investment-grade credit ratings, have each sold shares as well, offering about $1 billion each this month and last month, respectively. Even successful equity offerings come at a price in today\u2019s market. To raise that $1 billion late last month, Noble had to sell 21 million shares at a price of $47.50 each. Six months ago when its stock traded for $76.71 a share, the Houston-based company would have sold 13 million shares to raise the same amount. Carrizo\u2019s offering of 4.5 million shares for $45.50, which generated about $205 million in cash, would have required just 3.2 million shares in June, when the Houston-based company\u2019s shares sold for about $65 apiece. Equity sales by producers in a weaker position have not been as readily embraced by the market. Houston-based Rosetta Resources Inc.\u2019s shares fell 6.5 percent after announcing a $204 million offering March 9. Since June, when crude began to decline, Rosetta\u2019s market capitalization has fallen 63 percent while debt is $2 billion. That ratio of debt to market value is higher than average compared to 73 companies that specialize in shale production, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oil companies that   record amounts over the past several years to accelerate drilling during the boom days have swelled the U.S. market for energy-related high-yield bonds to $201 billion from $65.6 billion at the end of 2007, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The extra yield, or spread, that bond investors are demanding to own the typical junk-rated energy security has more than doubled since June to 7.44 percentage points above government debt, the index shows. That compares to an average spread of 4.82 points since the inception of the data in 1996, suggesting investors see higher risk and an uglier outlook for the industry. As oil prices continue to fall, reaching a six-year low of $43.46 a barrel on March 17, funding options are becoming increasingly limited. Fewer companies are willing or able to buy assets as debt becomes increasingly expensive, and operators who have painstakingly built up their drilling land holdings over years are loath to part with them if they can find alternatives. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, gained 3.9 percent to $45.69 a barrel at 10:01 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Investor appetite for new shares of smaller companies may be short lived, forcing those companies to use debt and other sources of funding at significantly higher rates, analysts from Bank of Nova Scotia said in a note Wednesday. Hedge fund and private equity investors including Blackstone Group LP and KKR & Co. are raising billions for new funds created in the past few months to invest in distressed oil producers. Many banks are working with producers to help them manage their balance sheets and reduce debt as they face a potential reduction of their borrowing limits, said Eric Scheyer, the head of hedge fund Magnetar Capital\u2019s energy business, who oversees a group that manages nearly $4 billion. \u201cWhen companies are looking at an environment where the price of crude is very uncertain, they need to manage liquidity,\u201d said Scheyer, whose firm invests in the equity and debt of energy producers. \u201cFor some, they don\u2019t issue debt because their leverage levels are too high, they have debt-to-equity levels that are substantially different than they were last summer.\u201d","timestamp":1426816803.0,"participant_ids":["CRZO:US","NBL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-20\/shale-producers-have-found-another-lifeline-shareholders","subject":"Shale Producers Have Found Another Lifeline: Shareholders"},{"body":" Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd. sold most of its stake in Aviva Plc before shareholders approved the U.K. insurer\u2019s takeover of Friends Life Group Plc.

The investment firm, with about $25 billion under management, is acquiring Five Ten Capital, a rental business with more than 1,500 houses in states including Florida, Illinois and Texas, said two people with knowledge of the deal. New York-based Cerberus also is hiring Five Ten\u2019s founder, Rob Bloemker, to oversee the rental business and play a role in broader mortgage investments, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The rental-home industry is consolidating as smaller operators without the advantages of scale cash out. Two years after it started lending to landlords, Cerberus will now be one itself, betting that it can use financial-market expertise to boost returns even after a 24 percent gain nationally in home prices from a low in December 2011. \u201cNow people are able to come in and build debt into the equation, whereas, for the pioneers in the space, this was all being done with equity,\u201d Rich Ford, a managing director in Jefferies Group LLC\u2019s real estate investment-banking group, said in a telephone interview. Bloemker declined to comment on the company\u2019s sale to Cerberus and any future role with the firm. Peter Duda, a spokesman for Cerberus, also declined to comment. The people with knowledge of the deal didn\u2019t disclose financial terms. Since the housing crash, Wall Street-backed firms, led by Blackstone Group LP, have institutionalized the historically mom and pop business of renting single-family homes. Real estate investment trusts, private-equity firms and hedge funds have spent at least $25 billion purchasing more than 150,000 houses since 2012, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. Unlike competitors that started buying distressed property years earlier, Cerberus will be under less pressure to depend on home-price appreciation now that securitization markets have opened up to the largest operators. The low-interest-rate debt provides landlords leverage to increase returns on their investments. \u201cAs home prices have gone up, invariably, investment returns have come down,\u201d said Laurie Goodman, director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute in Washington. \u201cIf you use leverage, you can bring them back up, and that\u2019s exactly what firms are doing.\u201d Since November 2013, Wall Street has issued more than $8 billion of securities tied to almost 60,000 houses owned by companies including Blackstone and Thomas Barrack Jr.\u2019s Colony Capital. American Homes 4 Rent this week is offering more than $522 million of the debt. U.S. home prices rose 0.8 percent in December from November, more than economists  , the Federal Housing Finance Agency said in a report Thursday. Cerberus already has a multimillion-dollar investment in the industry through its FirstKey Holdings unit, which lends to the smaller landlords who make up the majority of the market and have limited ability to finance their purchases. Cerberus, Blackstone and Colony are racing to package the debt on homes managed by separate landlords for the first multiborrower-bond sale, which Morningstar Inc. is expecting within the next two to three months, according to Brian Grow, a managing director at the Chicago-based research company. The largest landlords slowed their purchases as prices rose. Jonathan Gray, Blackstone\u2019s global head of real estate, said last March that \u201cthe institutional wave has passed.\u201d Single-family home purchases by institutional investors fell 31 percent in 2014 to about 105,000 properties, the fewest in four years, according to RealtyTrac, which counts buyers of at least 10 houses in a one-year period among the group. Some early entrants have begun selling homes to profit from price gains, return cash to investors or find higher returns elsewhere. Cerberus\u2019s rental-home business could expand with bulk purchases, to attain the benefits of scale and attempt to catch up with competitors who got an earlier start. The larger companies with more financing options have found ways to use their size to cut costs and increase efficiencies, such as bringing property management in-house and buying flooring and appliances wholesale from national suppliers. \u201cThere\u2019s a big opportunity for consolidation, and there is an opportunity to aggregate and finance the portfolios of mom and pops through securitization,\u201d said Jade Rahmani, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s the same addressable market from two vantage points.\u201d This month, Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp., the first single-family-rental firm to go public, agreed to buy about 2,460 houses owned by Aaron Edelheit\u2019s The American Home for   in one of the industry\u2019s largest bulk purchases. \u201cOver the past 12 to 18 months, we have seen an increasing number of portfolios cross our desk,\u201d Silver Bay Chief Executive Officer David Miller said on an earnings conference call Thursday. The American Home deal will bring Silver Bay\u2019s total portfolio to about 9,200 homes, he said. \u201cThe companies with the lowest cost of capital win,\u201d Edelheit said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cThe American Home did not have the lowest cost of capital.\u201d While Salt Lake City-based Five Ten is small compared to landlords such as Blackstone, which has 47,000 homes, it was one of the earliest rental-home firms to get institutional capital. Deutsche Bank AG arranged a $100 million credit facility for the company in April 2013. Bloemker started Five Ten in 2011. He previously worked as head of fixed income at Putnam Investments after mortgage-related roles at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Salomon Brothers. He also co-founded financing company Dwell, which competed with Cerberus\u2019s FirstKey in offering loans to landlords. One of Five Ten\u2019s funds, started in December 2011, had a net return of 51 percent through November, according to an investor letter obtained by Bloomberg News. Other funds, with inception dates in 2012 and 2013, have gained 33 percent and 12 percent, respectively. The firm made a 60 percent to 75 percent profit from selling most of its Phoenix properties to individual homeowners, according to the letter. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had unsolicited offers for large portions of our leased properties as institutional investors continue to ferret out yield opportunities in a low-interest-rate environment,\u201d Bloemker said in the letter. Cerberus, founded in 1992 by Stephen Feinberg and William Richter, invests in private-equity deals, distressed assets and real estate, and also originates loans. Among its high-profile deals were purchases in 2006 and 2007 of majority stakes in Chrysler LLC and GMAC, the former financing arm of General Motors. Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, and GMAC received a government bailout. Cerberus still owns a stake in Ally Financial Inc., formerly GMAC and now publicly traded. Cerberus recouped most or all of its Chrysler investment. Now Cerberus is seeking to profit from the lingering effects of the housing crisis, which left more than 5 million foreclosed homes and damaged the credit of families hoping to buy again. The U.S. homeownership rate, which soared to a record 69.2 percent in 2004, is at 64 percent, back where it was  , according to the Census Bureau. The country\u2019s worst rental-housing shortage in more than a decade is giving landlords the ability to raise rents more aggressively. Rents on all single-family homes and multifamily units are expected to climb 3.5 percent this year, compared with a 2.5 percent increase for home purchase prices, according to Zillow Group Inc. Chief Economist Stan Humphries. \u201cHow attractive this investment is depends on your view on two sources of potential upside: rental increases and further home-price appreciation,\u201d said Goodman of the Urban Institute. \u201cAnd to the extent you add leverage, you are magnifying those bets.\u201d (Earlier versions of this story were corrected to change the characterization of Cerberus\u2019s GMAC and Chrysler investments and correct the spelling of Salomon Brothers.)","timestamp":1424941680.0,"participant_ids":["BX:US","SBY:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-26\/cerberus-becoming-landlord-to-catch-boom-in-rental-homes","subject":"Cerberus Joins the Wall Street Landlord Club"},{"body":"JPMorgan Chase & Co. is making two contrarian calls: First that the yen will strengthen toward 100 per dollar and second that such a rally won\u2019t destroy the world\u2019s third-largest economy. Tohru Sasaki, Tokyo-based head of Japan markets research, sees a gain to 110 next year from about 121 now, the most bullish among around 60 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. While Sasaki sees the equilibrium exchange rate at \u201cbelow 100,\u201d he doesn\u2019t see that as spelling the end for the recovery in corporate profits. \u201cWhat investors like to hear is that the yen is weak and stocks are up -- but if everyone\u2019s constantly betting that way, at some point they\u2019re going to get burned,\u201d Sasaki, who worked at the Bank of Japan for more than a decade before joining JPMorgan in 2003, said in a Dec. 18 interview. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that equity prices keep going up forever, because everyone is working to maximize their returns. But in the forex market, it will never happen -- there\u2019s an up and down.\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s view clashes with the consensus among analysts for the yen to slide to 125 per dollar next year, which would complete a five-year decline of 38 percent. A weakening exchange rate under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has underpinned a doubling of stock prices as profits swelled to an all-time high. While selling the currency and buying equities became so prevalent that analysts dubbed it the  , Sasaki says investors are overly obsessed with the exchange rate. Sasaki\u2019s projection is predicated on a rebound in Japan\u2019s current account surplus, which reached its   since 2008 in March. In the first 10 months, the surfeit in the broadest measure of trade amounted to 13.3 trillion yen, more than five times the 2.6 trillion yen registered in all of 2014. The yen has also become \u201csignificantly\u201d undervalued after the BOJ\u2019s trade-weighted index slid to an eight-year low in June, according to Sasaki. A Bloomberg gauge of consumer purchasing power parity shows the yen is 39 percent undervalued compared to the dollar, the most among major currencies. It\u2019s not the first time JPMorgan has gone against the grain. Sasaki\u2019s   for the currency to rally in the first half of 2014 proved prescient. In the second half of the same year, he\u00a0escalated\u00a0his forecast for yen weakness following a surprise BOJ easing, predicting 120 per dollar for Sept. 30 of this year. It closed that day at 119.88 and was recently at 120.92. While he\u2019s now in the minority among yen forecasters, the ranks of   are swelling. Seventeen analysts now see gains to at least 120 next year, versus 13 on Nov. 30. Many bears are counting on BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to drive weakness, after two rounds of stimulus since April 2013 helped push the currency to a 13-year low of 125.86 per dollar in June.\u00a0Analysts are almost\u00a0  on the chances of an expansion of the quantitative and qualitative easing program. JPMorgan sees additional QQE late in 2016 having no lasting impact on the yen. JPMorgan predicts Japan\u2019s economy will expand 1.1 percent in 2016, matching the median estimate from more than 50 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s after growth ground to a halt in 2014 following a sales-tax increase that April. Brokerages are more   on Japanese stocks, even as they expect earnings growth to decline for the first time since 2012. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average will surge 18 percent to 22,250 by the end of 2016, according forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Yen declines are slowing, with this year\u2019s 1 percent loss just a fraction of the at-least 11 percent tumbles each year from 2012. Hedge funds are also closing bets on depreciation, slashing so-called net shorts by the most since August in the week to Dec. 15, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Sasaki expects an unwinding of bearish positions among domestic investors too, driving the yen to 115 by March 31 next year. They include\u00a0the\u00a08.5 trillion yen in bets against the yen, 10 trillion yen in overseas holdings of investment trusts and the 50 trillion yen in retained earnings at Japanese corporations that could see increased hedging, JPMorgan estimates. \u201cDifferent from past episodes of the yen carry trade, this time the major sellers of the yen are Japanese,\" he said, referring to a strategy where investors borrow yen cheaply to invest in higher-yielding nations. \u201cJapanese will need to unwind those positions eventually. The yen is no longer the ideal funding currency.\u201d Funding carry trades in yen lost money against every major currency\u00a0in the second half except the New Zealand dollar. Neither the BOJ nor politicians want additional weakness, as wage gains have failed to keep pace with surging food prices, squeezing consumers,\u00a0according to Sasaki. The yen drop also spurred a record number of   among small- and medium-sized businesses dependent on imported materials. JPMorgan sees its benefits as exaggerated. \u201cThe economy is not driven only by the foreign-exchange rate,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cIf the growth momentum is strong, I think the Japanese economy can overcome it.\u201d","timestamp":1450875660.0,"participant_ids":["JPM:US","8301:JP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-23\/jpmorgan-says-japan-inc-must-prepare-for-yen-below-100-a-dollar","subject":"JPMorgan Says Japan Inc.

Vladimir Gersamia, a former trader at Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd., may be charged within a week, Judge Bernard Eder said at a hearing in London Wednesday, citing a statement filed by Gersamia\u2019s attorney. Otkritie sought an order requiring Gersamia to hand over his U.K. passport. Otkritie won $150 million in a lawsuit last year against former employees whom Eder said had siphoned money from the Moscow-based bank to pay for luxury villas, diamonds and Ferraris. Threadneedle blocked a suspicious $150 million trade Gersamia tried to put through and dismissed him in 2011. Eder ordered Gersamia, a dual U.K.-Georgian citizen, to hand over the passport until next month because there was \u201ca significant risk\u201d that he would flee the court\u2019s jurisdiction. New evidence emerged at the hearing that police will decide whether to charge Gersamia by Feb. 10, Eder said. \u201cThe evidence before me now is that a charge is likely,\u201d Eder said. \u201cThat seems to me a relevant matter that I can and should take into account.\u201d Eder cited a statement submitted by Gersamia\u2019s lawyer, Karen Todner, who declined to comment after the hearing or provide a copy of the statement. The Crown Prosecution Service also declined to comment. Bart Casella, another lawyer for Gersamia, told the court that his client should be able to keep the passport because he had made five trips abroad since October, despite the three-year police probe and returned to the U.K. every time. Casella said Gersamia had come to the U.K. when he was 15, was currently employed there, lived at the same address for more than three years and made the country his home. Ella Tekdag, a spokeswoman for Threadneedle, declined to comment other than to confirm Gersamia worked at the asset-management firm from August 2010 to August 2011. Gersamia took part with other defendants in an Argentinian warrants fraud. His role was to help by pretending, if necessary, that Threadneedle was the counterparty with Otkritie Securities Ltd. in the sale and buy-back of the warrants, according to Eder\u2019s judgment in the case last year. The warrant fraud was committed by manipulating the U.S. dollar-Argentine peso exchange rates. In his ruling, Eder called the case \u201cnothing less than a brazen and carefully orchestrated deceit.\u201d Fraud proceeds were laundered through offshore companies and bank accounts.

Wall Street landlords bought thousands of homes and sold stock to the public before they\u2019d even filled many of the properties with renters. Now those companies are struggling to persuade investors they can operate efficient businesses. Shares of the four publicly traded U.S. home-rental firms are below their 2012 to 2013 initial offering prices and have fallen as much as 5 percent in the past month. The companies are learning to operate at the same time they\u2019re trying to please investors, unlike landlords backed by Blackstone Group LP, Colony Capital Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumnus Don Mullen, which haven\u2019t turned to equity markets for capital. \u201cCompanies should be built privately,\u201d said John Bartling, chief executive officer of Blackstone\u2019s Invitation Homes, the largest U.S. owner of single-family properties. \u201cUnless you can communicate it and forecast it well, you\u2019re going to struggle with investors as they try to determine how to forecast your earnings.\u201d Blackstone, with almost 50,000 houses, has indicated it\u2019s in no rush to take Invitation Homes public as a real estate investment trust. Jonathan Gray, head of real estate at the New York-based firm,   in April that \u201cat some point in the next 12 or 24 months, we\u2019ll have a business that can come public.\u201d Bartling declined to comment on any IPO plans. For those already public  -- American Homes 4 Rent, American Residential Properties Inc., Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. and Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust -- shares are trading below the value of the underlying assets, according to Haendel St. Juste, a Morgan Stanley analyst. Some earnings reports this month disappointed investors as expenses remained unpredictable, prompting renewed questions about the prospect of managing thousands of scattered properties. \u201cIn hindsight, the timing of their going public could be viewed as a mistake,\u201d said Jade Rahmani, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. \u201cThey had to grow under a microscope and have generated less income so far than investors expected. They should basically be looked at as startups.\u201d American Homes 4 Rent, the largest single-family rental company after Blackstone, with about 37,500 homes, fell the most ever on Aug. 7 after reporting second-quarter earnings. The Agoura Hills, California-based landlord showed higher-than-expected costs when properties got new tenants. The stock dropped 11 percent in the past year to $15.68, below the IPO price of $16 in July 2013. \u201cThe Achilles heel of the thing is they have not been able to consistently show control over unit expenses, particularly around high turnover periods,\u201d said Reed Cassady, a senior research analyst at Legg Mason Inc.\u2019s ClearBridge Investments, which owned 4.4 million shares as of June 30. \u201cThey\u2019ve demonstrated that the model works outside of that one issue.\u201d American Homes 4 Rent is working on ways to manage costs of repairs and maintenance, Chief Operating Officer John Corrigan said on an Aug. 7 conference call with investors. \u201cThere is some low-hanging fruit, but many initiatives will take longer to execute,\u201d he said. These firms are reaching limits of their ability to raise capital because they can\u2019t issue more stock without hurting current shareholders, said Dave Bragg, a residential REIT analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, California. \u201cAmerican Homes 4 Rent doesn\u2019t have any sort of cost-of-capital advantage that would allow them to go out and issue stock and buy assets and grow the portfolio,\u201d Bragg said. Apartment REITs, which have a long history, are more attractive to investors -- and have performed better this year - - because they have more consistent costs than scattered rental houses, said Anthony Paolone, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst. Single-family landlords are \u201ccompeting against the regular apartment space, which is performing incredibly well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche that\u2019s finding its way in the public markets.\u201d Shares of American Residential Properties are trading at 15 percent below their May 2013 IPO price and are down about 3.8 percent in the last 12 months. The performance has drawn criticism from activist investor Jonathan Litt, co-founder of Land & Buildings Investment Management. Litt, whose firm held 1.5 percent of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based landlord\u2019s shares as of June 30, advised CEO Stephen Schmitz to raise the stock price by the end of 2015 by repurchasing stock with proceeds from sales of some of its roughly 9,000 houses. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m hopeful he\u2019d be open to selling the company,\u201d Litt said in an interview. Schmitz responded to Litt\u2019s urgings for asset sales and buybacks on an Aug. 6 conference call. \u201cAs we get towards the end of the year, obviously we\u2019ve got to take a hard look,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve ruled out by any stretch.\u201d Schmitz and American Homes 4 Rent CEO David Singelyn didn\u2019t reply to requests seeking comment. Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust, which owns about 12,500 homes and is backed by Starwood Capital Group\u2019s Barry Sternlicht, is down 5.8 percent in the past 12 months. The firm is being unfairly judged by the performance of its peers, according to CEO Doug Brien. \u201cEven though we have raised our guidance range and delivered on the expectations we have set, we are seemingly lumped in with others that do not have the operating history nor the performance we have produced,\u201d Brien said in an e-mail. The Oakland, California-based company is the only one of the REITs to rise in the past month, with a 1.6 percent increase. Silver Bay, which is also trading below its December 2012 IPO price of $18.50, is using sales of homes in Southern California and Atlanta to pay debt and repurchase shares.\u00a0Anh Huynh, a spokeswoman for the Plymouth, Minnesota-based landlord, declined to comment. Invitation Homes is   that don\u2019t fit its strategy, including about 1,300 in Atlanta. The company is continuing to buy properties and hone operations without the same investor scrutiny that\u2019s plaguing its public peers. \u201cWe are still investing actively through the private equity markets, but always have an eye on the public markets,\u201d Bartling said.","timestamp":1439877662.0,"participant_ids":["BX:US","ARPI:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-18\/blackstone-bides-time-for-home-rental-reit-as-stocks-sag","subject":"Blackstone Bides Time for Home-Rental REIT as Stocks Sag"},{"body":"\u201cWe\u2019re not at war -- we care about the same things,\u201d FBI Director\u00a0James Comey says of the struggle between the U.S. and the tech sector over how private your smartphone should be. The government wants to work with companies such as Apple Inc. and Google to stop criminals and terrorists from exploiting the encryption technology built into some smartphone operating systems, Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0last week,\u00a0echoing\u00a0President Barack Obama\u2019s  .\u00a0U.S. officials warn it can be used to conceal evidence or plots, as it may have in the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, and\u00a0want a way to crack a phone when they believe it holds vital information.\u00a0 The industry says encryption and other barriers are there to protect your personal data from falling into the hands of hackers or snoops -- or, some say, the government itself.\u00a0 \u201cWeakening security with the aim of advancing security simply does not make sense,\u201d the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents 62 of the largest tech companies in the world, said in a  . All this comes as a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, is deciding whether to force Apple to unlock an iPhone seized in a drug probe, at the behest of the U.S. Here\u2019s what you need to know. A hundred. Twelve. It doesn\u2019t matter -- if it\u2019s encrypted, they can\u2019t. Encryption -- the coding of information into gibberish, indecipherable without the password -- and other protections are becoming so formidable that even criminal investigators with search warrants can be locked out of a smartphone. The U.S. has forced devices open by entering \u201cevery possible pass code,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy said during a hearing in the Brooklyn case. But that\u2019s risky. Some iPhones erase all data if the wrong code is entered 10 times. Apple doesn\u2019t even keep a \u201cmaster key\u201d anymore, to gain access to an iPhone when presented with a warrant, said John Kindervag, a tech analyst at Forrester Research. Google has been rolling out similar protections for its Android operating system. Android 5.0 Lollipop offered \u201cfull disk encryption\u201d by default on some devices. Enhancements were added for 6.0 Marshmallow. Smartphones are becoming \u201ctechnological bank vaults,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said last month in a white paper, which noted that his office has 111 cases in which encryption has prevented access to phone data. Unless companies make changes, he said, \u201ccrimes will go unsolved.\u201d Well, it\u2019s partly its fault. \u201cOne of the reasons the government has received such skepticism from companies and consumers\u201d over access to phone data \u201cis that it has spent the last two decades trying to strip every privacy protection from cellphones,\u201d said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. Turley,\u00a0a civil-liberties advocate who has been critical of the government\u2019s handling of such issues, called the Obama administration \u201cone of the worst for privacy protections.\u201d Administration officials declined to comment on that claim. Tech companies announced new encryption methods after   leaked information in 2013 about mass phone and Internet surveillance by the U.S. Around the same time that Apple and Google were working on new security standards to address consumers\u2019 worries about snooping, Turley said, U.S. officials were lobbying the companies to make smartphones less attractive to thieves and hackers, spurring still more data protection technologies. \u201cThe irony is both government and defrauders have the same interest in cellphones,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a wonderful reservoir of personal information, data and communications.\u201d FBI officials joined with Vance, the Manhattan D.A., in November to request that tech companies develop a measure that would allow searches with a warrant. Vance suggested in his white paper that Apple and Google be required by statute to maintain a means of bypassing user codes if the government obtains a court order. Among the evidence found on smartphones, the paper cited \u201cphotos and videos of child sexual assault; text messages between sex traffickers and their customers; even a video of a murder victim being shot to death.\u201d Vance said he and other law enforcement officials don\u2019t support a \u201cgovernment-held key,\u201d or back door, for smartphones, an idea that outrages privacy advocates. While some of them have argued that the cloud, or remote data storage offered by Apple and Google among others, removes the need to get into the devices themselves, Vance said that some information, such as certain text messages, may be available only on the phone. Plus, use of cloud storage is optional. As for a statute, Forrester\u2019s Kindervag said\u00a0companies that resist the pressure to bend on privacy will be seen as \u201cheroic.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think Congress scares Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Apple scares Congress.\u201d U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in Brooklyn is still weighing the Justice Department\u2019s request to make Apple give the government access to the seized iPhone. He expressed skepticism during the hearing that federal law provides for the help prosecutors are seeking. They are pushing for an answer despite a guilty plea in the underlying drug case, saying the probe continues and they need more evidence. More broadly, the government is talking to tech companies to find \u201cadditional ways of making it even harder to for terrorists or criminals to find refuge in cyberspace,\u201d an Obama administration official said in a statement. So far the companies aren\u2019t budging. None want to be the first to risk losing customers, said Kevin Burden, an analyst with 451 Research who covers the mobile-device industry. \u201cApple has taken itself out of the middle ... where it can be used\u201d in a way that would \u201ccompromise the security and privacy of consumer devices,\u201d Marc Zwillinger, a lawyer for the company, said at a hearing in October in Orenstein\u2019s court. The phone in the Brooklyn case runs an earlier version of iOS that Apple says it may be able to access -- and that prosecutors say Apple told the U.S. it definitely can access. Later versions cannot be accessed without the pass code, Zwillinger said. Fred Sainz, a spokesman for Apple, and Liz Markman, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment. To Kindervag, it\u2019s \u201cinconceivable that there\u2019s even a technological middle ground.\u201d Still, the government will keep up the pressure on the tech companies, he predicted, using the recent acts of terrorism \u201cto try to to create a sense of fear in hopes they can sway public opinion.\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said at a conference in October he was opposed to \"a back door that\u2019s only for the good guys.\" In a back room or a courtroom, something\u2019s got to give.","timestamp":1450166400.0,"participant_ids":["AAPL:US","GOOGL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-15\/the-government-wants-access-to-smartphones-what-you-should-know","subject":"The Government Wants Access to Smartphones.

Etihad, the biggest shareholder in Air Berlin with a 29 percent stake, is examining the ruling by the administrative court of the state of Lower Saxony and expects to file an appeal next week, the Abu Dhabi-based carrier said Wednesday in a statement. The company stands by its German partner, it said. German regulators provided a   until mid-January to the airlines\u2019 code-sharing pact on the routes in October, when clearance was set to expire. Judges at the court in Braunschweig ruled on Wednesday that Etihad and Air Berlin must halt the practice from Jan. 16 through the end of the seasonal schedule in March because the services aren\u2019t covered by air traffic accords between the United Arab Emirates and Germany. Another 50 routes that the carriers offer on a code-sharing basis are unaffected by the ruling, the court said. \u201cEtihad Airways is deeply disappointed by the German court\u2019s decision handed down today,\u201d the airline said. \u201cThe social and economic damage to Germany by this decision is significant.\u201d German and U.A.E. officials disagree over whether the sales partnership, which allows the carriers to book seats on each other\u2019s flights and share some revenue, is covered by current flight-rights treaties on those services. Etihad Chief Executive Officer James Hogan, who has bought stakes in other airlines including Air Berlin, said in October the key reason his company invested in the German carrier was for the code sharing routes and that failure to approve them would severely damage the partner. The court decision \"materially reduces competition and consumer choice within and beyond Germany and causes inconvenience to passengers,\" Etihad said on Wednesday. The company and Air Berlin said separately that all booked itineraries will be honored. The ruling confirms the German government\u2019s legal assessment, while Etihad and Air Berlin have had time since receiving initial temporary clearance in August 2014 to adjust their schedules to the rules,\u00a0the Transport Ministry said in a statement.

Nexstar would pay $17.66 a share for Media General in cash and stock, it said in a statement Thursday. Minutes later, Meredith released a statement, offering to amend the terms of its current agreement with Media General to pay about $18.84 a share. Media General, in its own statement, said it has made several proposals to Meredith to end their deal so that it can proceed with Nexstar. Meredith has been unwilling to accept a termination, Media General said. Meredith is still willing to negotiate terms on its new agreement, Chief Executive Stephen Lacy said in a statement. \u201cGiven the compelling and superior value inherent in this proposal, we ask that the Media General board of directors re-enter serious negotiations around the merger of equals structure and its merits,\u201d Lacy said. Media General rejected an offer from Nexstar last month of $16.31 a share. Media General agreed to acquire Meredith Corp. for $2.4 billion in September. Before announcing the proposed amended terms for a combination with Media General, Meredith made an offer to break off the deal under certain conditions. Those included buying three Media General television stations for a discounted price, an additional $20 million in breakup fee, and two of Media General\u2019s digital businesses, according to people familiar with the matter. Media General, after conferring with Nexstar, countered by offering to sell Meredith two of the three stations it wanted and two other stations, no additional money, and one of the digital businesses, one of the people said. Media General wouldn\u2019t sell the stations Meredith wanted at a discount, the people said. Media General did offer to pay Meredith its $60 million break fee now, rather than after a failed shareholder vote and a completed deal between Nexstar and Media General, the people said. Negotiations between Meredith and Media General broke down after Meredith rejected Media General\u2019s counter-proposal, they said. Spokespeople at Meredith, Media General and Nexstar declined to comment. Nexstar\u2019s offer breaks down to $10.55 in cash and 0.1249 share of Nexstar Class A common stock, based on its closing price Wednesday, it said. The company said it has committed financing for the transaction for approximately $4.7 billion, and intends to sell some TV stations to get regulatory approval for a combination. The proposal also includes a contingent value right, which gives Media General shareholders a part of net cash proceeds from the sale of Media General\u2019s spectrum in a U.S. government auction this year. Meredith\u2019s amended proposal of about $18.84 a share, which it called a merger of equals, includes $3.90 a share in cash and one share of the new company valued at $14.94 each. The equity price is based on an implied, pro forma value of the combined company at a multiple of nine times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the statement shows. Meredith\u2019s offer also includes a contingent value right, representing after-tax proceeds from the sale of Media General\u2019s spectrum in the upcoming auction, that could be valued at as much as $4.29 a share. If Meredith holds out and refuses to terminate the September deal, it could force a shareholder vote at Media General, meaning Nexstar may have to wait until the second half of 2016 or longer to complete a deal. If Nexstar and Media General enter a merger agreement during a Federal Communications Commission quiet period related to the spectrum auction, the FCC won\u2019t process and approve it until after the auction concludes. The quiet period begins Jan. 12. Shares of Nexstar dropped 7.1 percent to $52.84 at the close in New York. Media General rose 2.2 percent to $16.12, while Meredith declined 6.2 percent to $38.90. Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch is acting as financial adviser to Nexstar, with Kirkland & Ellis providing legal advice. RBC Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are advising Media General, alongside lawyers at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson and Weil Gotshal & Manges.

The company\u2019s response underscored the importance of fuel-economy metrics in Pratt\u2019s competition with General Electric Co. to power narrow-body jets, the biggest and most lucrative segment of the global airline fleet. Pratt has promised a 15 percent fuel savings on its so-called geared-turbofan engine, whose development has required an investment of about $10 billion. United Technologies said Dec. 10 that uneven cooling in the engine may cause bowing and result in some parts rubbing together. Running air through the unit for three minutes would eliminate the issue, according to Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Greg Hayes, who said software and engineering fixes were being developed. JPMorgan\u00a0analysts including David Perry and Seth Seifman said changing the software to prolong cooling times automatically may cost an airline its takeoff slot at airports where departure times are crucial, while shortening engineering modifications such as shortening the compressor blades could erode the promised savings in fuel use, \u201calthough the margin of shortfall might be modest.\u201d \u201cBoth solutions have an economic cost,\u201d the JPMorgan analysts said in a note that cited \u201cindustry contacts.\u201d While Pratt\u2019s setbacks may not have a major impact on deliveries, airlines could seek compensation if certain targets aren\u2019t met, and the company may face a cost to fix the glitch, the analysts said. It\u2019s not clear whether the cause relates to production quality or a more serious design flaw, they said. More-efficient engines are a central selling point for the neo, the updated version of Airbus\u2019s top-selling A320 family. The neo is Airbus\u2019s entry in the single-aisle segment with Boeing Co.\u2019s new Max, the overhauled narrow-body that also features new engines. Airbus has said it\u2019s in discussions with the first A320neo customers on their \u201cdelivery milestones,\u201d and that the plane has been certified by both the European Aviation Safety Agency and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.\u00a0Spokesman Justin Dubon said Wednesday that he couldn\u2019t comment on any specific engine issues. Hayes said in his Dec. 10 comments that a new process for the engine planned for February will put \u201csome additional robustness into the bearing housing,\u201d together with some other changes. \u201cYou hope you\u2019ve covered all the bases in the test phase,\u201d said Robert Mann, a former American Airlines executive who is now president of aviation consultant R.W. Mann & Co. \u201cBut sometimes in seeking ultimate performance you get caught out by one or more of the variables. Pretty much every engine has had issues.\u201d Pratt\u2019s model, which incorporates a gear to achieve significant reductions in fuel burn, emissions and noise, competes with an engine from a GE-Safran SA venture to power the neo. Pratt\u2019s PW1100G has a 28 percent market share on ordered A320neos, with the rival Leap on 31 percent and the rest of operators undecided, JPMorgan said. Qatar Airways, long slated to be the first\u00a0A320neo customer, has already balked at taking the first jet amid concern that getting engines to the right temperature will have an effect on its timetable, while India\u2019s Indigo, due to be the third recipient, said this week that Airbus had warned it of a delay in handovers related to unspecified \u201cindustrial reasons.\u201d Deutsche Lufthansa AG, now scheduled to get the first A320neo, said Tuesday it expects to receive a plane this month --\u00a0allowing Airbus to meet its delivery target -- but that the handover won\u2019t be announced because of the holiday season. The media will be notified only once a second aircraft arrives early in the new year, spokesman Thomas Jachnow said.","timestamp":1450868950.0,"participant_ids":["3648287Z:US","JPM:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-23\/airbus-a320neo-engine-fix-seen-as-risk-to-promised-fuel-savings","subject":"Airbus Supplier Pratt Defends Engines Amid JPMorgan Fuel Doubts"},{"body":"Anheuser-Busch InBev NV Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito, attempting to allay concerns of U.S. lawmakers and craft brewers about the company\u2019s proposed $110 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc, said the deal would increase domestic beer competition, not weaken it. While the megamerger would open new markets for AB InBev, Brito said it wouldn\u2019t boost the Budweiser maker\u2019s market position in the U.S. To make sure that\u2019s the case, the Leuven, Belgium-based company plans to sell SABMiller\u2019s 58 percent stake in MillerCoors to joint-venture partner Molson Coors Brewing Co. for $12 billion as it seeks to gain approval from the U.S. Justice Department. \u201cThe purpose of this transaction is to enhance our ability to serve new markets, particularly in Africa, Asia and Central and South America,\u201d Brito said Tuesday in Washington at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing. \u201cIf anything, our divestiture of SABMiller\u2019s interest in MillerCoors will create an even more competitive marketplace, building upon what is already a golden age of consumer choice in American brewing.\u201d The hearing was called to examine the impact of the merger, which would create an entity accounting for about half the industry\u2019s profit and almost a third of all beer sold worldwide. The combined company would hold the No. 1 or No. 2 positions in 24 of the world\u2019s 30 largest beer markets. The Senate subcommittee has no power to block the merger. Brito said the merger would not only keep competition in the U.S. beer industry where it is today, but would in fact boost Molson Coors\u2019s ability to operate. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said brewer consolidation over the past few years has created \u201cbeer behemoths\u201d that have harmed consumers. AB Inbev\u2019s takeover, he said, should be viewed with a \u201chigh degree of skepticism.\u201d \u201cThrough the eyes of consumers, the result has been higher prices,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cThese megamergers may have been good for shareholders, but not so much for beer drinkers.\u201d The Justice Department may need to put conditions on the deal before clearing it,\u00a0Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said after the hearing. Regulators should seek a \u201cfully independent\u201d Molson Coors and ensure continued competition from craft brewers, she said. \u201cThere should be some conditions to protect this growing industry in the U.S., which is all about U.S. jobs,\u201d Klobuchar said. Brito repeatedly told senators that the deal wouldn\u2019t affect craft brewers and their access to consumers. The U.S. beer market \u201chas never been so competitive and so open,\u201d he said. Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said he wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cNobody wants to take a seat at a bar and discover their only choices are between a Bud and a Miller,\u201d Coons said. Brito\u2019s comments were contradicted by Bob Pease, CEO of the Brewers Association, which represents the independent craft-beer industry. He cited the beer giant\u2019s influence over U.S. wholesalers as an example of the company\u2019s unfair competitive edge over smaller players. \u201cIn communities where ABI or a closely related wholesaler is one of two choices for a brewer to access the retail market, the wholesale tier is simply not competitive,\u201d he said. Some lawmakers said they wanted to ensure that the deal doesn\u2019t restrict distribution of craft beer or their access to ingredients. If those brewers are \u201csqueezed off the shelf\u201d because AB InBev gains power over distribution, consumer choice will be reduced, said Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat. \u201cI want to make sure they have a level playing field,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them closed out because they can\u2019t distribute.\u201d Brito was joined by Molson Coors CEO Mark Hunter in saying that independent wholesalers will remain unchanged after the merger.\u00a0 \u201cNothing from this transaction will impact any distributor,\u201d Brito said in response to a question from Blumenthal. MillerCoors currently owns one distributor and Molson Coors has no intention of buying others, Hunter said. In the U.S., the merger will change nothing other than removing one of MillerCoors\u2019 two parent brewers, he said. \u201cIt will not change consumer choice, it will not change the competitive pricing environment, it will not change our market share or our longstanding support for the three-tier system, it will not change our support of U.S. growers and suppliers, and it will not change the explosive growth of craft brewers or their access to the market through the MillerCoors distributor network,\u201d he said.\u00a0","timestamp":1449579768.0,"participant_ids":["ABI:BB","SAB:LN","TAP:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-08\/ab-inbev-s-brito-says-megadeal-would-boost-u-s-beer-competition","subject":"AB InBev's Brito Says Deal Would Boost U.S. Beer Competition"},{"body":"Anheuser-Busch InBev NV Chief Executive Offer Carlos Brito will try to ease concerns of U.S. lawmakers about the brewer\u2019s proposed $110 billion acquisition of SAB Miller Plc, which would create an entity accounting for about half the industry\u2019s profit and almost a third of all beer sold worldwide. Brito, Molson Coors Brewing Co. CEO Mark Hunter and other industry officials are scheduled to testify Tuesday in Washington before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel will review how the merger of the world\u2019s two biggest beer producers would affect competitors and consumers. The combined company would hold the No. 1 or No. 2 positions in 24 of the world\u2019s 30 largest beer markets. \u201cThis hearing will provide an opportunity to publicly examine the impact of the so-called \u2018beerhemoth\u2019 merger on consumers and for the Antitrust Subcommittee to continue its oversight of potentially anti-competitive market consolidation,\u201d Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican and chairman of the panel, said in a statement.

The merger plan has drawn scrutiny from senators including Angus King, an independent of Maine, and Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, who wrote to the Justice Department with concerns that it could hurt the U.S. craft beer industry. Senator Ron Wyden, also an Oregon Democrat, wrote to the Federal Trade Commission with concerns over reports that AB InBev and its distributors may have acted to curb competition in markets including his home state of Oregon, where beer drinkers are suing to block the takeover. \u201cWe look forward to the opportunity to discuss the highly competitive U.S. beer market and how this transaction will extend the reach of AB InBev\u2019s iconic American brands, such as Budweiser, to markets outside of the U.S.,\u201d AB InBev spokeswoman Marianne Amssoms said in a statement.

Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the brewer is offering distributors a $1.5 million annual incentive if 98 percent of the beers they sell are AB InBev brands. Andrew Holland, an analyst at Societe Generale, said Brito will tell lawmakers that there will be no change in the structure of the U.S. beer market. \u201cThe bottom line is that AB InBev will not gain one iota of market share in the U.S. from the deal,\u201d Holland said.","timestamp":1449506486.0,"participant_ids":["ABI:BB","SAB:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-07\/ab-inbev-ceo-brito-to-defend-sabmiller-deal-before-congress","subject":"AB InBev CEO Brito to Defend SABMiller Deal Before Congress"},{"body":"Brewers including Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. and buyout firms such as KKR & Co. are among those considering bids for SABMiller Plc\u2019s European beer brands, people familiar with the matter said. The sale of the Peroni and Grolsch brands is attracting interest from\u00a0Spanish beermaker Mahou-San Miguel Group and Cinven, said the people, who asked not to be named because the plans are private. Bids are due in January, and deliberations are at an early stage, the people said. Selling the SABMiller assets would smooth the way for Anheuser-Busch InBev NV\u2019s takeover of the brewer by helping to clear antitrust hurdles in Europe, and could help raise more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), according to some analysts\u2019 estimates. AB InBev is selling assets around the globe to head off potential regulatory issues for the 71.9 billion-pound ($109 billion) deal, dubbed \u201cMegabrew,\u201d that would combine the world\u2019s two largest brewers. Representatives for SABMiller, AB InBev, Asahi, Mahou and Cinven declined to comment. A spokesman for KKR couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment. Sponsors have played a part in some of the beer industry\u2019s recent consolidation.\u00a0In July 2009, KKR acquired Oriental Brewery Co. Ltd.,\u00a0South Korea\u2019s leading brewer, from AB InBev for $1.8 billion. The Budweiser maker reacquired that business in 2014 for $5.8 billion amid slowing demand for mass-market beer in Europe and North America. CVC Capital Partners sold StarBev LP, the maker of Staropramen lager, to Molson Coors Brewing Co. for about $3.5 billion in April 2012 after about three years of ownership. Peroni, an Italian lager that SABMiller picked up in acquisitions between 2003 and 2005, has more than doubled in value since then and may be worth about 938 million euros, according to analysts at Jyske Bank. Dutch beer Grolsch, known for its flip-top bottle cap, hasn\u2019t fared as well. Bought for about 878 million euros in 2008, the company may now fetch about 268 million euros, the brokerage said.

John Cryan, Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s co-chief executive officer since July, said on Thursday the next two years will be tough as plans to shed workers and businesses and revamp technology hurt results. He\u00a0echoed remarks by\u00a0Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse Group AG\u2019s new CEO, who laid out his reorganization plan last week.\u00a0Rising charges for misconduct and restructuring forced\u00a0  to cut its profitability target for 2016. More than seven years after the financial crisis, Europe\u2019s biggest securities firms are still shaking up their businesses to cope with stricter regulation and fines for misleading clients and manipulating markets. The three banks have yet to\u00a0dispel investor doubts about their growth prospects in the face of increasing capital requirements and competition from U.S. rivals. \u201cEuropean investment banks face a tougher time,\u201d said Christian Sole, who helps manage 90.3 billion euros ($99 billion) at Candriam Investors Group in Brussels. \u201cThey\u2019re doing the right thing in cutting costs and retrenching, but two years is an eternity and shareholders will have to learn to be patient for getting a return on their investments.\u201d Deutsche Bank shares posted the biggest loss since August on Thursday, slumping 6.9 percent to 25.59 euros in Frankfurt. Barclays tumbled 6.3 percent in London -- its largest drop in 16 months -- after posting third-quarter earnings that missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Credit Suisse slid 3.6 percent on Oct. 21, the day Thiam announced his strategy. \u201cThere were some really tough messages and probably not what investors had hoped to hear,\u201d Hans-Christoph Hirt, executive director at Hermes EOS, which represents Deutsche Bank investors, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to do most of the work during these two years.\u201d Cryan plans to eliminate Deutsche Bank\u2019s dividend for this year and next to conserve capital. Thiam said last week he would prioritize building up capital over near-term dividend increases, while tapping investors for 6 billion Swiss francs ($6.1 billion) in a stock sale. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the hunt for dividends -- they\u2019re the new interest,\u201d said Boris Boehm, who helps manage about 2.3 billion euros, including Deutsche Bank shares, at Aramea Asset Management in Hamburg. \u201cThere are prettier brides out there.\u201d Cryan told investors that the company will have to spend as much as 3.5 billion euros on severance and restructuring charges to save\u00a0about 3.8 billion euros of gross costs by 2018.\u00a0His plan to cut assets at the investment bank, Deutsche Bank\u2019s largest unit, will cut revenue by about 1.1 billion euros through 2018.\u00a0 Within the trading and investment bank units, the Frankfurt-based firm will reduce its clients by about half, focusing on those that generate the highest revenue. \u201cThe big question is whether earnings increases are even possible in coming years after the drastic asset reduction and cost savings,\u201d Helmut Hipper, a fund manager at Union Investment, one of the company\u2019s top 20 shareholders, said in an e-mail.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no answer yet, that\u2019s why capital markets are skeptical.\u201d Europeans\u2019 portion of investment-banking revenue is already declining, and that\u2019s likely to worsen as firms trim business lines and shut the door on customers, said Mark Williams, author of \u201cUncontrolled Risk,\u201d a book on the rise and collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

Five U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, made up the remainder. \u201cIncreasingly, the major banks are caught in a two-speed world, the growing U.S. economy versus the sputtering European economy,\u201d said Williams, an executive-in-residence at Boston University. \u201cAs the European banks stumble and shrink, the U.S. big six have a unique opportunity to gain greater market share.\u201d Barclays cut the target for its return on equity to 11 percent from 12 percent for 2016. It projected 1 billion pounds of restructuring costs and in the third quarter was hurt by 560 million pounds ($857 million) for misconduct and redress. Finance Director Tushar Morzaria told investors Thursday the London-based firm expects conduct and litigation costs \u201cwill carry on at the kind of elevated levels that we\u2019ve seen.\u201d At Credit Suisse, Thiam intends to invest 1.5 billion francs to spur growth, partly offsetting 3.5 billion francs of planned cost savings. Jobs will be eliminated in the U.S., the U.K. and Switzerland. The restructuring charges mean 2016 \u201cwill be not a good year,\u201d Thiam told investors. Cryan, asked at a press conference why investors should buy into the bank\u2019s restructuring after past efforts fizzled, acknowledged that words would not suffice. \u201cWhat\u2019s different this time?\u201d Cryan asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of believing.

If Anheuser-Busch InBev NV makes good on its pledge to buy SABMiller Plc, the combined entity will probably offload its stake in MillerCoors to pass muster with regulators. The obvious buyer is Molson Coors, which already owns a 42 percent economic interest in the company with a roster of popular brands, including Miller Lite, Coors Light and Blue Moon -- and has the right of first and last offer. Investors are betting on this scenario, pushing up shares of the Denver- and Montreal-based brewer 14 percent to $82.98, an all-time closing high. \u201cIt\u2019s a real opportunity for Molson Coors,\u201d Philip Gorham, an Amsterdam-based analyst at Morningstar Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that Molson Coors is the only buyer in town. Generally, that means they acquire the assets at a good price.\u201d Gorham said it\u2019s highly unlikely AB InBev would have approached SABMiller without getting a nod to divest MillerCoors. \u201cWe are aware of the news, but have no comment,\u201d Molson Coors spokesman Colin Wheeler said. AB InBev has sold assets to get deals done before. To buy Grupo Modelo in 2013, AB InBev sold Grupo Modelo\u2019s U.S. operations to Constellation Brands Inc. \u201cThat was a situation where ABI had to sell,\u201d Gorham said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the same thing here. Depending on what they pay, on the cost and things they can take out of the deal, it\u2019s probably still worth doing for Anheuser-Busch.\u201d Molson\u2019s so-called change-of-control provision gives it an option to take the stake up to 50 percent. Once it reaches that level of ownership, buying the rest makes business sense. According to Ian Shackleton, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., owning all of MillerCoors would add 20 percent or more to earnings per share. The company also could cut costs by streamlining operations. \u201cThere are tons of cost savings if they can own it because the inherent structure creates a lot of extra overhead,\u201d said\u00a0Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman. \u201cNot everything is streamlined the way they hoped it would be so they could close some of that margin gap with AB in the U.S.\u201d While gains and operational cost savings would be bigger if Molson buys all of SABMiller\u2019s 58 percent stake in the joint venture, the family-controlled company could prefer to continue working in a partnership, Shackleton said. He sees a scenario where Heineken NV and Molson buy the brand. \u201cThere are quite close relationships between Molson and Heineken, some family links if you go back way into the mists of time,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, they have some trading links. In Canada, Molson distributes Heineken products, and they actually widened that agreement in the last year. It\u2019s not a case of these guys are totally enemies, quite the opposite.\u201d Heineken is three times the size of Molson and would be better equipped for financing a deal.

Regulators around the world would scrutinize an AB InBev offer for SABMiller and require sales of brands to resolve concerns that the deal could raise prices for consumers, according to antitrust attorneys. Even with increased competition from smaller craft brewers, AB InBev and SABMiller had a combined North American market share in 2014 of 58 percent by volume, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. In the U.S., the companies would have to sell SABMiller\u2019s MillerCoors\u00a0joint venture to win approval from the Justice Department, according to Darren Tucker, an antitrust lawyer at Morgan Lewis & Bockius in Washington. \u201cThe parties will need to make that commitment to have any prospect of passing antitrust muster in the U.S.,\u201d Tucker said. The companies \u201care likely to move quickly to address the Justice Department\u2019s concerns.\u201d Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein agree that the Justice Department will insist on the sale of the MillerCoors stake, adding that Molson Coors Brewing Co., which is based in Denver and Montreal, would be a ready buyer. AB InBev and SABMiller would be facing off against Bill Baer, the head of the department\u2019s antitrust division, who sued to block AB InBev\u2019s takeover of Grupo Modelo SA in 2013. The government complained that the deal could raise prices by further concentrating an industry where AB InBev and MillerCoors controlled the majority of sales. The companies \u201coften find it more profitable to follow each other\u2019s prices than to compete aggressively for market share by cutting price,\u201d the Justice Department said at the time. It settled that lawsuit by requiring the sale of Modelo\u2019s brands to Constellation Brands Inc. The deal may not win Baer\u2019s approval even with a sale of MillerCoors, said\u00a0Allen Grunes, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer, now with Konkurrenz Group in Washington. The antitrust chief has said some deals are so problematic they should never get out of the boardroom, and \u201cit seems this is one of those,\u201d he said. \u201cThis deal is pretty close to unthinkable,\u201d Grunes said. AB Inbev would gain enhanced power as a gatekeeper of distribution that smaller craft brewers rely on to get their products on shelves, said Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in this deal that could warrant its approval by federal antitrust enforcers,\u201d Moss said. If the deal was to be approved, it could take a year with regulators around the globe weighing in, Jennifer Rie, an antitrust analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a research note. The companies also may face challenges in China, where the two brewers hold top positions. AB InBev may have to sell SABMiller\u2019s 49 percent stake in CR Snow, a joint venture with China Resources Enterprise, according to\u00a0Sanford C. Bernstein analysts. Antitrust officials at the Chinese Ministry of Commerce will give the deal close scrutiny because the two companies have significant businesses there directly and through joint ventures, said David Anderson, a lawyer at Berwin Leighton Paisner in Brussels. \u201cMOFCOM will be a very important player in deciding this deal\u2019s fate,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe path to receiving merger clearance from Beijing for a deal like this one can be a long and uncertain one.\u201d In other countries, there\u2019s little overlap between the companies, according to analysts at Numis Securities Ltd.\u00a0 SABMiller is dominant in Africa, where AB InBev has no presence. In Europe, the combined company would be a much more effective competitor to Heineken NV and Carlsberg A\/S.

While SABMiller has so far   offers from its larger rival, a proposed union of the world\u2019s two biggest beermakers could create a behemoth with significant operations on every continent, allowing it to ride out slowing sales in any one market. Yet the company would remain vulnerable to competition from the tiny brewers that are winning over drinkers and contributing to that slowdown, at least in the U.S. Craft brewers, known for serving up flavorful offerings like hoppy IPAs and barrel-aged stouts, held about 19 percent of retail consumer beer sales in 2014, according to data from the Brewers Association. That\u2019s up from about 16 percent in 2013. By contrast, overall beer volume fell 1 percent in 2014, and the loss came mostly from macrobrewers, heavily reliant on milder, light lagers. An AB InBev-SABMiller tie-up doesn\u2019t offer a path to reverse that trend and may make it even worse, said Paul Gatza, director of the Brewers Association, a trade group for independent, craft brewers. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that larger standard lagers are just part of the global finance game and craft brewers are the ones who actually have a connection to customers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis deal makes us look more authentic. The larger breweries may have more muscle with retail and ad dollars, but consumers are still switching to craft.\u201d AB InBev and SABMiller have felt the pinch of that switch. MillerCoors, the U.S. joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Co., says its volume has declined by almost 10 million barrels since its inception seven years ago. The company said last month that it\u2019s closing its brewery in Eden, North Carolina, partly because of the volume lost due to \u201ceconomic challenges, an explosion of choice and fragmentation within the beer business, and a dramatic change in the way consumers engage with brands.\" AB InBev said in July that second-quarter sales to retailers fell 2.2 percent. The company\u2019s U.S. market share also declined as Bud and Bud Light sales fell by low single digits. \u201cWe can still do something that Anheuser-Busch can\u2019t: double in size,\u201d said Gary Fish, president and owner of\u00a0Deschutes Brewery in Bend, Oregon. \u201cCraft can still grow.\u201d Craft brewers\u2019 rapid gains have led the big producers to snap up some of their smaller rivals. Since 2011, AB InBev has purchased Goose Island Brewing in Chicago; Blue Point Brewing in Patchogue, New York; 10 Barrel Brewing in Bend, Oregon; Elysian Brewing in Seattle; and most recently Virtue Cider in Fennville, Michigan. Just last month, MillerCoors   San Diego\u2019s Saint Archer Brewing Co., Heineken NV purchased a 50 percent stake in Lagunitas Brewing Co., and AB InBev said it would buy Los Angeles-based Golden Road Brewing. \u201cThis is the strategy of the big breweries: If they just confuse things enough, then people might just turn away from craft entirely and say it\u2019s too confusing,\u201d said Dan Kenary, co-founder and chief executive officer of Harpoon Brewery in Boston. So far, Big Beer\u2019s attempts at developing its own craft products, such as AB InBev\u2019s Shock Top Belgian White and MillerCoors\u2019 Blue Moon, have mostly failed to win over hardcore craft-beer drinkers. About 61 percent of consumers said independent brewing is at least somewhat important when choosing a craft beer, according to a Brewers Association-commissioned Nielsen Omnibus Panel in 2014. \u201cThere certainly is a wonderful subset of consumers that really do care -- they care about authenticity, they care about where their beer is brewed, who\u2019s brewing it, what the ethics are of the company,\u201d said Kenary, whose\u00a0company is in its 30th year of operation and recently became employee-owned. Many craft brewers shun the corporate image, and some have even poked fun at the potential beer megamerger. Chicago\u2019s Metropolitan Brewery responded to news that AB InBev and SABMiller were discussing a deal last month by tweeting \u201cAB InBev looking at SABMiller now, hmm?\u201d and linking to a video of the Imperial March from Star Wars. Greg Hall, who was brewmaster at Goose Island for more than two decades before founding Virtue Cider, had more sympathy for the big brewers. Goose Island and Virtue both are now owned by AB InBev. \u201cThere are a lot of my peers in the craft-beer world who may not be the biggest fans of their beers, but you\u2019ve got to admire them as businesspeople,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThey make what most drinkers still drink, and the drinkers who don\u2019t drink their stuff, well, they\u2019re trying to make beer for them too.\u201d","timestamp":1444248000.0,"participant_ids":["ABI:BB","SAB:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-07\/ab-inbev-s-merger-plans-still-leave-big-beer-vulnerable-to-craft","subject":"A Merger Won't Solve Big Beer's Craft Problem"},{"body":"SABMiller Plc shares traded 10 percent below the price Anheuser-Busch InBev NV agreed to pay for the beermaker, a bigger discount than often seen in takeovers, because the deal faces months of scrutiny by antitrust regulators around the world that may yet derail the transaction. Typically, when a deal is expected to sail through to completion, the shares of a target trade just below the offer. In this case, many traders who speculate on the outcome of merger agreements are shunning the deal because it will take too long for the transaction to close, and there are better opportunities in other takeovers, said Jean-Francois Comte, co-manager of the $144 million Lutetia Patrimoine arbitrage fund in Paris. The tie-up between the two companies will be reviewed by competition authorities in the U.S. and China, where SABMiller operates joint ventures with local partners. The combined entity will control about 50 percent of global beer profits and sell one third of the world\u2019s brew. AB InBev will need to sell more than $16 billion of assets to win approval, said Wim Hoste of KBC Securities. SABMiller raised antitrust concerns in spurning AB InBev\u2019s earlier offers, prompting the would-be acquirer to agree to pay the target $3 billion if regulators block the deal. \u201cThere is a residual but misplaced fear the deal won\u2019t happen,\u201d said Andrew Holland, an analyst at Societe Generale. \u201cGiven the size of the break fee, there is a huge onus on AB InBev to make this deal happen.\u201d SABMiller rose 9 percent to close at 39.48 pounds in London after the world\u2019s second-largest brewer said it would recommend AB InBev\u2019s cash offer of 44 pounds a share to stockholders. The companies have an agreement in principle, and under U.K. takeover rules they have until Oct. 28 to forge a formal deal. Usually the discount in a target\u2019s share price narrows to about 1 percent by the end of trading in the day a friendly bid is announced, said Christopher Kummer, head of the Vienna-based Institute of Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances.  For bigger deals, the spread is often wider. On the day Royal Dutch Shell Plc agreed to buy BG Group Plc in April for about $70 billion, the target finished the day at a 10 percent discount to the value of the bid.

Analysts anticipate that Molson Coors Brewing Co., SABMiller\u2019s joint venture partner in the U.S., will buy SABMiller\u2019s stake in MillerCoors. Shares in Molson Coors jumped 10 percent to $86.82 at 12:05 p.m. in New York trading, bringing their advance to 26 percent in the five weeks since AB InBev confirmed its intention to acquire SABMiller.

Often when a deal is announced, long-term shareholders who don\u2019t want to wait for it to close sell at a slight discount to the takeover price. The buyers often are arbitragers, who try to capture the spread between the price they paid and the price the acquirer will pay at closing. \u201cIn a deal of this scale, arbitrage buyers probably do not have the firepower to tighten the discount,\u201d said Richard Marwood, who oversees about 10 billion pounds at Axa Investment Managers, including SABMiller stock.","timestamp":1444721180.0,"participant_ids":["SAB:LN","ABI:BB"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-13\/sabmiller-trades-below-ab-inbev-bid-as-arbitragers-see-risk","subject":"SABMiller Trades Below Bid Price as Regulatory Hurdles Loom"},{"body":"Molson Coors Brewing Co. is close to announcing an agreement to purchase SABMiller Plc\u2019s portion of their MillerCoors joint venture for about $12 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Molson Coors would buy SABMiller\u2019s 58 percent stake, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the agreement isn\u2019t yet public. The move would give the company full ownership of the venture, which sells Miller and Coors Light in the U.S. Molson Coors also would gain the rights to sell Miller beer overseas, according to the person. The widely expected deal would lift a major obstacle for Anheuser-Busch InBev NV to acquire SABMiller in a proposed $106 billion takeover. That deal, the brewing industry\u2019s biggest merger ever, has raised concerns about how it will affect competition in the U.S. By offloading the MillerCoors business, AB InBev and SABMiller are more likely to get regulatory approval for their deal. The MillerCoors sale, which is contingent on the other transaction going forward,\u00a0is slated to be announced on Wednesday, according to the person familiar with the deliberations. SABMiller declined to comment. AB InBev, the maker of Budweiser and Goose Island beers, has a 45 percent share of the U.S. market, while MillerCoors has 27 percent. For Molson Coors, owning all of the venture would boost its earnings per share by about 20 percent, according to an estimate by Ian Shackleton, an analyst at Nomura Securities. Trevor Stirling, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, had estimated that SABMiller\u2019s MillerCoors stake was worth $12.2 billion.\u00a0Nomura\u2019s Shackleton put it at $10.7 billion.

In a\u00a0$12 billion side deal devised to help the mega-merger clear antitrust hurdles, Molson Coors Brewing Co. plans to buy the Miller brand globally and purchase the other 58 percent of the MillerCoors U.S. joint venture. The takeover would more than double Molson Coors\u2019 revenue, which was $4.15 billion last year, and add $1 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. \u201cThe acquisition of the Miller brands globally gives us significant incremental scale in that business, takes us into a number of new markets and also strengthens our positions in a number of existing markets,\u201d Molson Coors Chief Executive Officer Mark Hunter said in a phone interview. The deal is dependent on regulatory approvals and the successful completion of AB InBev\u2019s $107 billion acquisition of SABMiller, which moved a step forward with a formal offer on Wednesday. Shares of Molson Coors, which is run from Denver and Montreal, rose 4.4 percent to $92.19 at the close in New York. The stock has now advanced 24 percent this year, with much of the gain coming on speculation of a deal similar to the one announced Wednesday. While analysts had speculated Molson Coors would buy out of the rest of the MillerCoors venture, the acquisition of the Miller brand globally wasn\u2019t as widely expected. The move plays into Molson Coors\u2019 strategy of international expansion by adding another recognizable American brand to take abroad, Hunter said. Molson Coors boosted international sales\u00a0volume 21 percent in the first nine months of 2015. The company is focusing on international expansion in Central and South America and will also look to expand volume in Europe, Australia, India and parts of Africa, Hunter said. Molson Coors said it will fund the Miller transaction with cash on hand and by issuing new debt and equity. The company is being advised by Kirkland & Ellis, Cleary Gottlieb and UBS AG. Even with the sale of SABMiller\u2019s stake of MillerCoors to Molson, the U.S. Congress and the\u00a0Justice Department should closely examine the impact of AB InBev\u2019s buyout of SABMiller on the domestic beer industry, said Bob Pease, chief executive officer of the Brewers Association, a trade group for independent craft brewers.\u00a0 Harmful consequences could include a lack of competition among beer distributors and undue influence over the commodities used in brewing all over the world, he said. \u201cOver time, AB InBev will have significant new global revenues to invest in the United States if it chooses to do so as a result of this acquisition,\u201d Pease said. \u201cAll of these issues -- and their potential effect on small brewers, the broader industry and U.S. beer drinkers -- must be carefully weighed and scrutinized by antitrust authorities.\u201d","timestamp":1447249652.0,"participant_ids":["TAP:US","ABI:BB","SAB:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-11\/molson-coors-set-to-double-sales-with-12-billion-sabmiller-deal","subject":"Molson Coors Set to Double Sales With $12 Billion Beer Deal"},{"body":"U.S. stocks slipped in quiet trading during the Veterans Day holiday, with merger news and a selloff in retail shares sparked by results from Macy\u2019s Inc. capturing the spotlight.

Companies including Haier Electronics Group Co. are weighing offers for the century-old unit, which may fetch more than the $3.3 billion Electrolux had agreed to pay, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. GE\u2019s accelerated timeline supports Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt\u2019s effort to reshape the company around industrial-manufacturing operations. He\u2019s selling the consumer-appliances business along with the bulk of GE\u2019s lending arm while expanding divisions making products such as gas turbines, oilfield equipment and jet engines. Immelt said at an investor meeting this week that GE has seen \u201csignificant inbound interest\u2019\u2019 in the appliances unit and that he expects to reach a deal early next year. Bidders could include manufacturers and financial firms, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said. A GE representative declined to comment. A representative for Haier\u2019s U.S. operations also declined to comment. GE restarted the sale process last week after backing out of the agreement with Sweden\u2019s Electrolux on Dec. 7, more than a year after it was first announced. The U.S. Justice Department contested the deal over concerns it would leave the market for range sales in the U.S. too heavily concentrated in the hands of Electrolux and Whirlpool Corp. Electrolux, which went to court last month to fight the Justice Department\u2019s challenge, agreed to pay GE a breakup fee of $175 million after the deal fell apart. Haier has weighed acquisitions as the Chinese company looks to expand its reach. The maker of televisions, washing machines and refrigerators has been looking to expand its e-commerce business and broaden its offerings of connected-home products. This is at least GE\u2019s third attempt to unload the business, which introduced an electric toaster in 1905 and a home electric washing machine in 1930. The company said in 2008 it would explore options to sell or spin off the business over concerns it was too heavily tied to the tumultuous U.S. market, but the effort was stymied by the financial crisis. A sale would leave GE\u2019s light-bulb division as the company\u2019s only remaining consumer business. Last year, the appliances and lighting unit generated $8.4 billion in sales, accounting for about 5.5 percent of GE\u2019s total revenue.

The insurers\u2019 annual operating results are \u201cnot material\u201d to the bank and the transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said. Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by market value, has focused on boosting commercial-lending and wealth-management units, while paring some insurance operations. The lender has been adding   from Credit Suisse Group AG and agreed this year to acquire most of General Electric Co.\u2019s railcar- and locomotive-leasing unit. Insurer AmTrust Financial Services Inc. reached a deal in May to buy a Wells Fargo business that provides vehicle service contracts. \u201cThe sale of our long-standing crop insurance business allows us to focus on and strengthen our distribution businesses, which account for approximately two-thirds of our insurance revenue,\u201d Laura Schupbach, head of Wells Fargo Insurance, said in the statement.

Zurich had about $3 billion of excess cash on its books after it abandoned its   of RSA Insurance Group Plc in September. The company has said the capital will be invested in the business or returned to shareholders by the end of 2016. Switzerland\u2019s biggest insurer is searching for a CEO after Martin Senn resigned Dec. 1 and Chairman Tom de Swaan was named as interim chief. \u201cThere is no reason to wait for deploying the capital,\u201d said Zurich Insurance spokesman Pavel Osipyants. \u201cThe decision to deploy the capital was made earlier.\u201d Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by market value, said in August that it was looking into \u201cstrategic options\u201d for the insurance unit.

Blockchain is the software that makes bitcoin possible, providing an immutable and transparent means of recording each time the digital currency is transferred from one person to another. The world of finance has taken notice, with a gold rush of startups saying their blockchain-related technologies can process virtually any kind of trade or money transfer in minutes instead of current times measured in days. \u201cAs with any early-stage, highly-complex technology that demonstrates the ability to change the way we live our lives and conduct business, blockchain demands a cross-industry, open source collaboration to advance the technology for all,\u201d Jim Zemlin, executive director at the Linux Foundation, said in the statement. Other participants include major parts of the financial system\u2019s infrastructure: Swift, the network that banks around the world use to notify each other of financial transactions, and CLS, the largest cash-settlement system in the $5.3 trillion currency market.

R3 is studying how trading of securities, derivatives and loans can be overhauled by using distributed ledger and blockchain technology. R3 and JPMorgan have also committed to contributing to the Hyperledger project, according to the statement. With a digital ledger, as long as banks or exchanges, all of whom are known to each other, verify that one company has the funds or assets to transact with another company, the settlement and clearing time is reduced to seconds. Fundamental to that prospect, however, is that various digital ledger applications can connect and communicate with each other. That\u2019s the aim of the new consortium, according to Zemlin. \u201cDistributed ledger systems today are being built in a variety of industries but to realize the promise of this emerging technology, an open source and collaborative development strategy that supports multiple players in multiple industries is required,\u201d he said in the statement. The best-known blockchain is the one that powers bitcoin. While it relies on anonymous users to verify and maintain its history of every bitcoin transaction, banks and financial institutions are exploring the technology to see if it can allow known users to interact.

The trials give customers a limit of 300 gigabits per month, then offer increments of 50 gigabits more for $10 each. The company says the approach, which is similar to what is used by wireless companies, is aimed at a small percentage of its heaviest Internet users whose streaming videos and other Web activity take up a large amount of its broadband network. AT&T offers a sponsored data option allowing companies to pay customers\u2019 wireless data charges while watching videos or viewing content on their phones and tablets.

The company is still doing a due diligence process before making a formal offer for RSA, they said. The financing is a bridge facility, meaning Zurich would need to repay it probably by selling securities if the bid goes ahead, according to the people. Zurich last month made a takeover proposal that would value RSA at about 5.6 billion pounds. That would make it the biggest acquisition in the industry in Europe this year. RSA is still trading below Zurich\u2019s tentative offer of 550 pence a share, signaling investors may be concerned about the deal closing at that price.

LightSquared, mired in legal and regulatory limbo since its 2012 bankruptcy filing, agreed to dial down some of its emissions and forgo terrestrial use of the band closest to the GPS signal on \"downlink,\" or the transmission from satellite to ground station, the company said in a statement Tuesday. The pact marks the end of one of many disputes between LightSquared and GPS makers over how its spectrum interfered with their systems. \u201cWe are glad to finally find resolution to these important spectrum issues and are pleased to reach an end to the case against Deere,\u201d LightSquared Chief Executive Officer Doug Smith said in the statement. \u201cDeere looks forward to working with LightSquared and other spectrum users on the important dual goals of expanding mobile broadband networks while protecting GPS and other navigation technologies, both of which are critical to the nation\u2019s interests,\u201d Ken Golden, a spokesman, said in a statement. LightSquared sued Deere, Garmin International Inc., Trimble Navigation Ltd. and other participants in the global-positioning satellite industry in 2013, accusing them of misrepresenting how GPS and broadband technologies would interact. It said they led LightSquared down the wrong path as founder Philip Falcone and his Harbinger Capital Partners LLC poured resources into the company, according to court papers. The lawsuit wasn\u2019t resolved with other defendants, Smith said in a phone interview Tuesday. According to court papers filed Nov. 23, LightSquared intended to make a new settlement proposal to Garmin and asked that Garmin not disclose the proposal to other defendants in the case. LightSquared didn\u2019t provide a timeline for a launch. It will have to file the Deere agreement with the\u00a0Federal Communications Commission, which would start the clock ticking on a long public-comment process.\u00a0LightSquared would also need to strike pacts with the other GPS companies. The settlement comes on the heels of another major development this month, when the company announced that the FCC had approved its application for a change in control, allowing JPMorgan Chase & Co. and others to take over its airwaves. LightSquared\u2019s plan to actually operate, using its airwaves for a satellite and mobile-phone network, remains under consideration at the FCC without a deadline for action. LightSquared   for bankruptcy in 2012 after the regulator rejected a similar business plan, saying it would interfere with GPS technology. The company won approval of its plan to exit bankruptcy in March, after it resolved a dispute with its biggest creditor, Dish Network Corp. Chairman Charles Ergen.  The Chapter 11 plan as approved gave Centerbridge Capital Partners LP, Fortress Investment Group LLC and a unit of JPMorgan control of most of the company, Falcone\u2019s Harbinger getting a minority of the new equity. It called for Ergen to be repaid in full and in cash.\u00a0LightSquared emerged from bankruptcy on Dec. 7, according to papers filed in Manhattan bankruptcy court. As part of the agreement with Deere, LightSquared will commit to conditions on its use of spectrum in an application to the FCC, and Deere agrees not to object to its deployment of a network within certain spectrum bands, according to the statement.

That\u2019s the idea, anyway, after the government scrapped the last remaining controls.  The move, effective on Saturday, is a milestone for a commercial banking industry that didn\u2019t exist as recently as the early 1980s. At the same time, there are some large limits on that freedom and on the role of private enterprise. The central bank has been clear that it will intervene if competition for deposits gets out of hand, and the state remains the dominant owner of the banking system. The latest reform comes against a backdrop of rising bad loans and a slowing economy. The savings-and-loan crisis in the U.S. is among past examples of the   associated with removing deposit-rate controls.

Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. get $45 billion recapitalization; ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the other lenders in the big four, later also get capital injections. * 2006: ICBC completes what was then the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering, in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Today, it\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest bank by assets. * 2008: Credit growth explodes as China\u2019s government tells lenders to open the floodgates to counter the global financial crisis. * 2012: Banks allowed to pay interest on yuan deposits of as much as 1.1 times the benchmark deposit rate. Interest-rate controls, including a floor on lending rates that guaranteed banks\u2019 margins, later reduced in stages. Then-Premier Wen Jiabao says that the biggest state-owned banks make profits \u201ctoo easily\u201d and amount to a monopoly that must be broken up. * 2014: Government approves trial of privately-owned banks. * 2015: Bank assets stand at about $30 trillion, almost twice the amount in the U.S.\u00a0   introduced.

Returning GE to its industrial roots means unloading the bulk of the GE Capital lending arm and overcoming U.S. opposition to the divestiture of the home-appliances division, along with buying Alstom SA\u2019s energy business. GE\u2019s chief executive officer cleared one hurdle Tuesday when U.S. and European regulators signed off on that 8.5 billion-euro ($9.5 billion) acquisition. \u201cI love the way the company looks,\u201d Immelt said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis pivot we talked about has a couple pillars in it, and this is one of them, so we\u2019re thrilled to get it done. This is a key part to the overall strategy of the company.\u201d GE agreed last year to buy Alstom\u2019s gas-turbine operations -- and create joint ventures in the steam turbine, renewable energy and electrical-transmission businesses -- in a 12.4 billion-euro deal. The final purchase price, adjusting for remedies, joint ventures and changes in the deal structure, is expected to be about 8.5 billion euros, GE said. GE\u2019s pledge to sell assets to an Italian rival, Ansaldo Energia SpA, helped allay concerns that the plan would crimp competition in the power-generation market, the European Commission   Tuesday in a statement. The U.S. Justice Department signaled its approval minutes later. Those green lights moved Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE toward a predicted fourth-quarter closing on the deal. The stock rose 4 percent to $24.96 at the close in New York, the biggest gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. GE is fighting U.S. regulators on a different front after the Justice Department sued in July to block the $3.3 billion sale of the appliances unit to Electrolux AB. The government said consumers would be hurt by a sale that removes a major manufacturer from the market. A trial date is set for November. \u201cMy expectation is that this deal gets approved,\u201d Immelt said. \u201cSimilar deals in the appliance industry have been approved in the past.\u201d Succeeding with that divestiture would eliminate one of GE\u2019s last remaining consumer-facing businesses, letting it focus on industrial products such as jet engines, diesel locomotives and oilfield equipment. GE is also selling about $200 billion of GE Capital lending assets, shrinking a division that imperiled the parent company during the financial crisis. Immelt said the GE Capital sales, which include last month\u2019s $9 billion deal with Capital One Financial Corp. for the health-care finance division, are running ahead of schedule. Once targeted to finish in 2017, the GE Capital pullback is now projected to be completed next year.

Voting 7-2, the justices yesterday gave a reprieve to a Teva patent that will protect Copaxone from rivals until September. The majority told a lower court to reconsider a ruling invalidating the patent.  The ruling is a blow to Teva\u2019s prospective generic competitors -- Mylan Inc., which is teaming up with Natco Pharma Ltd., and Novartis AG\u2019s Sandoz, which is working with Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc.  The decision puts new limits on the power of the specialized federal appeals court that invalidated Teva\u2019s patent. Writing for the majority, Justice Stephen Breyer said the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit must accept the trial judge\u2019s reading of a disputed patent unless that interpretation is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d  A judge who has presided over the entire case will be more familiar with the scientific issues than \u201can appeals court judge who must read a written transcript or perhaps just those portions to which the parties have referred,\u201d Breyer wrote.  Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.  The Federal Circuit\u2019s longstanding practice had been to review patents without giving any weight to the trial judge\u2019s interpretation. Google Inc. and Intel Corp. were among the companies that urged the Supreme Court to back that approach and rule against Teva.  The generic-drug companies pointed to a 1996 Supreme Court decision that said it was for the judge, not the jury, to decide what a patent covered. The companies said the logical conclusion is that an appeals court should be able to take a fresh look at the trial judge\u2019s conclusions.  Teva argued that federal appeals courts generally are required to defer to the factual findings of trial judges, so long as they are reasonable.  The case is Teva v. Sandoz, 13-854.  Microsoft Corp., the world\u2019s largest software company, has received a patent on a technology aimed at making mobile phones less annoying to others in some settings such as movie theaters.  Patent 8,934,879, which was issued Jan. 13, covers what the Redmond, Washington-based company calls an \u201cinconspicuous mode for mobile devices.\u201d According to the patent, the invention would make the mobile device responsive to environmental conditions, such as the dimmed light in a theater.  This would switch the phone to a silent mode or dim its display so that a single notification, such as the time of day, could be seen on a darkened screen. Microsoft notes that today\u2019s ubiquity of the mobile telephone, and many users\u2019 tendency to use it in lieu of a wristwatch, can distract theater audiences..  Microsoft applied for this patent in March 2013.  For more patent news, click here.

The New Zealand company, which has used the Uber name since 2014, said it has hired a trademark specialist and that it intendeds to oppose the San Francisco car company\u2019s application for a New Zealand trademark, according to the newspaper.  Police in New Zealand are scrutinizing the car company in the wake of reports that an Auckland resident was kicked out of one of their vehicles, the Herald reported.  When the Internet service company filed an application for its own trademark six months ago, New Zealand trademark regulators told it the name was too similar to the car company\u2019s, according to the New Zealand Herald.  Social-media scrapbook site Pinterest Inc. won a court order for sanctions against Pintrips Inc., a travel planning website, and its counsel for failing to provide information about its investors as part of a trademark lawsuit.  San Francisco-based Pinterest filed a complaint in October 2013 alleging Pintrips was attempting to ride on the social-media company\u2019s fame by infringing its trademark.  Pintrips, a Sunnyvale, California-based company whose technology enables users to shop more efficiently for airline flights, had opposed Pinterest\u2019s request for details on its investors, arguing it could lose funding by revealing the information.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore in Oakland, California, ruled Jan. 12 that Pintrips and its law firm, New York\u2019s Kenyon & Kenyon LLP, must pay $9,075 in sanctions for failing to provide details about its investors. The company must pay the sanction by May 13.  Pinterest had accused Pintrips of setting up a \u201cpin\u201d button on its website that was confusingly similar to the San Francisco company\u2019s \u201cpin it\u201d website button. It also objected to an application the flight-tracking company filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2012 to register \u201cPintrips\u201d as a trademark, and said it filed the suit to prevent consumer confusion.  Pintrips countered that Pinterest was using the lawsuit to bully the company into giving up its right to use a \u201cgeneric common term that merely describes a core function of its service.\u201d  Westmore rejected Pinterest\u2019s request for $31,962.50 in sanctions, ruling the company\u2019s use of estimates \u201cunacceptable\u201d without actual billing records. The judge ruled in August that the information Pinterest sought may shed light on Pintrips\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d with regard to name choice.  The case is Pinterest Inc., v.

With an agreement Tuesday to sell $32 billion in GE Capital assets to Wells Fargo & Co., this year\u2019s divestitures now exceed $126 billion, GE said. The company will now try to unload about $60 billion of international assets, including large operations in France, Japan and Italy. \u201cThis is our largest transaction to date and a critical step in our efforts to reduce the size of GE Capital,\u201d Keith Sherin, the unit\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a statement announcing the Wells Fargo deal. \u201cGlobally, GE Capital expects to be substantially done with its exit strategy by the end of 2016.\u201d After years of lagging behind benchmark U.S. stock indexes, GE announced a plan in April to sell the bulk of its lending operations, a business once so large that it almost capsized the parent company during the financial crisis. By shedding most of GE Capital, as well as consumer units such as the appliances division, CEO Jeffrey Immelt has re-emphasized industrial products spanning jet engines, oilfield equipment and locomotives. The effort gained additional urgency after Nelson Peltz\u2019s activist investment firm Trian Fund Management LP disclosed a $2.5 billion stake in Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE this month. While supporting the pullback from GE Capital, Trian said it wants to see Immelt follow through on the plan and other efforts to boost margins. GE\u2019s only significant U.S. platform left to sell is a franchise finance business with about $5.5 billion of assets, Sherin said. After closing the U.S. deals and completing a split-off of the North American retail finance operations now known as Synchrony Financial, GE plans to apply to drop its U.S. government designation as a systemically important financial institution. \u201cThe SIFI de-designation is kind of the official capping of their challenged -- some might call precarious -- journey through the global recession and meltdown of GE Capital,\u201d said Nicholas Heymann, a William Blair & Co. analyst who upgraded GE to outperform from market perform this week. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal because it gives them a lot more flexibility with regard to what they might want to do.\u201d GE rose 0.4 percent to $28.21 at 10:40 a.m. in New York. The shares advanced 11 percent this year through Monday, beating the 4.8 percent decline for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Industrials Index. The Wells Fargo deal, projected to close in early 2016, includes GE Capital\u2019s commercial distribution finance, vendor finance and corporate finance units, as well as about 3,000 employees. Toronto-Dominion Bank also bid for the businesses, while KKR & Co. and Apollo Global Management LLC sought portions of the assets, people familiar with the matter  . Wells Fargo previously agreed to buy commercial real estate assets and GE\u2019s railcar-leasing division.

Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever. The pace of advancement in AI\u00a0is \"actually speeding up,\" said Jeff Dean, a senior fellow at Google.\u00a0To celebrate their achievements and plot the year ahead, Dean and\u00a0many\u00a0of the other top minds in AI are convening in Montreal this week at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference. It\u00a0started in 1987 and has become a must-attend event for many Silicon Valley\u00a0companies\u00a0in the last few\u00a0years, thanks to the explosion in AI. NIPS was\u00a0where Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg chose in 2013\u00a0to announce the company's\u00a0plans to form an AI laboratory and where a startup named DeepMind showed off an AI that could learn to play computer games before it was\u00a0acquired by Google. There should be plenty to discuss this week. The unprecedented advancements in AI research this year can be attributed to a confluence of nerdy factors. For one, cloud computing infrastructure is vastly more powerful and affordable, with the ability to process\u00a0complex information. There are also more plentiful datasets and\u00a0free or inexpensive\u00a0software development tools for researchers to work with. Thanks to this, a\u00a0crucial class of learning technology, known as neural networks, have gone from being prohibitively expensive to relatively cheap. That's led to rapid uptake by the tech industry's largest companies, including\u00a0Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. Each operates its\u00a0own AI lab that conducts important research in the field and publishes much of it for the academic community to build upon. This year,\u00a0Google researchers nabbed the cover of scientific journal  \u00a0with\u00a0a system that can learn to   without directions. Facebook built a way to let computers\u00a0describe images to blind people;\u00a0Microsoft showed off a new Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another;\u00a0and IBM singled out AI as one of its greatest potential growth areas. Startups are also contributing\u00a0meaningfully to AI. Preferred Networks\u00a0is   that will\u00a0go into industrial robots made by Japan's\u00a0Fanuc, and Indico Data Labs worked with a Facebook researcher to teach a computer   using its own sort of\u00a0imagination. For a look at how far computer intelligence has come this year, here are\u00a0six\u00a0charts that should give you a clearer picture. Computers have become a lot better at figuring out what's in a photo.\u00a0In 2012, a team of University of Toronto researchers won the world's top image-recognition competition. The entire team was eventually recruited by\u00a0Google, and its\u00a0approach was quickly adopted by the company and its peers. In 2015, AI systems based on the project's approach, which relies on a technique called deep learning, have become\u00a0much more accurate. In tests, error rates are down to less than\u00a05\u00a0percent, making them better than\u00a0some\u00a0humans' performances. Lots of companies are embracing AI, perhaps none more than Google. The Internet giant went from\u00a0sporadic usage of deep learning in 2012 to applying it to\u00a0thousands of projects\u00a0this year. Startups are adopting AI in big ways, too.\u00a0CrowdFlower, which supplies structured\u00a0data to companies,\u00a0said\u00a0it has seen a dramatic uptick in the amount of data being requested by businesses\u00a0to help them conduct AI research. DiffBot, another startup,\u00a0is using AI to improve its automated data-scraping tools. A main focus of AI research is in\u00a0teaching computers to think for themselves and improvise\u00a0solutions to common problems. One way to do that is to give them a slimmed-down version of the real world, such as\u00a0the simplified environments presented in video games, then ask them to explore it and record the results. (Check out the chart above for a look at how far Google's Atari project has come since 2013.) But the potential\u00a0goes beyond games: Similar software could be used to teach things to AI computers and help them more quickly learn such new things as medical diagnostics, environmental science, or improved personal recommendations. Google's Dean likens recent advancements\u00a0in AI\u00a0capabilities to evolution. \"We're at this point in actual evolution where, previously, animals didn't have eyes, and now they have eyes,\" he said. \"That's going to change a lot of stuff.\u00a0Computers used to not be able to see very well, and now they're starting to open their eyes.\"","timestamp":1449572411.0,"participant_ids":["GOOGL:US","FB:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-08\/why-2015-was-a-breakthrough-year-in-artificial-intelligence","subject":"Why 2015 Was a Breakthrough Year in Artificial Intelligence"},{"body":" Nokia Oyj agreed to buy Alcatel-Lucent SA in an all-stock transaction valued at 15.6 billion euros ($16.6 billion) to create the biggest maker of equipment that underpins mobile-phone networks. Nokia\u2019s biggest acquisition would result in a supplier that surpasses Ericsson AB and Huawei Technologies Co. in wireless-infrastructure revenue. Nokia Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri, who will run the enlarged company, will bolster its position in China, a market of 1.3 billion mobile subscribers, and take on contracts with the two biggest U.S. carriers -- Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. The next challenge for Nokia is to convince Alcatel investors, regulators and trade unions the deal will make the company stronger without leading to a network provider that is too dominant. Each company has sold units and slashed tens of thousands of jobs in recent years as carriers curbed spending. \u201cThis is not a combination starting on weakness,\u201d Suri said on a conference call. \u201cWe\u2019re both over our respective restructuring plans and we have momentum in the market.\u201d Alcatel investors will receive 0.55 Nokia share for each stock they own, the companies said Wednesday. The deal values Alcatel at 4.12 euros per share, 8 percent less than the most recent closing price. The stock fell 11 percent to 3.98 euros at 1:52 p.m. in Paris after soaring 16 percent on Tuesday. Nokia rose 1.2 percent to 7.58 euros in Helsinki. Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, also said it started a strategic review for its HERE maps business. Bids are expected soon for the unit, which is valued by Nokia at about 2 billion euros and has attracted interest from companies and private-equity firms, people familiar with the matter  . The takeover lets Nokia add products used to transmit landline and Internet traffic, giving it a more complete offering to sell to carriers as the amount of data traveling on networks increases with the popularity of Netflix and other video and music services. Devices from   are also getting connected to wireless networks. \u201cWe knew we were the best in mobile broadband, but we lacked the rest,\u201d Nokia Chairman Risto Siilasmaa said on the call. \u201cWe examined all options over many months, but Alcatel-Lucent was a unique opportunity.\u201d The combined company will be called Nokia and Siilasmaa will continue in his position. Alcatel CEO Michel Combes is leaving the company and will remain a shareholder. Alcatel shareholders will own 33.5 percent of the company and Nokia investors the remainder. If completed, the deal will be the industry\u2019s biggest since at least 1999, when Lucent Technologies Inc. bought Ascend Communications Inc. for about $21 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It would also be comparable to the transaction that created today\u2019s Alcatel: the French company\u2019s purchase of Lucent in 2006 for  , according to Bloomberg data. The deal would top Nokia\u2019s record acquisition of map provider Navteq Corp. for about $8 billion in 2008, and the biggest by a Finnish company. Nokia and Alcatel have more than 110,000 workers combined. Suri, who took over as head of Nokia\u2019s networks unit in 2009 and became group CEO last year, has revived the equipment business by cutting more than 25,000 jobs over three years and focusing on more lucrative contracts. He said the takeover will result in \u201csome impact on headcount.\u201d While France\u2019s government doesn\u2019t own a significant stake in Alcatel -- one of its investment arms holds 3.25 percent according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- it is concerned about what will happen to the approximately 7,000 people who work for the company in the country. Suri is in Paris this week to negotiate those details and his itinerary included a meeting with President Francois Hollande. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday the government will closely monitor any consequences the deal may have on jobs, and will seek to make sure the transaction helps build a viable European champion. \u201cThe discussion with the French government was easy,\u201d Combes said in an interview. \u201cWe said we\u2019d keep the same number of factories in France because we have the right size, but we will be transfering staff to R&D,\u201d which is \u201csomething that was needed by Nokia.\u201d The companies expect to complete the deal in the first half of 2016. They are seeking savings of 900 million euros a year, to be achieved in 2019. They also expect about 200 million euros of reductions in interest expenses a year starting in 2017. The companies\u2019 combined sales last year were about 26 billion euros. Nokia said it will look at divestment opportunities after the takeover. Alcatel\u2019s submarine-cable business, which the company   last year, is set to become an independent entity, Combes said. Alcatel lost billions of dollars in the years following its 2006 merger with Lucent as it struggled to revive sales. \u201cTwo years ago, Alcatel-Lucent was almost bankrupt with only some intellectual property rights buying it some bank financing,\u201d Macron said. Still, Alcatel shares have more than tripled since Combes became CEO in 2013 as he cut costs and landed contracts from new customers. Combes has less than eight months left of his three-year turnaround plan, aimed at making Alcatel profitable. Sweden\u2019s Ericsson is now the largest maker of wireless-network gear -- which includes equipment such as base stations and antennas that transmit calls and data -- with a market share of 25.7 percent in 2014, according to IDC. Huawei had 23.2 percent, Nokia 15.8 percent and Alcatel 11.4 percent share. Founded as a wood-pulp mill in 1865, Nokia\u2019s transformations have included switches from rubber boots and toilet paper to cables, televisions, computers and mobile phones. It was the world\u2019s largest handset maker -- with a market value reaching 300 billion euros -- before Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. claimed its leadership. Nokia shares have more than doubled since the company agreed to sell its mobile-phone business to Microsoft Corp. in 2013 for about $7.5 billion. That deal left Nokia with net cash of about 5 billion euros at the end of last year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised Nokia, and Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as its legal adviser.

It may be \u201cgood news\u201d for the AT&T deal that Netflix and Cogent are asking for conditions, said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson who expects the deal to close. \u201cThe broad consensus is that Netflix played a central role in scuttling the Comcast deal,\u201d Moffett said.

Before an unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor of New York state last year, Wu worked as an unpaid Google fellow in 2008 and served as a senior advisor to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in 2011 and 2012, helping draft Internet traffic regulation that Google favors. Wu coined the term \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d and a   credited him with partly inspiring Google's open mobile strategy in Android. The  , which was presented at the Antitrust Enforcement Symposium in Oxford, U.K., over the weekend, says the content Google displays at the top of many search results pages is inferior to material on competing websites. For this reason, the paper asserts, the practice has the effect of harming consumers. Wu co-authored the study with Michael Luca, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, and data scientists at the local reviews site Yelp, which has been one of Google's primary opponents in the global antitrust fight.\u00a0Wu was paid by Yelp for his work\u00a0on the paper. The research\u00a0seeks to undermine Google's primary defense against the charges filed in Europe, where competition regulators have formally established a  . Google says it has created a   by bundling its own answers at the top of search results to questions like \u201cWhat time is it in London?\u201d or \u201cWhat's the weather in Berlin?\u201d The paper acknowledges that in many cases, Google's answers to such questions are handy for users. But when the query is subjective\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s the best pediatrician in San Francisco?\u201d\u2014Google points to its own results first, which, Wu and his colleagues allege, hurts consumers. To demonstrate the point, data scientists at Yelp ran a series of blind A\/B tests, showing 2,690 Internet users two sets of search results in response to queries about local businesses. One half got the typical Google results: On the top of the page, there were seven links that pointed to Google's own content (usually listings on the social network Google Plus.) The other half were shown pages modified by an Internet plug-in, which replaced the original results with external listings that the Google algorithm itself had organically selected as the most relevant. According to Yelp's findings, users were 45 percent more likely to click on the merit-based search results. \u201cGoogle appears to be strategically deploying universal search in a way that degrades the product so as to slow and exclude challengers to its dominant search paradigm,\u201d the paper concludes. Wu says the findings were a \u201cgame changer\u201d for him and convinced him of Google\u2019s wrongdoing. \u201cIt's a legal exercise of monopoly if it hurts competitors while helping consumers, but if it hurts consumers while also hurting competitors, then there is no justification for the conduct,\u201d he says. Google declined to comment publicly on the paper. But two people familiar with the company\u2019s thinking criticized the paper for assuming that more clicks equates to better search results. For example, users searching for \u201cthe best pediatrician in Brooklyn\u201d may be more satisfied by Google\u2019s list of doctors with accompanying phone numbers than with links to other websites that they then have to click on and wait for as each one loads. These people also note that Yelp listings are often prominently displayed on the first page of search results and that Yelp\u2019s business does not appear to have suffered by Google privileging its own material. Yelp\u2019s stock is up nearly threefold since it went public in 2012. Consumers could also turn to competing search engines like Bing, go directly to sites like Yelp or open an app on their smartphone. Wu doesn\u2019t think that exonerates Google. \u201cGiven that general Google search faces limited and in some countries no direct competition, I think it can get away with weakening or degrading the product, and suffer little consequence,\u201d he says. \u201cIn fact, in antitrust cases, the ability to do things that effectively eliminate consumer welfare like offering a degraded search can be evidence of market or monopoly power.\u201d\u00a0 Wu describes the research as a \u201crighteous cause.\u201d He says, \u201cI have great respect and admiration for Google as a company, and feel that 90 percent of what they do makes life easier or better. In this case, I am convinced that Yelp's data is showing a deviation from those principles, and I agreed to write the paper to make that point known to the world.\u201d","timestamp":1435550403.0,"participant_ids":["GOOGL:US","YELP:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-29\/high-profile-study-turns-up-the-antitrust-heat-on-google","subject":"High-Profile Study Turns Up the Antitrust Heat on Google"},{"body":"Apache Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp., two exploration businesses that may find themselves as targets in an industry consolidation, are run by chief executives with smaller golden parachutes than similar-sized oil and gas companies. The dollar incentive for takeovers for Apache CEO John Christmann was $8.4 million\u00a0as of the company\u2019s fiscal year-end when he was chief operating officer, and Anadarko CEO Al Walker\u2019s was $31.2 million as of the end of 2014, regulatory filings show. By comparison, Charif Souki, the CEO of natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy Inc., has a payout of $147.8 million, the highest of\u00a083 U.S. oil and gas companies with a market value less than $45 billion as of their fiscal year-end. Industry giants such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp. -- among a group of oil producers that has a   in cash and shares to fund takeovers -- are bargain hunting for smaller firms battered by the commodity\u2019s slump. U.S. oil prices are down 45 percent in the past year, the worst 12-month slide since 1986, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Anadarko, based in The Woodlands, Texas, and the third-largest U.S. natural gas producer, said it   an all-stock offer for Apache after the Houston-based company refused to engage in substantive talks. The move has put both businesses into play as targets,\u00a0John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, said in an interview last week. By making the unsuccessful bid public, Anadarko may be trying to increase pressure on Apache\u2019s board to consider a sale. Among those companies with the smallest golden parachute for its CEO is SM Energy Co. The payout for Javan Ottoson would be $1.26 million as of Dec. 31, 2014, when he was chief operating officer, according to its proxy filing. \u201cParticularly in view of the propensity for mergers, acquisitions and consolidations in our industry, we believe that these change of control executive severance agreements promote stability and continuity among our executives,\u201d Denver-based SM Energy wrote in its   filed in April. The payment would allow executives \u201cto remain neutral in the face of a transaction that would benefit our stockholders, but would result in their involuntary termination,\u201d the company wrote. Activist investor Carl Icahn has built a 13 percent stake in Cheniere, according to a November regulatory filing. He\u2019s previously forced the sale of companies that he owns. Spokesmen for Anadarko, Apache and Cheniere declined to comment beyond the filings. CEO\u2019s typically receive a golden parachute if they\u2019re terminated without cause, or resign after a demotion following a takeover. The average payout among the 83 oil and gas companies averages 0.6 percent of the company\u2019s market capitalization, according the data compiled by Bloomberg. The average golden parachute payment was $13.8 million, and the median was $8.4 million. The biggest parachute relative to company size is the $36.2 million that would be due to John Schiller Jr., the CEO of Energy XXI Ltd. His award was equal to about 15 percent of the company\u2019s $249 million market capitalization at its June 30 fiscal year-end. The Houston-based business\u2019 stock has tumbled 74 percent in the past year and its bonds are trading for about 15 cents on the dollar.

Nokia has reached out to potential buyers including Uber Technologies Inc., the mobile car-booking application, and private-equity firms, the people said. A group of German carmakers has also shown interest, the people said, and bids for the unit are expected as soon as this month. The maps business, which is known as HERE, is valued at about 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion), according to Nokia\u2019s financial reports. That suggests Nokia\u2019s mapping assets have lost value since 2008, when the company   $8.1 billion to buy map provider Navteq Corp. Shares rose 5.6 percent to 7.58 euros in Helsinki, the highest close since 2011, valuing the entire company at about 28 billion euros. The Finnish company, which is working with a financial adviser, may decide against a sale if it can\u2019t get a price it deems sufficient, the people said. HERE reported full-year sales of 970 million euros and an operating loss of 1.24 billion euros, including a goodwill impairment of 1.21 billion euros, according to the annual report. In January, Nokia projected rising sales for its maps and patents divisions for 2015. Proceeds from a sale of HERE could be used for acquisitions to build Nokia\u2019s network business, including the long-mooted takeover of part of French rival Alcatel-Lucent SA, according to Sebastien Sztabowicz, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Paris. \u201cWe believe a sale of the mapping business could give further credibility to the scenario of an offer on Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s wireless access business,\u201d Sztabowicz wrote in a note to clients. Alcatel shares closed up 4.8 percent at 3.83 euros, valuing the Paris-based company at about 10.8 billion euros. Nokia Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri is seeking to reduce the company\u2019s debt and boost its rating from junk status. The company\u2019s map business provides data to Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Yahoo! Inc. and four out of five car-navigation systems. Representatives for Espoo, Finland-based Nokia and Uber declined to comment. Spokesmen for German carmakers Daimler AG and BMW AG also declined to comment, and a representative for Volkswagen AG didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Last year, Nokia named Sean Fernback to head the maps business. Fernback, who joined Nokia from Dutch navigation-device maker TomTom NV, replaced Michael Halbherr, who left the company after disagreeing over the unit\u2019s strategy with CEO Suri, people familiar with the matter said at the time. There was internal debate over whether the unit should focus on automotive and enterprise clients or also continue to target consumers, the people said. Nokia has three businesses left after it sold its phone-unit to Microsoft for about $7.5 billion: the networks division, which makes up about 90 percent of total revenue, its maps business, and a research and development unit which is responsible for licensing its patents.

French President Francois Hollande is meeting Nokia Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri and Alcatel CEO Michel Combes at the Elysee Palace on Tuesday, after the companies said the negotiations may lead to a takeover offer for Paris-based Alcatel. There is no certainty a deal can be reached. Alcatel shares jumped as much as 18 percent as Nokia slid. The combined entity would become the biggest maker of wireless-network equipment, surpassing Sweden\u2019s Ericsson AB and Huawei Technologies Co. of China, according to researcher IDC. The deal would let Nokia bolster its position in China, a market with about 1.3 billion mobile subscribers, and take on some contracts with the two biggest U.S. carriers -- Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. \u201cIt\u2019s a real game changer,\u201d said Sami Sarkamies, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Helsinki. \u201cThey have a lot of work ahead, but Suri has a good background for this.\u201d Shares of Nokia lost 4.1 percent to 7.46 euros at 5:23 p.m. in Helsinki, after dropping as low as 7.13 euros. A takeover will probably dilute Nokia\u2019s profit margins at its wireless business, according to Bloomberg analysts John Butler and Matthew Kanterman. Alcatel advanced 15 percent to 4.44 euros in Paris, after rising as high as 4.57 euros. Nokia and Alcatel have more than 110,000 workers combined. Suri, who took over as head of Nokia\u2019s networks unit in 2009, has revived the business by cutting more than 25,000 jobs over the past three years and focusing on more lucrative contracts. Nokia executives are seeking support from the French state, which has previously tried to block corporate mergers at home. The government will pay attention to possible impact for jobs and operations at Alcatel\u2019s French sites, a spokeswoman for the Economy Ministry said by phone. Qiao Yuhua, a spokeswoman for Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell, declined to comment on how a deal would affect the Chinese network-equipment venture. The takeover would also let Nokia add products used for transmitting landline and Internet traffic, giving it a more complete offering to sell to carriers as the amount of data traveling on networks increases with the popularity of Netflix and other video and music services. In a response, Ericsson could seek to combine with Juniper Networks Inc., a maker of Internet routers with a market value of almost $10 billion, Nordea\u2019s Sarkamies said. A spokesman for Ericsson declined to comment. Ericsson is now the largest maker of wireless-network gear -- which includes equipment such as base stations and antennas that transmit mobile-phone calls and data -- with a market share of 25.7 percent in 2014, according to IDC. Huawei had 23.2 percent, Nokia 15.8 percent and Alcatel 11.4 percent share. Alexander Peterc, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said Alcatel could be worth 4.50 euros per share in a sale, which would value the company\u2019s equity at 12.7 billion euros ($13.5 billion). A planned disposal of Nokia\u2019s maps business has led analysts to speculate that the proceeds could be used to help pay for acquisitions. Bloomberg News   on Friday that Nokia is exploring a sale of the unit known as HERE. Nokia\u2019s purchase of Alcatel may be the biggest in the industry since at least 1999, when Lucent Technologies Inc. bought Ascend Communications Inc. for about $21 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Depending on the final terms of the deal, it would also be comparable to the transaction that created today\u2019s Alcatel: the French company\u2019s purchase of Lucent in 2006  , according to Bloomberg data. The deal would top Nokia\u2019s record acquisition of map provider Navteq Corp. for about $8 billion in 2008, and would be the biggest-ever by a Finnish company. Consolidation has dominated conversations in the network-equipment industry for at least the past five years, as price wars dragged profits down and carriers reduce spending on infrastructure amid sluggish revenue. Talks between Nokia and Alcatel have been on and off in the past. In 2013, Nokia   including a combination with Alcatel\u2019s mobile-phone networks unit. Alcatel shares have more than tripled since Combes became CEO in 2013 as he reduced costs and landed contracts from new customers. Combes has less than eight months left of his three-year turnaround plan, aimed at making Alcatel profitable and helping it generate cash. The company lost billions of dollars in the years following its deal with Lucent as its struggled to revive sales growth. At the time of the merger, the combined company had an aggregate market value of 30 billion euros. Founded as a wood-pulp mill in 1865, Nokia\u2019s transformations have included switches from rubber boots and toilet paper to cables, televisions, computers and mobile phones. It was the world\u2019s largest handset maker -- with a market value reaching 300 billion euros -- before Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. claimed its leadership. Nokia shares have more than doubled since the company   its mobile-phone business to Microsoft Corp. in 2013 for about $7.5 billion.

Such a deal would create an explorer that pumps more crude than OPEC member Ecuador. Apache rejected an initial proposal from its rival and is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise on its options, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.\u00a0It\u2019s unclear whether talks will resume, other bidders may emerge, or Anadarko will walk away, the people said. In pursuing Apache, Anadarko would acquire a portfolio of fields that contain a higher proportion of crude than its own. Apache is one of the biggest leaseholders in the Permian Basin in western Texas, the largest U.S. shale play and the only one where oil output has continued to grow even as drillers slash spending and idle rigs. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good combination in my view, and the market agrees,\u201d Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, said Tuesday. \u201cIt could be a defensive move by Anadarko to ward off a potential takeover bid. Anadarko has been viewed as a potential target for years.\u201d Anadarko sank 6.6 percent, the most since January, to close at $63.42 Tuesday. Apache jumped 4.4 percent before giving back those gains and closing 1.2 percent lower at $53.31. Representatives for Anadarko and Apache declined to comment. \"We have a policy on not commenting on M&A, so no comments,\" Apache Chief Executive Officer John Christmann said Tuesday at a Hart Energy conference in Midland, Texas. Apache\u2019s output is more than 50 percent oil, compared with just 38 percent at Anadarko. A combined company would produce about 580,000 barrels of crude a day, compared with about 530,000 for Ecuador. Anadarko, which operates from Mozambique to Wyoming, has struggled to sustain reserves growth even as spending exploded. The company\u2019s exploration failure rate doubled last year; 14 percent of the wells Anadarko drilled in its search for untapped fields were dry holes, up from about 7 percent in 2013 and 4.7 percent in 2012. Growth in the company\u2019s oil and gas reserves slowed to 2.4 percent in 2014 from more than 9 percent in the prior year, despite four consecutive years of double-digit spending increases. During the third quarter of this year, Anadarko lost $817 million on dry holes, a seven-fold increase from a year earlier. Reserves are accumulations of crude and gas that have yet to pumped out of the ground. For investors, they are an important measure of an energy producer\u2019s ability to generate cash flow in the future. Though Apache\u2019s shares have been pummeled along with the rest of the industry as commodity prices stay depressed, Apache\u2019s market valuation still means only the biggest energy producers could consider an offer. That stood at more than $18 billion at the Friday close, before Bloomberg   that a potential buyer had sent the company a letter in the past few weeks about a takeover bid. Apache is unlikely to sell for less than $70 to $80 a share, Leo Mariani, an oil and gas analyst with RBC Capital Markets in Austin, wrote Tuesday in a research note. Apache last week reported a smaller-than-expected adjusted loss and boosted its 2015 production forecast. Its stock rose about 13 percent Monday, valuing it at more than $20 billion. Anadarko, whose shares have fallen almost 18 percent this year through Monday, has a market valuation of about $34.5 billion. Anadarko could use a deal with Apache to fend off potential predators.

Apache is one of the biggest leaseholders in the Permian Basin in western Texas, the only shale area where oil output has continued to grow even as drillers slash spending and idle rigs. \"Anadarko apparently offered a very small premium, which isn\u2019t going to endear the deal to Apache shareholders,\" Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, said by phone. \"If this is a good deal they should have offered more.\" By making the unsuccessful bid public, Anadarko may be trying to increase pressure on Apache\u2019s board to consider a sale. \u201cWhen you have a good balance sheet, why be in a rush to sell the company with oil prices in the low $40s?\u201d\u00a0Leo Mariani, an oil and gas analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said by phone from Austin. \u201cThis was a classic example of someone trying to take advantage of a weak stock price in the market and try to steal something on the cheap.\u201d Hostile deals for upstream companies are rare because much of the value is tied to untapped reserves of oil and gas, and most information about those reserves isn\u2019t public,\u00a0said Subash Chandra, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities in New York. \u201cApache has assets in multiple basins, domestic and international,\u201d Chandra said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you can go hostile. Without cooperation, there\u2019s not a way forward.\u201d In pursuing Apache, Anadarko would have acquired a portfolio of fields that contain a higher proportion of crude than its own. Apache\u2019s output is more than 50 percent oil, compared with just 38 percent at Anadarko. Anadarko, which operates from Mozambique to Wyoming, saw its exploration failure rate double last year; 14 percent of the wells the company drilled in its search for untapped fields were dry holes, up from about 7 percent in 2013 and 4.7 percent in 2012. Its shares have fallen 11 percent this week. \u201cWhen I think of really choice assets that are not easily replicable, I think of Anadarko,\u201d\u00a0Chandra said. \u201cAnadarko has a lot of long-lived, unbooked potential. Looking forward, that\u2019s what creates value, that\u2019s where you get the big premium.\u201d","timestamp":1447241713.0,"participant_ids":["APC:US","APA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-11\/anadarko-confirms-it-made-a-bid-to-acquire-apache","subject":"Anadarko Withdraws Offer to Buy Apache After Terms Were Rejected"},{"body":"The worst oil market in decades would be hard to spot in West Texas, where two-lane county roads are still jammed with trucks and energy companies are on the prowl for deals. The Permian Basin, the biggest of the shale-oil regions that ignited the U.S. energy boom, is also the only one where production is increasing even as drillers idle more than half the rigs in the country during the longest price slump since the 1980s. That\u2019s drawn the interest of companies from Exxon Mobil Corp. to   that have hunted for assets in the hot, arid flatland that spans an area the size of Syria. Anadarko\u2019s bid for Apache Corp. was seen driven by Apache\u2019s vast holdings in the Permian. Rising output from the region has helped buoy U.S. production after OPEC\u2019s decision to pump more oil to maintain market share sent crude prices into a tailspin. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing a lot of people that are targeting the Permian,\u201d Allen Gilmer, chief executive officer of Austin-based Drilling Info Inc., said in an interview in Houston. \u201cIf you were to look for the most stable area today to go do anything, it\u2019s got to be there. Today you might even argue it\u2019s more stable than Saudi Arabia.\u201d Exxon, the largest publicly traded energy company in the world, bought 48,000 acres in the Permian in two deals in August and is meeting with small, closely held producers to discuss additional purchases and joint ventures. Anadarko made an unsolicited, all-stock offer to purchase Apache, which has one of the largest Permian positions with 3.2 million acres, before withdrawing it, Anadarko CEO Al Walker said last week. Oil production in the Permian is forecast by the government to rise 0.6 percent in December to 2.02 million barrels a day, even as drillers have idled 59 percent of the rigs there in the past year. Output in rival shale fields like the Bakken and Eagle Ford has fallen 12% and 25%, respectively, as drillers pulled out after oil prices crashed last year. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude has declined about 45 percent over the past 12 months. On Monday the U.S. benchmark gained $1 to $41.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Permian\u2019s multiple layers of oil- and gas-soaked rocks, in some places stacked 5,000 feet thick, contain plenty of places to drill that will yield 30 percent to 40 percent rates of return with crude prices as low as $40 a barrel, Laird Dyer,\u00a0a Royal Dutch Shell Plc energy analyst, said at a conference in Toronto Nov. 10. A single layer in the Permian, the Spraberry, probably holds 75 billion barrels of recoverable oil, Dyer said. That\u2019s enough to supply the entire world for more than two years. \u201cSomebody described it to me once as a tiramisu, it\u2019s just lots of layers of beauty over there,\u201d\u00a0Drilling Info\u2019s Gilmer said. \u201cEveryone recognizes that the Permian Basin is by far the richest land on earth. The only thing holding it back from more and more is the engineering, and I think this is an industry that\u2019s really proven that the engineering gets better every year.\u201d The region seems to be the place where new companies continue to look to expand, he said. Roughly $50 billion in private-equity capital is funding more than 80 management teams focused on the Permian Basin, Will Giraud, chief commercial officer at Concho Resources Inc., told a crowd of 1,100 attendees on Nov. 10 at the Hart Energy Executive\u00a0Oil Conference in Midland, Texas. Concho has about 700,000 acres in the basin. \u201cIt\u2019s the last oil basin standing,\u201d Giraud said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s still the last place you can put together a material position. It\u2019s the last place you can drill in this environment and make money. It\u2019s the last place where there\u2019s still a tremendous amount of resources to be discovered.\u201d","timestamp":1447624860.0,"participant_ids":["APC:US","APA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-16\/oil-producers-hungry-for-deals-drool-over-west-texas-tiramisu-","subject":"Oil Producers Hungry for Deals Drool Over West Texas `Tiramisu'"},{"body":"Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Eni SpA agreed on a plan to develop adjoining natural-gas areas off Mozambique as the East African nation moves toward getting its first exports off the ground.

Named Twitter Inc.\u2019s interim chief executive officer on Thursday, Dorsey returns to a job he had until being pushed out in 2008 from the firm he helped create. Similarly, Jobs returned to Apple as interim CEO in 1997 after being forced out in 1985, and guided the company to create the iMac, iPhone and iPad. Dorsey, 38, demurred when asked during an interview whether he\u2019s interested in becoming Twitter\u2019s permanent CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s really up to the search committee and they\u2019re going to look at internal and external candidates,\u201d he said. His return signals that Twitter is looking for a leader who can inspire confidence in the company\u2019s product vision,  after a slew of leadership changes in the past five years, slower growth than anticipated and advertising efforts that have failed to gain traction. Dorsey\u2019s passion for Twitter, the social-media company which he helped start in 2006 with Evan Williams and Biz Stone, has been evident. Even while running Square Inc., a digital-payments company he co-founded in 2009, Dorsey has stayed active as Twitter\u2019s chairman, serving as adviser to outgoing CEO Dick Costolo, who took the top post in October 2010. The pair meet over dinners most weeks on Tuesdays at Zuni Caf\u00e9 near the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. Dorsey recommended that Twitter acquire Vine, the short-video sharing application, to complement Twitter\u2019s 140-character messages and helped oversee product development in 2011-2012 before leaving to focus on Square. The stock rose 1 percent to $36.21 at 11:16 a.m. in New York following the announcement about the leadership changes after the markets closed Thursday. \u201cI have a lot of context for what the company\u2019s doing around the product and the service, and I don\u2019t anticipate any changes in strategy or direction,\u201d Dorsey said in the interview. Dorsey tends to lead in terms of big ideas and grand visions. In operational meetings, he leans toward discussing philosophical positions on a product\u2019s purpose, as opposed to going through a checklist of action items. Dorsey\u2019s emulation of Jobs was highlighted in the book \u201cHatching Twitter\u201d by Nick Bilton about the company\u2019s beginnings. \u201cDorsey began casting himself in the image of Steve Jobs, calling himself an \u2018editor,\u2019 as Jobs referred to himself, and adopting a singular uniform: a white buttoned-up Dior shirt, blue jeans and a black blazer,\u201d Bilton wrote, according to a 2013   in the New York Times. Much of the story of Twitter\u2019s early days involves conflict among the founders. Dorsey\u2019s relationship with Williams grew so strained that Williams pushed him out of the CEO role. Dorsey kept his chairman title, but it was seen as ceremonial. \u201cAfter Dorsey lost his position as CEO, he felt that he had something to prove,\u201d according to a 2013 profile in the New Yorker magazine. \u201cAs some Silicon Valley skeptics saw it, Dorsey had lucked into one good idea, programmed some simple code, bumbled along as the company surged to success, then claimed more credit than was his due.\u201d Dorsey and Jim McKelvey set about to develop a portable credit-card reader. They created Square in 2009 and it quickly grew, with a funding round late last year valuing the company at $6 billion. Square now has more than 1,000 employees, Aaron Zamost, a spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail. Starbucks Corp.   $25 million in the payments provider in 2012 and began using Square\u2019s services in 7,000 of its stores. Square   that one in four active U.S. credit or debit cards paid with Square last year and its businesses get more than 1 billion customer visits. Despite the fast growth, Square has struggled. Doubts linger about its growth prospects as similar devices flood the market and larger rival PayPal spins off from parent EBay Inc. to become a stand-alone payments company. \u201cSquare is running out of runway which may be part of the reason Mr. Dorsey will have more time to spend at Twitter,\u201d Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., said in an e-mail.","timestamp":1434066342.0,"participant_ids":["TWTR:US","4529264Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-12\/dorsey-gets-his-steve-jobs-moment-in-return-to-twitter-ceo-role","subject":"Dorsey Gets a\u00a0Steve Jobs Moment With His\u00a0Return as\u00a0Twitter CEO"},{"body":" Companies that service Alberta\u2019s energy industry, battered by the oil market crash, are feeling the love in neighboring British Columbia. Utility and logistics company Atco Ltd. and drilling-services provider Petrowest Corp. are among Alberta bidders on at least C$45 billion ($36 billion) of hydroelectric and liquefied natural gas projects in British Columbia set to start or be decided in 2015. Growth has slowed in Alberta, where some expansions in the oil sands are on hold because of depressed crude prices. Atco, based in Calgary, is developing a 1,600-person   for workers at the C$8.8 billion Site C hydro-electric dam on the Peace River in northeast British Columbia. Grand Prairie, Alberta-based Petrowest is among pre-qualified bidders for   related to moving earth and building water-diversion tunnels for the dam, which is slated to begin construction by the end of this year. \u201cBritish Columbia has the potential to be the bright light within the energy patch and even within Western Canadian economic development,\u201d said Andrew Bradford, an analyst at Raymond James Ltd. in Calgary. The Conference Board of Canada forecasts the economy in British Columbia will grow 3.1 percent this year, the fastest among the country\u2019s 10 provinces, according to a May 28 report. It expects Alberta to contract by 0.7 percent. Work in British Columbia is already helping Alberta drillers such as Western Energy Services Corp. and frackers including Calfrac Well Services Ltd. partially offset a slowdown across the region after oil prices collapsed by half last year, according to Bradford. The Canadian unit of Petroliam Nasional Bhd., which is proposing a C$36 billion LNG project in British Columbia, is one of the most active producers, with some 20 rigs working at one time in recent months to drill for gas and at least two fracturing crews. While drilling in British Columbia is forecast to fall 20 percent in 2015, that\u2019s less than the 54 percent plunge expected in Alberta as LNG activity takes up some of the slack, according to the Petroleum Services Association of Canada. Some are skeptical that the crude price downturn will continue to ripple through Alberta\u2019s energy economy. The industry has some \u201cresiliency\u201d after a difficult second quarter, Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said Monday in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s head office in New York. \u201cPeople smarter than I are making counter-cyclical bets at the moment,\u201d Nenshi said. \u201cTheir long-term bet is that the cost per barrel is going to come down.\u201d Western Energy\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Alex MacAusland declined by phone to comment on the outlook for services work. Calfrac Chief Financial Officer Mick McNulty didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Work-camp providers such as Horizon North Logistics Inc. and Black Diamond Group Ltd. are best exposed to see share price gains if LNG projects move ahead, according to Raymond James. \u201cThe number of beds that could be required by a single project is about 10,000,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair bit of business and it could more than offset the decline in the oil sands over the next year.\u201d The work created by Petroliam Nasional if it advances its project would be similar in size to Black Diamond\u2019s entire business, said CEO Trevor Haynes. \u201cLNG will be a huge catalyst for the camp business in general,\u201d Haynes said. Atco, which gets about one-fifth of its sales from the structures and logistics unit that builds work camps, is well positioned to supply a range of energy developments in British Columbia, Jason Kielau, an Atco vice-president in the division, said in an e-mail response to questions. Petronas, as the Malaysian state-owned company is known, plans to make a   in the coming weeks on whether to proceed, its CEO said May 22. The LNG project is among   proposed to deliver billions of cubic feet of gas per day to Asia. \u201cIf LNG happens, there\u2019s going to be a lot of opportunity for everybody,\u201d Petrowest CEO Richard Quigley said by phone. Horizon North has already been providing camps to four prospective LNG developers in British Columbia, CEO Rod Graham said by phone. For Horizon North, LNG work may include a 1,000-person open camp -- like a hotel -- in Kitimat and another 2,500-person facility in Prince Rupert, in addition to any other contracts, he said. \u201cIf there is an announcement, you will start to see our gear on the ground,\u201d Graham said. Still, all of the LNG terminals proposed for the British Columbia coast remain in the planning stage while gas and crude-oil pipeline projects face opposition from environmental and aboriginal groups. First Nations and landowners are challenging Site C in court. Sales growth forecasts suggest the worst may not be over for the Alberta-based energy service providers as the plunge in oil and gas prices takes it toll. Sales in the current quarter are projected to fall by 28 percent versus the most-recent three month period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s the biggest drop in six years. The 12-member Standard & Poor\u2019s\/TSX Energy Equipment and Services Index has dropped 1.3 percent this year, compared with a 0.7 percent drop in the Energy Index and a 3.5 percent gain in the broad S&P\/TSX Composite Index. Shares of Atco have dropped 9 percent this year, Petrowest has plunged 57 percent, Calfrac has dropped 10 percent while Western Energy has gained 7.7 percent, Horizon North is up 51 percent and Black Diamond has advanced 30 percent. Now\u2019s the time for investors to start looking at which companies would probably win contracts tied to LNG development and Site C, before work is awarded, said Martin Pelletier, a Calgary-based portfolio manager at TriVest Wealth Counsel Ltd. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly an area for growth,\u201d Pelletier said. He\u2019s also considering British Columbia as he avoids investing in Alberta after the left-of-center New Democratic Party was elected last month, promising to raise corporate taxes, review the rate of royalties collected from energy producers and introduce more stringent climate change policies. British Columbia \u201ccould be a nice diversifying opportunity for those exposed to oil sands,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1433206860.0,"participant_ids":["WRG:CN","HNL:CN","PRW:CN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-02\/british-columbia-energy-dreams-lure-drillers-from-alberta","subject":"British Columbia Energy Dreams Lure Drillers From Alberta"},{"body":" Fosun International Ltd., backed by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, is vying with Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. to acquire 18 buildings on Berlin\u2019s Potsdamer Platz square, people with knowledge of the matter said.

Ametsreiter, 48, is a Telekom Austria veteran of almost two decades. Since taking over as CEO in April 2009, Telekom Austria shares have fallen more than 40 percent. The company has a market value of 3.8 billion euros ($4.3 billion), less than the 4 billion euros in revenue it received in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Carlos Slim\u2019s America Movil is Telekom Austria\u2019s single largest shareholder after it pooled its   with that of the Austrian state last year and made a public offer to minority shareholders. Telekom Austria has since extended cost cuts and slimmed down management in its eastern European units. It also plans to introduce a streaming service that\u2019s similar to America Movil\u2019s Clarovideo offering. Telekom Austria\u2019s sales have fallen by more than 16 percent since 2009 as intense competition at home added to regulatory headwinds and sluggish economies in eastern Europe. The company predicts a return to full-year growth as its profits from booming demand for data used in music and video streaming. Ametsreiter\u2019s term was extended for three years in 2013, with an option for two more years. A decision on whether Ametsreiter would get to serve the full five years would have had to be taken before the end of the year, Telekom Austria spokesman Andreas Perotti said.

If not, he said Google, Microsoft Corp. or Facebook Inc. should make bids for San Francisco-based Twitter. \u201cI believe Twitter can be so much more than it is today,\u201d said Sacca, who invests through his firm, Lowercase Capital LLC. Sacca, known for being Twitter\u2019s biggest cheerleader, has begun publicly criticizing the company for not taking advantage of its strengths. Still, the missive from an influential early investor adds to the burden facing Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo, who has struggled to boost Twitter\u2019s users, even after replacing managers of its product and engineering teams. Twitter\u2019s member base was 302 million monthly users in the first quarter -- about a fifth of Facebook\u2019s audience. Jim Prosser, a spokesman for Twitter, and Winnie King, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-based Google, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Twitter is also holding its annual shareholders meeting today. Twitter should take bigger risks, Sacca said. He pointed out that almost 1 billion people who have used Twitter didn\u2019t stick with it. He predicted that some big changes -- such as apps that would organize posts by topic as opposed to chronologically, or prompts that help users decide what to post -- would bolster Twitter\u2019s appeal. Twitter, which lets users post 140-character updates with photos or video, has \u201cfailed to tell its own story to investors and users,\u201d Sacca said. The stock has dropped 28 percent since late April, when the company   its sales forecast and reported revenue that fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates, prompting some of them to   about management\u2019s credibility and assessment of advertiser and consumer demand. While the stock is up more than 40 percent since a November 2013 initial public offering, it\u2019s about half of the peak set in December of that year. The shares of Twitter rose 1.7 percent to $37 at Wednesday\u2019s close in New York. \u201cThe transition to being public has been rough,\u201d Sacca wrote. \u201cThe company has disappointed Wall Street more often than not. Twitter\u2019s earnings calls are mostly dedicated to playing defense while discussing incremental improvements to sign-up flows and tweaks to the service.\u201d Twitter has the potential to reach 500 million users, Sacca said in his previous blog post  . Sacca, a former adviser to the company, also said then that he hadn\u2019t been \u201cas candid as I could be in public discussions about Twitter.\u201d Sacca also suggested today that Twitter make its service easier to use by building a separate application or service that would curate content, with the help of human editors, focused on particular live events. It would \u201cbe the place everyone visits first to see how the game is going or when the show starts,\u201d without requiring people to log in or Tweet. He also suggested channels within the application that could be destinations for information about particular locations or popular topics. Other organizations, such as the National Basketball Association, could build separate applications that display Twitter posts, he said. Sacca wants Twitter to feel less lonely, and suggests adds like \u201chearts\u201d and read receipts on tweets. \u201cDone right, and done soon, hundreds of millions of new users will join and stay active on the service, hundreds of millions of inactive users will return to the service, and hundreds millions more will use Twitter from the outside,\u201d Sacca wrote.","timestamp":1433343329.0,"participant_ids":["TWTR:US","GOOGL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-03\/twitter-investor-sacca-says-the-service-should-be-easier-to-use","subject":"Google Buying Twitter an \u2018Instant Fit,\u2019 Investor Sacca Says"},{"body":" Longtime Twitter Inc. investor Chris Sacca said the company would be a good fit with Google Inc. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any religion on this board about remaining an independent company,\u201d Sacca said Wednesday on CNBC, when asked whether Twitter should remain independent. \u201cFrom the Google side, it\u2019s an instant fit.\u201d","timestamp":1433352805.0,"participant_ids":["TWTR:US","GOOGL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-03\/twitter-investor-sacca-says-google-would-be-instant-fit-","subject":"Twitter Investor Sacca Says Google Would Be \u2018Instant Fit\u2019"},{"body":"You may soon be able to see every conceivable outcome of a wager, say on interest rates, over many time horizons -- thanks to computers that rely on the uncertainty at the root of all matter. Wall Street\u00a0is\u00a0turning its attention to quantum computers, an emerging technology that aims to exploit the properties of subatomic particles to make extremely complex calculations at unprecedented speeds. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,\u00a0Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, CME Group Inc. and Guggenheim Partners are evaluating quantum computing, which requires temperatures colder than in outer space. The technology is exceptionally complicated, and researchers are debating whether machines now on the market are as powerful as advertised. If successful, these supercomputers could give money managers and banks, whose algorithmic-driven technology already dominate trading, another advantage in a highly competitive market. They can help managers better allocate money to a broad range of assets, find new ways to profit from differences in prices across markets, and value complex derivatives structures, said\u00a0Marcos Lopez de Prado, a senior managing director at Guggenheim Partners. \u201cThe quantum computer is very good at a few things that happen to be very, very hard for traditional computers,\u201d said Lopez de Prado, also a research fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \u201cIt can solve complex problems in exponentially less time.\u201d\u00a0 The cost: at least $10 million per computer, he said. Financial firms are following a handful of companies and governments, including China, France and the U.K., into the world of quantum computing. Lockheed Martin Corp., one of the first adopters, has deployed it to spot bugs in the code that runs F-16 aircraft. Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are developing quantum technologies to speed up software. China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in July announced plans to form a   with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to carry out exploratory work. Google Inc. is designing learning algorithms that work on a quantum computer and is collaborating in its research with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which has one of the machines. It has demonstrated the ability to crunch through very complex problems in a matter of seconds that would take traditional computers 10,000 years, Hartmut Neven, a director of engineering at Google, said at a press conference on Tuesday. \"We have encountered practical problems we would like to solve that are unfeasible with conventional computers,\" said John Giannandrea, Google\u2019s vice president of engineering. \"We want to understand the future that may lie ahead of us in non-conventional\u00a0 computers.\" The quantum computers that can be bought today are made by\u00a0D-Wave Systems Inc., a 16-year-old Canadian company. D-Wave has raised C$174 million ($130 million) from backers, including Goldman Sachs, which has invested its own money in the company. At Goldman Sachs, engineers are considering using the technology, as is CME Group, the largest futures exchange, according to people who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman, declined to comment. Alex Gorbokon, a spokeswoman for CME, said the exchange is \u201calways looking at new technologies.\u201d Researchers including Guggenheim\u2019s Lopez de Prado and Peter Carr, a\u00a0Morgan Stanley managing director, said in a   in August that they demonstrated the potential of quantum computing to help asset managers solve a difficult problem: wagering on a set of assets over a time horizon that\u2019s divided into multiple steps. The manager must decide how much to invest in each asset at each step, while taking into account transaction and market-impact costs. Managers today make their calls after traditional computers are fed historical data and forecasts for everything from interest rates and unemployment to stock and currency prices. Conventional technology is able to evaluate millions of possible investment scenarios to guide managers. \u201cThat\u2019s a drop in the ocean,\u201d said Lopez de Prado. \u201cQuantum technology can evaluate all possible scenarios in order to produce an optimized portfolio that can deliver the best risk-adjusted return.\u201d The performance of today\u2019s binary computers is determined by the number of transistors that fit into a space and how cleverly engineers can connect them. Each transistor can essentially be switched on or off, which maps to zeros and ones -- or the bits -- in code that fuels the computer\u2019s processor. Quantum computers use qubits, which are based on measuring the properties of subatomic particles, as their most basic element. At any point in time, a qubit can be either a zero, a one, or somewhere in between. This means qubits in a quantum computer can explore a far larger number of possibilities than the zero-or-one bits in a typical computer to find the most efficient answer to a math problem, resulting in its greater power and speed. For D-Wave\u2019s computer to work properly and stop its qubits from interacting with other particles, its thumbnail-sized computer chip is encased in a large box, where it is cooled to temperatures of about minus 459 Fahrenheit (minus 273.15 Celsius). CME is an investor in Canadian software firm 1QB Information Technologies, which helps companies write applications for quantum computers. 1QBit is working with a handful of financial institutions, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, said Andrew Fursman, co-founder of 1QBit. \"We\u2019ve reached out to a number of large financial institutions and have a number of projects on the go,\" he said. Simon McNamara, the chief administrative officer at RBS, told The Telegraph that quantum computing will play some role in finance, performing tasks in seconds that currently take days to complete. D-Wave\u2019s machines are spurring debate among researchers who question if they are truly quantum in operation. A   published in 2014 found no evidence that D-Wave\u2019s technology solved a task faster than a traditional computer using quantum methods. Then a   published this summer found that the D-Wave machine displayed some quantum characteristics. That prompted Scott Aaronson, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to   that while researchers don\u2019t fully understand the characteristics of its machine, \"D-Wave and the others are in this for the long haul.\" Lopez de Prado said the criticism is immaterial. \"I\u2019m not so worried about how or why the computer solves the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a practical perspective what is clear is that this computer is able to do things that traditional computers can not.\u201d (An earlier version of this story corrected the name of 1QB Information Technologies.)","timestamp":1449630001.0,"participant_ids":["GS:US","CME:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-09\/quantum-supercomputers-entice-wall-street-vowing-higher-returns","subject":"Quantum Computers Entice Wall Street Vowing Higher Returns"},{"body":" A group of buildings on Berlin\u2019s Potsdamer Platz, one of Germany\u2019s most famous squares, will be offered for sale for about 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion), according to people with knowledge of the plan.

Potsdamer Platz, now dominated by luxury hotels and office towers, was a bombed-out wasteland for 50 years after World War II, with the wall dividing east and west Berlin tearing through it. After reunification, Daimler AG and Sony Corp. invested more than 1 billion euros to build a complex of futuristic skyscrapers and cinemas around a roofed-in plaza that\u2019s now one of Berlin\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. SEB\u2019s stake in the complex includes the Mandala Hotel, a CinemaxX cinema and the Arkaden shopping mall, according to SEB\u2019s Potsdamer Platz website. The property, designed by architects including Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, has about 500,000 square meters (5.4 million square feet) of restaurants, offices, apartments, shops, public plazas and streets, the website shows.

Buoyed by low debt levels and cash at a record, Promotora y Operadora de Infraestructura SAB boasts a better average recommendation from analysts than competitors including Empresas ICA SAB, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It\u2019s also favored over names such as America Movil SAB, Mexico\u2019s biggest company by market value. Pinfra is positioned to take advantage when infrastructure projects start to pick up, said Casa de Bolsa Ve Por Mas SA analyst Marco Medina. Builders\u2019 shares   last year after Mexico canceled a contract with China Railway Construction Corp. amid reports a partner in the deal built a luxury home for the president\u2019s wife. The stocks took another hit in late January after an oil rout led the country to  . \u201cIf we compare Pinfra with others in the sector the difference is huge,\u201d Medina said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe company is generating cash, while others are in need of cash for investments and financial costs, and that limits them from participating in new projects.\u201d Medina is one of 13 analysts that recommend buying the stock, pushing its rating to 4.56 out of 5, the highest among 35 companies on Mexico\u2019s IPC Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Three analysts recommend holding the shares; no one says sell. Pinfra\u2019s cash from operations including toll roads rose 50 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. Its cash and equivalents reached 10 billion pesos from 3.3 billion a year earlier, more than either ICA or OHL Mexico SAB de CV, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Free cash flow was 1.4 billion pesos ($90 million) at the end of March. Pinfra has amassed more cash than competitors due to lower debt costs and strategic bids on highways with steady traffic, such as one near the site of Mexico City\u2019s new planned airport, Medina said. Pinfra saves on costs by contracting builders to carry out its highway projects, avoiding the expense of owning and transporting heavy equipment, Medina said. Usually, \u201cConstruction risk requires very large capital investment,\u201d he said. With its business model, \u201cPinfra doesn\u2019t have to make such large investments.\u201d ICA participates directly in portions of construction, while OHL often subcontracts to its parent company, Spain\u2019s Obrascon Huarte Lain SA, said Hugo Mendoza, an analyst at Invex Casa de Bolsa. The savings have helped Chief Executive Officer David Penaloza Alanis reduce Pinfra\u2019s net debt to negative 0.7 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the first quarter, Bloomberg data shows. That compares with net debt levels of 9.3 times Ebitda for ICA and 2.6 times for OHL. \u201cPinfra has a strong balance sheet that allows it to grow in different scenarios of the economy,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Carlos Cesarman said in an interview in Mexico City, where the company is based. \u201cPinfra can grow by purchasing or bidding on projects coming into the market in the next year.\u201d The main driver for growth will be new infrastructure projects, Cesarman said, though the company will consider buying assets from companies and the government. Spokesmen for OHL and ICA didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Pinfra was little changed at 173.88 pesos at the close of trading Tuesday in Mexico City. The shares increased 4.6 percent in the three months ended last week, while OHL gained 8.6 percent and ICA fell 13 percent. Pinfra trailed OHL and the 8.9 percent gain of the IPC because it\u2019s hard for the stock to keep climbing after a surge of more than 6,400 percent since being relisted in December 2005, Mendoza said. Booking a new project will trigger a rally, he said. The company continues to impress shareholders by pre-paying debt, and it\u2019s well-positioned to bid on two highways that the government is expected to tender in coming weeks, according to Jose Helue at Interacciones. \u201cThere are many points about Pinfra that we really like,\u201d Helue said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bet that\u2019s relatively low risk due to its balance sheets and debt, and it keeps showing a capacity to grow and correctly choose what it will invest in.\u201d The rise of Pinfra marks a comeback for the company after the collapse of predecessor Grupo Tribasa SA, which missed a bond payment in 1999 and was delisted from the Mexican stock exchange in 2001. Following a 2003 agreement with creditors, Pinfra changed its name and was relisted in 2005, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Public works in Mexico will get a boost from extra revenue the government announced last week, Medina of Ve Por Mas said. Mexico\u2019s central bank will send 31.4 billion pesos to the government from a 2014 operational surplus after setting aside reserves as required by law, the Finance Ministry said April 28. President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s administration said it would propose channeling the funds to joint infrastructure investments with the private sector next year. Even so, a public works rebound may take its time to materialize, according to Javier Gayol, an analyst at Corporativo GBM SAB. The government pared this year\u2019s outlays by 124.3 billion pesos, or 0.7 percent of gross domestic product, and will reduce spending by an additional 0.7 percent of GDP next year, the Finance Ministry said March 31. Mexican infrastructure stocks slumped after news website Aristegui Noticias reported in November that a unit of Grupo Higa, one of the high-speed train bidders with China Railway, built and holds the title of a home for First lady Angelica Rivera. She has said she will sell her rights to the house,  and the president\u2019s office has denied any   of interest. Gayol of GBM said that even if public projects remain sluggish for the next year and a half, Pinfra stands to gain as it can put up more capital in partnerships with the government. \u201cThe spending issue will affect the government sector in 2015 and 2016,\u201d Gayol said. \u201cThat will actually help Pinfra.\u201d","timestamp":1430776800.0,"participant_ids":["ICA*:MM","OHLMEX*:MM"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-05\/top-rated-mexico-stock-pinfra-poised-for-rebound-in-public-works","subject":"Top-Rated Mexico Stock Pinfra Poised for Rebound in Public Works"},{"body":"Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which owns futures markets and the New York Stock Exchange, agreed to buy Trayport from BGC Partners Inc. for $650 million in stock, adding a key piece of infrastructure in the European energy trading industry. The technology developed by London-based Trayport, which ICE is buying in exchange for 2.5 million shares, helps brokers and energy producers trade power, natural gas and coal products in Europe. ICE already dominates European energy trading given its control of markets for refined products, natural gas and Brent crude oil, the primary global benchmark for oil. Trayport expands its reach in the less-regulated over-the-counter energy markets. \u201cTrayport is a valuable asset in the energy space,\" Chris Allen, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients after the sale was announced Monday. \"The asset adds incremental market data and is a fairly broadly used subscription-based trading platform.\" The deal keeps Trayport out of the hands of ICE\u2019s top competitor, CME Group Inc., which tried to buy it as part of its failed 2014 bid for GFI Group. BGC ultimately purchased GFI and is now selling the Trayport division to ICE. Shares of ICE gained after the transaction was announced, rising 1.4 percent to $262.10 at 4 p.m. New York time. BGC advanced 5 percent to $9.02. Europe is reshaping its financial markets with Mifid II, a regulatory overhaul set to take effect over the next several years. Some markets will see increased trading obligations such as mandatory clearing -- or backing trades to help lessen the harm if a trading partner goes bankrupt. \u201cEuropean regulators have made clear that they do not expect OTC gas and power markets to be subject to the mandatory clearing provisions that are being applied to other commodity markets,\u201d\u00a0ICE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sprecher said in a statement Monday. \u201cThese vital markets will require continued investment as part of the European energy market evolution.\u201d The deal,\u00a0which is subject to regulatory approval, comes three weeks after ICE   it would pay $5.2 billion to buy Interactive Data Corp., adding a service that helps price corporate bonds. ICE expects to complete the deal in the first quarter of 2016.

That\u2019s what strategists at JPMorgan Chase said last week in\u00a0a gathering at the firm\u2019s Madison Avenue office to discuss their 2016 outlook. \u201cIn some sense, the fact that CME and LCH swaps are trading at different yield levels by about five basis points now on the 30-year\u2014that\u2019s much weirder than negative swap spreads,\u201d said Joshua Younger, an interest rate derivative strategist at JPMorgan, at the Dec. 2 meeting. \u201cThat\u2019s the same instrument. It\u2019s another example of the unintended consequences of how markets have changed in the past\u00a010\u00a0years.\u201d Under provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 that came into effect in late 2013, interest rate swaps that once traded over-the-counter have been migrating to central clearing platforms dominated in the U.S. by the CME Group and LCH.Clearnet Group. Regulators' actions sought to stem odds of another financial crisis as clearinghouses cut risk by collecting collateral at the start of each transaction, monitoring daily price moves, and making traders put up more cash as losses occur. While CME and LCH dominate as central clearinghouses for U.S. swaps, the market has become segmented with clients, such as hedge funds, dealing more with the CME and LCH focused more on interdealer clearing. The preference of large asset managers to clear swaps through the CME is said to be due to heightened netting effects, as much of their futures trades use that exchange. That has helped trigger the higher rates on this platform, widening what is known as the CME\/LCH basis, according to JPMorgan. Interest rate swap spreads, the difference between the rate to exchange fixed- for floating-payment streams and similar-maturity Treasury yields, are\u00a0now negative for maturities between five and 30 years, with many maturities reaching record gaps this year. This move, triggered by a mix of factors,  \u00a0to the fact that post-crisis regulations on banks have reduced their capacity to warehouse debt securities and caused them to cut activity in the so-called repo\u00a0market. In the CME\/LCH basis, \u201cwhat you see is a flows imbalance between client and dealer trades that becomes exacerbated in certain situations,\u201d Younger added in the Dec. 2 talk. \u201cThe counterparty credit quality is the same.

Andre Esteves and Delcidio Amaral, the leader of the government coalition in the Senate, were detained after allegedly trying to interfere in testimony related to a pay-to-play scheme at the state-run oil giant, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, according to a court document. Amaral is the highest-ranking politician to be arrested in the scandal. Esteves denied any wrongdoing through his lawyer as BTG\u00a0Pactual named board member Persio Arida as interim chief executive. The lender also said the board approved on Wednesday a plan to buy back as many as 23 million units over the next 18 months, according to a regulatory filing. That didn\u2019t stop the stock from falling 21 percent, its steepest drop since the company went public in 2012, bringing its market value to 22.9 billion reais ($6.1 billion). The yields on the company\u2019s $1 billion of bonds maturing in 2020 surged above 12 percent from about 6.5 percent on Tuesday. The arrests usher in a new phase of a massive graft scandal that has crippled Brazil\u2019s economy and left President Dilma Rousseff fighting for her political survival. The nation\u2019s currency and stocks, which had stabilized in recent weeks after being in a free fall for much of the year, posted the worst drop among major markets Wednesday amid concern the scandal will prolong political gridlock and the longest recession since the Great Depression. \u201cThe arrest of Mr. Esteves, the most high-profile figure in Brazilian finance, takes the Petrobras probe to a whole new level and shows the depth and breadth of a scandal that\u2019s engulfing Brazil\u2019s political and corporate establishment,\" said Nicholas Spiro, managing director at Spiro Sovereign Strategy, in London. \"The scandal is becoming more debilitating by the day and is severely undermining the prospects for any kind of meaningful economic reform.\u201d Amaral allegedly tried to convince former Petrobras director Nestor Cervero, who was arrested in January, to not mention him or Esteves in testimony to federal prosecutors, according to a document of the accusations read aloud in Brasilia Wednesday by Judge Teori Zavascki. Cervero\u2019s family would have received 50,000 reais ($13,000) every month in the proposal, and Esteves \u201cwould bear the burden of financial aid,\u201d according to the document. The offer also included a promised 4 million-real payment to Cervero\u2019s lawyer. Prosecutors cited in their request for the arrests a taped conversation in which Amaral indicated Esteves had obtained a copy of testimony by Cervero, according court documents. Prosecutors said the former Petrobras director described in his testimony alleged bribes made to use the BR Distribuidora brand at a chain of 120 gas stations Banco BTG Pactual had invested in. Cervero worked as a CFO of the distribution unit until March 2014. Esteves\u2019 lawyer, Antonio Carlos de Almeida Castro, said in a phone interview that Esteves denies any wrongdoing. He said the arrests are based on a recording in which Amaral used Esteves\u2019 name unduly, and that Esteves doesn\u2019t know Cervero. \"Information is being twisted,\" he said, adding that Esteves has completed his testimony to police. Esteves was detained this morning at his house in Rio de Janeiro, Castro said. Televised images showed Esteves, 47, being escorted by a police officer into the federal police office in Rio de Janeiro. He sported a white button-down shirt, no tie and light stubble on his face as he walked past reporters to an elevator. Sandra Pires, a partner at law firm Rao & Pires Advogados, said Esteves\u2019 defense team is researching the arrest order, which allows for him to be held for as many as five days and can be extended. BTG Pactual said in an e-mailed statement that it is cooperating with the investigation and is willing to explain whatever is necessary to authorities. Eduardo Marzagao, a spokesman for Amaral, said he was \u201csurprised\u201d by the arrest. \u201cIt must be a big mistake,\" he said. In an e-mailed statement, Amaral\u2019s lawyer, Mauricio Silva Leite, said the\u00a0accusations came from a convicted plea bargainer seeking to obtain legal favors in exchange for information, and questioned the legality of an arrest of a senator without formal charges. More than 110 people have already been arrested, including former executives at Petrobras and at Odebrecht SA, Brazil\u2019s biggest construction conglomerate. While most of the detainees have been released, at least three former Petrobras directors, three former executives at one of Brazil\u2019s largest construction firms and the former treasurer for the ruling Worker\u2019s Party have been sentenced. The sweeping investigation into Petrobras -- dubbed \u201cCarwash\u201d by prosecutors after a gas station used to launder money -- has helped make Brazil\u2019s real the world\u2019s worst-performing major currency this year. Brazil\u2019s economy is forecast to shrink more than 3 percent in 2015, according to a central bank survey of economists published Monday. Esteves has been involved in various deals with Petrobras over the years, most notably Sete Brasil. BTG\u00a0teamed up with Petrobras and other partners in 2010 to create the rig-supplier whose former operating chief admitted in plea bargains to crimes of corruption. New arrests suggest the full impact of Carwash, or Lava Jato in Portuguese, \u201cis still to come,\u201d Joao Augusto de Castro Neves, director of Latin America for political consulting firm Eurasia Group, said in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cBTG Pactual has exposure to the oil and gas sector, and the arrest of its CEO is the first time the Lava Jato probe raises the earnest prospect of financial contagion.\u201d","timestamp":1448478650.0,"participant_ids":["BBTG11:BZ","PETR4:BZ"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-25\/btg-pactual-tanks-as-petrobras-probe-leads-to-chairman-s-arrest","subject":"BTG Pactual Tanks as Petrobras Probe Leads to Chairman's Arrest"},{"body":"Andre Esteves,\u00a0the brash banker who once joked his firm\u2019s name, Grupo BTG Pactual, stood for \u2018better than Goldman,\u2019 became the latest high-profile executive dragged into Brazil\u2019s widening corruption scandal. The 47-year-old billionaire was arrested Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro,\u00a0along with Senator Delcidio Amaral, police said.\u00a0Esteves allegedly sought an agreement with Amaral to interfere with testimony from\u00a0a jailed former executive of oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA, according to a court document. Esteves made a splash on the international financial stage -- and became Brazil\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire -- when he sold Pactual to UBS for $2.6 billion in 2006.\u00a0He and partners bought it back three years later and set off on an expansion, snapping up businesses including the Swiss private-banking unit of Assicurazioni Generali SpA. The firm sold shares to the public in 2012. \u201cHe epitomizes the idea of a private, successful, entrepreneurial generation of Brazilian bankers -- that\u2019s what he represents,\u201d\u00a0said Felipe Monteiro, a professor of strategy at Insead in France. His alleged involvement \u201cwith the most classic type of old politics is somehow strange.\u201d Esteves joins more than 100 people who have already been arrested, including former top executives at state-owned Petrobras and Brazil\u2019s biggest construction conglomerate.\u00a0The sweeping investigation into alleged corruption at Petrobras, which began in March 2014, has helped make Brazil\u2019s real the worst-performing major currency this year, contributed to an economic contraction and shaken the government of President Dilma Rousseff.\u00a0Shares of BTG Pactual dropped as much as 39 percent on Wednesday, the most ever. \u201cThe risk to the firm is that Andre Esteves is the firm,\u201d said Mark Williams, author of \u201cUncontrolled Risk,\u201d a book on the rise and collapse of Lehman Brothers. \u201cThere is not a charismatic number 2 executive groomed and ready to lead.\u201d BTG Pactual said it appointed Persio Arida, a former governor of Brazil\u2019s central bank and BTG\u2019s managing partner, as interim chief executive officer. The firm said in an e-mailed statement it\u2019s cooperating with the investigation, declining to comment on the question of succession. Esteves\u2019 lawyer, Antonio Carlos de Almeida Castro, said in a phone interview that Esteves isn\u2019t guilty and wasn\u2019t involved in the actions he\u2019s accused of. Esteves was born in Rio, in the middle-class Tijuca neighborhood. An only child whose main interests were reading, studying and playing soccer,\u00a0as a teenager he became fascinated\u00a0by computers, he said in a 2007 interview. He went on to study computer science at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. He started his career fixing computers at Pactual in 1989.\u00a0Within two years,\u00a0the bank\u2019s founder, Luiz Cezar Fernandes, had assigned him accounting and administrative jobs in the back office of the trading desk. Fernandes, in an interview in 2007, said he took a liking to Esteves early on because both men came from middle-class families and had no financial education or ties to Brazil\u2019s traditional, family-owned banking community. Esteves later teamed up with three partners to engineer a boardroom maneuver that toppled his mentor. \u201cI was surprised when they turned against me,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cBut nobody could argue with a guy who was making a lot of money for the bank.\u201d Making money was something Esteves said he excelled at, and enjoyed.\u00a0He oversaw the fixed-income team at Pactual from 1993 to 1996, and became a managing partner in 2002.\u00a0Less than a year after UBS bought the firm, it put Esteves in charge of global fixed-income sales and trading. He moved to London and oversaw more than 1,000 people. \u201cI like making money,\u201d Esteves said after he was appointed to that job. \u201cI\u2019m good at making money. It\u2019s exciting to create wealth.\u201d Before long the financial crisis swept across the globe, crippling UBS with more than $50 billion of losses and writedowns and spurring a government rescue. After quitting to form BTG, Esteves joined up with\u00a0some of his former partners to buy Pactual for $2.5 billion. He\u2019s built the firm into Latin America\u2019s largest independent investment bank. It was the leading arranger of stock sales in the region in 2013, and again so far this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Esteves donated an undisclosed sum to Harvard Business School in 2013 to renovate Baker Hall. A residence facility used by visiting executives, it was renamed Esteves Hall. Esteves\u2019 personal fortune has been falling, however, not rising. His riches peaked at $4.9 billion in September of 2014. He\u2019s now less than half as wealthy, as his net worth dipped below $2 billion on Wednesday,\u00a0according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He shed hundreds of millions of dollars in value earlier   as his firm was dragged down by loans and investments with companies embroiled in the Petrobras scandal. Esteves has been involved in deals with the oil giant over the years, most notably involving Sete Brasil Participacoes SA. BTG Pactual teamed up with Petrobras and other partners in 2010 to create the oil-rig supplier, whose former operating chief admitted in plea bargains to crimes of corruption. Sete Brasil is in talks to renegotiate its supply contract with Petrobras, while BTG had to book impairments on its investment in the second and third quarters. \u201cHe was the key guy, and now it\u2019s a kingdom without its king,\u201d\u00a0Ray Zucaro, chief investment officer at RVX Asset Management in Miami, said in an e-mail. \u201cAs an outside investor it does give me pause, I just don\u2019t know where the next shoe will drop.\u201d","timestamp":1448469756.0,"participant_ids":["BBTG11:BZ","PETR4:BZ"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-25\/how-brazil-s-banking-golden-boy-arrested-in-rio-built-empire","subject":"How Brazil's Banking Golden Boy, Arrested in Rio, Built an Empire"},{"body":"Hollywood movie studios spend millions of dollars promoting their Oscar contenders in the final months of the year, yet the favorite to win the Academy Award for best picture of 2015 is a film backed by the two biggest U.S. theater owners. \u201cSpotlight\u201d stars Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo as the Boston Globe journalists who broke the story about the Catholic Church hierarchy\u2019s cover-up of a pedophile scandal. The picture has a 9-2 chance to win best picture, according to a panel of critics, writers and others surveyed by GoldDerby.com, an industry website. A big nomination would burnish the artistic reputation of Open Road Films, which was founded almost five years ago by Regal Entertainment Group and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. That could come as soon as Thursday when the Golden Globes nominations are announced by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. \u201cSpotlight\u201d is a shoo-in to be a finalist for  , according to GoldDerby. \u201cIt does change a lot,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Tom Ortenberg said in an interview. When Open Road is associated with high quality movies, \u201cpeople in Hollywood, they take notice.\u201d Regal and AMC operate far from the glitz and glamor of the film industry. AMC, based in Kansas City, Missouri, was   by China\u2019s Dalian Wanda Group Co. in 2012 and went public the next year, while Regal is based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The companies created Open Road in 2011 to acquire and distribute films because Hollywood studios weren\u2019t making enough to fill their seats. In recent years, studios like Warner Bros., owned by Time Warner Inc., and Walt Disney Co. have focused on a smaller number of big-budget releases based on known properties such as DC Comics or Marvel, while cutting back on less expensive, star-driven dramas. Making sequels is seen as less risky than producing original concepts. That created a void for films like \u201cSpotlight,\u201d which appeal to fans outside the younger demographic that the studios target with blockbuster films. Last year the company also distributed the critically acclaimed \u201cNightcrawler\u201d and \u201cChef.\u201d Potential Oscar winners, while often not as big commercially as a superhero film, can enjoy an extended run in theaters, bolstered by publicity surrounding annual nominations and awards. Still, the awards are dominated by the major Hollywood studios. 20th Century Fox backed the last two Oscar winners and this year has \u201cThe Martian,\u201d the Matt Damon space adventure. It\u2019s running second at GoldDerby at 7-to-1. The film has generated $573.3 million in worldwide ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo. Fox also has No. 3, \u201cThe Revenant.\u201d Open Road hasn\u2019t had a big impact on the box office yet. It has distributed six films this year, including \u201cSpotlight,\u201d and has generated just $59 million at the domestic box office, out of a total of $9.97 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s not a major driver yet, but it\u2019s profitable and getting there,\u201d\u00a0said Eric Wold, an analyst with B. Riley & Co. Changes in the entertainment industry have sometimes led to tensions between cinema chains and studios. Both are under pressure from digital distributors like Netflix Inc. that have drawn fans away from cinemas and DVDs. Theaters have also been resisting pressure from studios to shorten the months of exclusivity they typically get before movies go to home video. Amid the turbulence, Open Road is giving the theater chains more control over what\u2019s shown onscreen. While the company was formed originally to fill the gaps left by studios, the ambitions have changed, said Ortenberg, an executive producer of the film. \u201cSpotlight,\u201d which cost $15 million to produce, is one of Open Road\u2019s biggest risks to date. The company got involved when it was just a script, said Ortenberg, a former executive at Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and The Weinstein Co.\u00a0\u201cSleepless Night,\u201d a thriller due in 2016, will be its first fully financed movie produced in-house, he said. \u201cWhen we were first starting four-plus years ago, we weren\u2019t in a position to help create our own movies,\u201d Ortenberg said. Now, the distributor can \u201cget involved earlier, like we did at the script stage with this, and help shape things.\u201d","timestamp":1449655200.0,"participant_ids":["0488629D:US","0811546D:US","AMC:US","RGC:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-09\/-spotlight-puts-theaters-own-studio-out-front-in-oscar-race","subject":"'Spotlight' Puts Theaters' Own Studio Out Front in Oscar Race"},{"body":" It didn\u2019t take long for Amy Poehler and Tina Fey to dish the latest Hollywood dirt. The comics, co-hosts of the Golden Globe Awards, opened the show by greeting all the \u201cdespicable, spoiled, minimally talented brats\u201d in attendance, riffing on producer Scott Rudin\u2019s remarks about actress Angelina Jolie in an e-mail leaked by hackers last month. The awards, handed out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, honor outstanding performances in film and TV. \u201cTonight we celebrate all the television shows we know and love, as well as all the movies North Korea was OK with,\u201d Fey quipped. The industry became an easy target for joke writers this year after cyber-terrorists hacked Sony Pictures, releasing thousands of e-mails in which executives wrote, sometimes unkindly, about the people with whom they work. The hacking, which the FBI has said bears hallmarks of North Korea, was presumed retribution for the Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy \u201cThe Interview\u201d that depicts the fictional assassination of the country\u2019s leader. \u201cThe biggest story in Hollywood this year was when North Korea threatened an attack if Sony Pictures released \u2018The Interview\u2019 -- forcing us all to pretend we wanted to see it,\u201d Poehler said. Fey piped in: \u201cNorth Korea referred to \u2018The Interview\u2019 as \u2018absolutely intolerable\u2019 and a wanton act of terror. Even more amazing: not the worst review the movie got.\u201d Comedian Margaret Cho appeared in recurring skits as a North Korean general who was less than amused. \u201cIn North Korea we know how to put on a show -- this is not a show,\u201d she said. \u201cYou no have Dennis Rodman. No basketball at all.\u201d The hacking exposed Sony Pictures co-Chairman Amy Pascal\u2019s e-mail banter with producer Rudin, which prompted them both to apologize publicly. Pascal last month was photographed receiving what the New York Daily News called a \u201cstone-cold stare\u201d from Jolie, the actress Rudin had called a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d in one exchange with Pascal. The show set aside all jokes for a moment near the top of the show in a reverent reference to last week\u2019s terrorist attack against the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper in Paris. Theo Kingma, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, received a standing ovation for his comments in defense of free speech. The Sony hacking wasn\u2019t the only current event to incur barbs from the co-hosts. Poehler went after Bill Cosby, the comedian who has been accused by multiple women of serving them drug-laced beverages and sexually assaulting them, while referring to the film \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d a musical mash-up of various Grimms fairy tales. \u201cSleeping Beauty just thought she was getting coffee with Bill Cosby,\u201d Poehler said.

Frere, who turns 89 today, is stepping down as chief executive officer of GBL and as vice chairman and executive director of its biggest shareholder, Pargesa SA, both of which he controls with Canada\u2019s Desmarais family, the companies   this week. Frere and the Desmarais family have diversified the company away from the French energy and water giants Total SA, GDF Suez SA and Suez Environnement to make way for investments in smaller companies such as Umicore, a materials specialist, and private-equity stakes. Returns for shareholders from the strategy have so far been limited. \u201cThe change emerged out of a frustration from a lack of influence at the board level in some of these large companies,\u201d Hans D\u2019Haese, analyst at Banque Degroof SA, said by telephone from Brussels. \u201cNow they have taken stakes in smaller companies in which they have a bigger say.\u201d GBL shares have returned 6.7 percent annually over the past five years, including dividends, trailing the median return of 14 percent for Western European investment companies with a market value greater than $1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cGBL\u2019s long-term performance is quite OK, while over the short term, over the past five years, it has been below peers,\u201d D\u2019Haese said by telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to assess the new strategy.\u201d A spokeswoman for GBL in Brussels declined to comment on the company\u2019s performance. The shift into holdings in smaller companies and alternative investments is designed to reduce \u201ccountry risk\u201d and give GBL influence through stakes of as much as 30 percent, according to the latest investor presentation on GBL\u2019s  . The result has been a lowering of the holding in Total to 3.2 percent from 4 percent before 2013 and a plan to sell off holdings in GDF Suez and Suez Environnement through convertible bonds. GBL owns stakes in seven publicly traded companies that it considers \u201cstrategic\u201d investments -- Total, GDF Suez, Suez Environnement, Lafarge SA, SGS SA, Pernod Ricard SA and Imerys. The goal is for those to account for 75 percent to 80 percent of assets, with 10 percent to 15 percent in so-called incubator holdings in smaller companies that may or not be listed, according to the company\u2019s  . The rest of the portfolio is in financial investments such as private-equity stakes or debt holdings. Frere cultivated longstanding relationships with energy barons in France, including GDF Suez SA Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet and former Total chief Christophe de Margerie. France, where the economy has barely grown in three years, also was the country where Frere and Paul Desmarais Sr. made their first investment together. The pair created Pargesa in 1981 to manage a stake in Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Suisse), a subsidiary of the French bank now known as BNP Paribas SA. The French investments put them at the center of some of the country\u2019s biggest deals. Frere took a stake in Belgian oil company Petrofina SA in the early 1980s, which later turned him into one of Total\u2019s biggest shareholders after the French oil company swallowed Petrofina and Elf Aquitaine SA. GBL has been listed on the stock market since 1956 and controlled by the Frere and Desmarais families since 1990.","timestamp":1422997260.0,"participant_ids":["FP:FP","GSZ:FP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-03\/retiring-billionaire-frere-shifted-focus-from-france","subject":"Retiring Billionaire Frere Shifted Focus From France"},{"body":" \u201cFurious 7\u201d led the U.S. box office for the fourth straight weekend, setting up a showdown with the next \u201cAvengers\u201d movie for the top pick of moviegoers.

Cimento Tupi SA\u2019s $185 million of bonds due 2018 have plummeted 70 percent this year as the construction industry is roiled by accusations that some builders paid bribes to Petrobras executives in return for contracts. At 27 cents on the dollar, the notes indicate bondholders are bracing for Tupi to miss its next interest payment due May 11, according to Galloway Gestora de Recursos and Bulltick LLC. Tupi\u2019s case is emblematic of the collateral damage wrought by the investigation at a time when Brazil\u2019s economy is also floundering. Construction and engineering companies Galvao Engenharia SA and OAS SA have already missed debt payments and filed for bankruptcy protection after the allegations choked off their access to bond financing. \u201cWe can definitely see a scenario of contagion in Brazil when it comes to construction companies and segments related to it,\u201d Patrik Kauffman, a money manager at Solitaire Aquila Ltd., said from Zurich. Cesar Lage, Tupi\u2019s chief financial officer, didn\u2019t return telephone or e-mail messages seeking comment on the slump in its bonds and whether the company will make its debt payment. Rio de Janeiro-based Tupi had 9.4 million reais ($3.18 million) of cash and equivalents as of December, according to data from the company. Fitch Ratings cut Tupi\u2019s rating to CCC, eight levels into junk, on March 20, citing the company\u2019s low cash levels. \u201cIt\u2019s become a perfect storm with the credit scenario in Brazil following\u201d the Petrobras probe, Jay Djemal, an analyst at Fitch, said from Chicago. \u201cThey\u2019re very restricted on their ability to refinance from a large number of sources.\u201d Lending to the construction industry has dried up after Petrobras banned 27 contractors cited in the corruption investigation from bidding on government contracts. Earlier this month, Grupo Schahin, which has operations in the construction, engineering and oil and gas industries, also sought creditor protection for 28 of its companies in Brazil. The $651 million of bonds due 2022 and issued by one of its financial units have tumbled about 45 percent this year to 44.5 cents on the dollar. Schahin, Galvao Engenharia and OAS have all denied the allegations against them. At 71 percent, Tupi\u2019s bonds now yield 60.55 percentage points more than U.S. Treasuries -- well above the threshold for distressed securities, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \u201cThe market is already telling the company what to do,\u201d which is restructure, Ulisses de Oliveira, a money manager from Galloway Gestora de Recursos in Sao Paulo, said in an e-mail. Brazil\u2019s real advanced 1.2 percent to 2.9151 per U.S. dollar Monday as of 3:06 p.m. in New York, paring its decline this year to 9 percent. Compounding the lack of financing for companies like Tupi is a contraction in Brazil\u2019s economy that is forecast to be the biggest in 25 years. \u201cThis company can definitely be seen as another victim of the main problems Brazil is going through,\u201d Klaus Spielkamp, head of fixed-income sales at Bulltick LLC, said from Miami.","timestamp":1430085600.0,"participant_ids":["PETR4:BZ","8253294Z:BZ"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-27\/petrobras-fallout-pushes-even-untainted-borrowers-toward-default","subject":"Petrobras Fallout Pushes Even Untainted Borrowers Toward Default"},{"body":" The regulator of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae plans to ease annual restrictions on their apartment mortgage business to prevent a lending slowdown, according to two people familiar with the matter. The government-controlled companies, which buy and guarantee mortgages, are on track to reach a $30 billion annual cap in their multifamily business in the third quarter. The Federal Housing Finance Agency intends to tell the companies this week how it will loosen the limits that it had set in January, the people said. Without an easing of the restrictions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could have to hold back business in the second half of the year, resulting in higher costs to borrowers and less available multifamily credit. Fannie Mae might also have to slow sales of loans to investors. The companies have begun demanding wider interest rate spreads in an attempt to reduce their pace of business. \u201cOur sense is that the current situation is unsustainable as the lack of market clarity will ultimately have an impact on multifamily credit availability,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC. Housing officials in the last month discussed several options for relaxing the limits, including raising the caps by $5 billion for each company, said one of the people. They have also considered broadening the criteria to make more mortgages exempt from the limit, the person said. FHFA spokeswoman Stefanie Johnson declined to comment. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s apartment business surged four-fold through April from a year ago, spurred by low interest rates and demand for rental units. Freddie financed $10 billion in multifamily loans in the first quarter, trailing just behind rival Fannie with $10.4 billion, both companies have reported. The FHFA would be in uncharted territory if it makes changes to the mortgage limits mid-year rather than in January, said Lisa Pendergast, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC. \u201cIt would be unusual for them to think about raising the caps now, but on the other hand, by summer, they could hit the ceiling,\u201d she said by phone this week. \u201cThey may have to shut down origination if that happens.\u201d Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began tapping the brakes by boosting their costs of borrowing, which may cause business to move to private lenders, according to Willy Walker, chief executive officer at Walker & Dunlop, one of the firms\u2019 biggest multifamily lending partners. \u201cFreddie and Fannie got ahead of themselves, and now they\u2019re trying to temper themselves by raising their rates,\u201d Walker said. Freddie Mac increased the cost on its 10-year mortgage four times in April, according to data from Walker & Dunlop. Freddie Mac\u2019s floating-rate loan cost 62 basis points more by the end of the month, the firm said. Fannie Mae similarly made its loans more expensive. Spreads on its 10-year mortgage increased a total of 45 basis points from late March to the end of April. Commercial mortgage lending is booming as demand for rental units fuels multifamily construction. Total lending surged 49 percent in the first quarter from last year, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Multifamily mortgages increased 71 percent in the same period. Lending at Walker & Dunlop exceeded analyst expectations in the first quarter, according to the firm\u2019s earnings report on Wednesday. It cited a wave of refinancings in commercial real estate as a big driver of the industry\u2019s growth. Walker drew 77 percent of its multifamily lending volume from Freddie and Fannie in the first quarter compared with 52 percent last year. \u201cEveryone in this market will do more this year,\u201d Jeffery Hayward, head of multifamily lending at Fannie Mae, said in an interview. FHFA\u2019s plan to ease loan restrictions comes five months after its director Mel Watt signaled to Congress that he would control the expansion of the two companies. They were seized by the government in 2008 as they neared insolvency. \u201cThe focus here is not to compete where there is adequate private sector coverage of the multifamily market,\u201d Watt told a House committee in January. CBRE Group Inc. said last week that the firm\u2019s multifamily lending backed by the agencies has been robust. CBRE Chief Financial Officer James Groch warned during the company\u2019s April earnings call that business could taper off toward the end of the year unless the caps are raised. \u201cAt the current pace they\u2019re likely to hit their caps before year end, which could slow things down toward the end of year unless the caps are increased,\u201d Groch said. A slowdown in multifamily agency mortgages would be a positive development for the private market, according to Lea Overby, an analyst at Nomura Holdings LLC. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac scoop up the best loans, and their expanded business has meant private buyers, primarily banks, are left picking over the leftovers, she said. \u201cI am excited about them hitting the cap because it means we\u2019ll have better quality CMBS,\u201d said Overby, referring to commercial mortgage backed securities. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae started increasing business last year in areas that are exempted from the caps: affordable and manufactured housing and small-balance loans. \u201cIt is a conscious strategy of ours to grow manufactured housing and small balance loans, in response to FHFA\u2019s scorecard,\u201d said David Brickman, executive vice president of multifamily business at Freddie Mac, adding that the firm plans to boost those categories of mortgages. Fannie Mae has similarly sought to maneuver around the volume limitations. \u201c\u2018Affordable\u2019 can be defined a bunch of ways,\u201d said Fannie Mae\u2019s Hayward. \u201cWe have done much more business this year because the market needs us to provide liquidity.\u201d","timestamp":1430913108.0,"participant_ids":["FNMA:US","FMCC:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-06\/fannie-freddie-regulator-said-to-plan-easing-some-limits","subject":"Fannie-Freddie Regulator Said to Plan Easing Some Limits"},{"body":"What does Manhattan\u2019s tallest residential tower have in common with the Hooters hotel-casino in Las Vegas? They\u2019re investments for rich families. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc are among banks presenting elite customers with offerings once confined to big institutional investors: access to real estate projects such as Manhattan\u2019s  , Las Vegas\u2019s Hooters hotel and $100 million Los Angeles mansions.\u00a0With the ranks of the rich growing, the perk gives wealthy clients a chance to benefit from soaring property values and step into marquee deals. \u201cIt\u2019s a way clients globally are gaining exposure to real estate in bite-sized chunks,\u201d said Paul Forshaw, London-based head of real estate fund management for HSBC Alternative Investments Ltd., which requires clients to put in at least $5 million for \u201cclub\u201d deals. \u201cOur clients have financial resources, absolutely,\u201d Forshaw said. \u201cBut it can still be difficult for people to enter the real estate market when they don\u2019t have a track record. That\u2019s where people like ourselves can help.\u201d While banks have long helped clients find property deals, the push into direct transactions for groups of wealthy people seeking high-profile investments has been relatively new. For JPMorgan and Citigroup it began about four years ago, as real estate started rebounding from the financial crisis, and demand is accelerating. Citi Private Bank offered five such deals to clients so far this year, compared with three in 2012. Typically, managers target internal rates of return in the mid-teens for the real estate investors, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the performance information is private. The banks are serving a growing class of ultra-rich customers who want alternatives to stocks and commodities for their portfolios. There are more than 17,160 families with at least $100 million in investable assets globally, up 27 percent since 2009, according to Boston Consulting Group. They\u2019re increasingly looking for direct investments rather than putting money in funds, seeking more transparency about what they own, lower fees and shorter terms on how long their money is locked up. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more interest in direct transactions from our international clients,\u201d said Robert Klein, global head of alternative investments at the private bank of New York-based JPMorgan. Clients from outside the U.S., including those from Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, typically contribute two-thirds or more of the capital raised in Citigroup\u2019s deals, said Daniel O\u2019Donnell, global head of private equity and real estate at the\u00a0company\u2019s private-bank unit. The minimum investment in Citigroup\u2019s real estate transactions usually is at least $250,000. The bank also has formed club deals where the threshold is usually more than $1 million. They\u2019re typically offered to a group of billionaire clients who seek similar types of real estate projects or locations, and participants usually have 30 days to opt in to a specific investment, O\u2019Donnell said. Among Citigroup\u2019s investments was providing equity for 432 Park Ave., the 1,396-foot (426-meter) tower where a penthouse is under contract for about $95 million. The private bank raised more than $400 million from clients for the building. It also is providing more than $200 million in   for the construction of a 60-story Boston tower that will be a hotel and condominium managed by Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts. Private-banking clients are usually more attracted to deals in major cities,\u00a0said William Fuhs Sr., the former chief executive officer of New York Private Bank & Trust, who now advises family offices on real estate investments. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting in Dubai and somebody says that you can acquire this shopping mall in Podunk versus taking a position in the tallest residential building in Manhattan, it doesn\u2019t matter what else they tell you about the Podunk place,\u201d said\u00a0Fuhs. \u201cIt\u2019s in New York and it\u2019s the tallest. It must be good.\u201d The deals carry potential risks such as escalating construction costs and sales of buildings taking longer than expected before investors see a profit. Commercial real estate prices in major U.S. cities also are more than 30 percent above their 2007 peak, making the investments less attractive as yields fall. \u201cEntering a market today brings a different bundle of risk and return than in 2010 or 2012,\u201d\u00a0said Jacques Gordon, global strategist for LaSalle Investment Management, which oversees real estate around the globe. \u201cYou should be able to get more rent growth but you are running closer and closer to the wind on pricing relative to bonds.\u201d Wealthy clients of HSBC have invested several billion dollars in real estate since 2009, Forshaw said. Demand has increased since then, but finding good opportunities at attractive prices has become harder because more global capital is seeking these types of assets, he said. About 18 months ago, HSBC invested in Dublin\u2019s Liffey Valley shopping center. Other transactions include a stake in the former Bertelsmann building at 1540 Broadway in New York and a partnership with\u00a0Houston-based developer Hines to buy the Broadgate Quarter offices in London. The deals offered to HSBC private-bank clients have been in commercial real estate as well as one in student housing. , part of JPMorgan\u2019s private bank, has invested about $600 million on behalf of clients since 2012. It teamed with Trinity Hotel Investors a few months ago to acquire the 696-room Hooters hotel-casino in Las Vegas. The purchase and renovation, which will include a rebranding, will cost more than $100 million, said John Fraser, Junius\u2019s managing partner. Junius also renovated and sold a package of 17 Marriott hotels and took a stake in the Salamander Resort & Spa, set on 340 acres (138 hectares) in Virginia\u2019s wine and horse country, outside Washington. It\u2019s now planning construction of 274 apartments in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District and recently unveiled\u00a0plans for The Park Bel Air, three   on a Los Angeles hillside with partner Domvs London. Buyers can have a more than 55,000-square-foot (5,100-square-meter) mansion built on one of the plots for a starting price of $115 million. In Europe, Societe Generale SA raised 31 million pounds ($48 million) from 40 private banking clients about 18 months ago to buy a London office building, and is now seeking other real estate opportunities on the continent, in particular in the Benelux countries, according to Eric Verleyen, the private bank\u2019s chief investment officer. The banks say they\u2019re selective about deals and while they\u2019re scouring for more, they aren\u2019t after volume. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to force-feed them deals through a fire hose,\u201d\u00a0said Citigroup\u2019s O\u2019Donnell. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find a handful of opportunities that add value for clients.\u201d","timestamp":1444716062.0,"participant_ids":["C:US","JPM:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-13\/how-banks-help-rich-clients-invest-in-vegas-hotels-nyc-towers","subject":"How Banks Help Rich Clients Invest in Vegas Hotel, NYC Tower"},{"body":" Studios of the Motion Picture Association of America Inc. said they sued a unit of Xunlei Ltd. in China over copyright infringement.

The film, based on the Walter Isaacson biography of Apple Inc.\u2019s co-founder, will make its debut in theaters on Oct. 9, according to a statement Wednesday by Universal, owned by Comcast Corp. The film, directed by Danny Boyle, will star Michael Fassbender as Jobs and Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, the former Macintosh marketing chief. It\u2019s set behind the scenes of three product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac, the studio said in a statement. Jobs died in 2011. Universal   the film from Sony Pictures in November, after disagreements over casting between producer Scott Rudin and Amy Pascal, the Sony Corp.-owned studio\u2019s co-chairman. The spat was revealed in e-mail exchanges leaked by hackers in November. Under Sony the biopic saw various changes in cast and crew. Originally David Fincher, who directed \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d had been linked to lead the Jobs biopic. Leonardo DiCaprio and Christian Bale had both been in talks for the role of Jobs before pulling out. The Culver City, California-based studio also considered Tom Cruise for the role, leaked e-mails revealed. The script for the Jobs picture is being written by Aaron Sorkin, who won an Oscar for writing the screenplay of \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d Fassbender is known for his roles in \u201cShame\u201d and featured in the Oscar-winning \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d Steve Wozniak, who co-founded Apple, is played by Seth Rogen. Sony grew disenchanted with \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d as projected costs rose and after DiCaprio dropped out, the e-mails show. Prior to giving up on the project last month, Sony Pictures had been working for three years on a film adaptation of Isaacson\u2019s 2011 biography. The timing of the film\u2019s release, combined with the involvement of several Oscar winners, makes it a potential awards contender. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious movie, and the fall traditionally is the time to release dramatic films that have awards potential,\u201d said Joe Pichirallo, chairman of undergraduate film and television at New York University.

The gap was made public by hackers who stole thousands of e-mails, spreadsheets and other internal documents in a cyber-attack on Sony Corp.\u2019s film studio last year. Female film executives at Sony also made less money than men. The episode led to calls for equal pay in Hollywood. Charlize Theron used it to negotiate a salary equal to that of her male co-star, Chris Hemsworth, for the 2016 Universal Pictures film \u201cThe Huntsman,\u201d The New York Post reported in January. \u201cAmerican Hustle,\u201d an Academy Award-nominated film, was released in 2013.

Kevin Feige, president of Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios, and Amy Pascal, the outgoing co-Chairman of Sony Pictures, will co-produce the next \u201cSpider-Man\u201d movie for release in July 2017, according to a statement from the Culver City, California-based unit of Sony on Monday. The superhero will appear earlier in an unnamed Marvel film, and the companies will look for ways to bring other Marvel characters into Spider-Man films. The deal ends the isolation of Spider-Man, one of Marvel\u2019s most important comic-book characters, which has been part of Sony\u2019s film lineup for more than a decade. Disney acquired Marvel in 2009 and, under Feige\u2019s supervision, has made several blockbusters weaving superheroes such as Iron Man, Thor and Captain America across its films. By bringing in Feige to help revive its most-valuable franchise, Sony gains Marvel\u2019s expertise plus tie-ins to other characters. \u201cThis is the right decision for the franchise, for our business, for Marvel, and for the fans,\u201d\u00a0Michael Lynton, chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said in the statement.

Sony plans two other films based on comic-book enemies of Spider-Man, according to Imdb.com. \u201cSinister Six\u201d is due out in November 2016. There is no date listed for \u201cVenom.\u201d Bringing Spider-Man into the Marvel cinematic universe \u201copens up fantastic new opportunities for storytelling and franchise building,\u201d Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Burbank, California-based Disney, said in a statement. Sony had success with three \u201cSpider-Man\u201d films starring Tobey Maguire from 2002 to 2007. The studio then brought in Andrew Garfield, whose most recent effort, \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man 2,\u201d generated $202.9 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales -- about half of the 2002 original -- and $709 million at the global box office. By comparison, the most recent \u201cIron Man 3\u201d in 2013 produced $1.22 billion in global sales for Disney and Marvel. Marvel has 11 films scheduled for   between 2015 and 2019, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. They include a sequel to \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d and new films based on the characters \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cCaptain Marvel.\u201d The studio last summer stepped up the number of films it was making as Marvel faced new competition from Time Warner Inc.\u2019s DC Comics, home of Batman and Superman.

The mortgage company underwrote $21.2 billion of debt on apartment buildings in the second half of 2014, triple the total in the first six months. The surge meant the McLean, Virginia-based lender almost surpassed the larger Fannie Mae last year to become the biggest provider of U.S. apartment financing, following changes by the agency that oversees both companies. Melvin L. Watt, who took over as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, is rolling back policies aimed at shrinking the government-controlled finance companies, letting Freddie Mac push into segments of multifamily lending that had been off limits. That\u2019s helping bolster demand for apartment buildings, already the hottest part of the commercial real estate market, as values rise to a point of possible overinflation. \u201cRents have been growing at a significantly faster clip than wages,\u201d said Sam Chandan, president of Chandan Economics. \u201cThe outlook for rental growth is more measured than what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years.\u201d Apartment values have been rising steadily since 2010, according to the indexes compiled by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Real Capital Analytics Inc. Multifamily buildings in large cities such as New York and San Francisco have had the biggest gains in the real estate recovery, with prices 40 percent higher than the record reached in November 2007, during the last boom. Those higher values will be tested when the central bank raises interest rates, a more likely prospect in 2015 after a strong jobs report this month. While prices for the best apartment buildings in the highest-demand markets may be due for a correction, there\u2019s still room for growth among properties outside the top tier, said David Brickman, head of multifamily operations at Freddie Mac. \u201cNobody is building Class B properties,\u201d Brickman said in a phone interview. \u201cVacancies continue to be very low.\u201d Both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae boosted apartment lending during the latter half of 2014 after Watt eased restrictions on that part of their businesses, according to real estate research firm Green Street Advisors LLC. The FHFA capped their multifamily lending at $30 billion each this year -- a $4 billion increase for Freddie Mac -- after telling the companies to shrink the business in 2013. Watt succeeded Edward DeMarco, who made cutting the size of the companies a priority while he was director, a role he assumed when the FHFA was created in July 2008. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were seized and taken into U.S. conservatorship in September 2008 as the companies buckled under the weight of souring home loans, requiring a $187.5 billion taxpayer bailout. The surge in volume at the end of last year was due in large part to an unexpected drop in interest rates that pulled some borrowers off the sidelines, according to Jeff Hayward, head of multifamily operations at Fannie Mae. The demand for loans was sluggish at the start of the year, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac didn\u2019t have a clear mandate from their regulator until May, according to Willy Walker, chief executive officer of Walker & Dunlop Inc. The new FHFA road map allows the lenders to exceed volume caps to serve affordable-housing needs, Walker said. \u201cThat was really a great shot in the arm,\u201d said Walker, whose company is a lender in the multifamily programs at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which rely on partnerships with banks and other financial institutions to acquire loans. The shift in tone at the FHFA has been especially beneficial for Class B buildings, properties that are typically at least 20 years old and may need upgrades, Green Street analysts led by Dave Bragg wrote in a report last month. Ownership of such buildings varies widely, ranging from individuals to large institutions, according to Bragg. Freddie Mac last year started a program catering to borrowers renovating their properties, Brickman said. The short-term loans are designed to facilitate improvements prior to investors taking on longer-term debt. New FHFA rules last year also enabled Freddie Mac to   manufactured-housing communities and form a group dedicated to originating small apartment  , of $1 million to $5 million. The average size of a Freddie Mac multifamily mortgage is $15 million, and loans can be as large as $450 million. A $4 million loan to refinance debt on Nettleton Commons, a complex in Syracuse, New York, completed last month, is typical of the program. Fannie Mae has been doing such lending, geared toward providing low-income housing, for several years. Fannie Mae is losing ground as Freddie Mac expands its programs and offers borrowers more generous terms, such as allowing landlords to defer paying off principal. Freddie Mac\u2019s multifamily-loan volume exceeded Fannie Mae\u2019s by more than $2 billion in the fourth quarter. For all of 2014, Fannie Mae retained a slim lead, completing $28.9 billion in apartment financing, compared with Freddie Mac\u2019s $28.3 billion. Combined, the two hold about $334 billion of outstanding multifamily debt, with Fannie Mae accounting for $198.4 billion as of Sept. 30. By contrast, the companies hold more than $4 trillion of loans backed by homes occupied by their owners. In their multifamily units, the two use different models to distribute the risk of borrowers defaulting. Fannie Mae shares in losses with the lenders it partners with, while Freddie Mac offloads losses to private investors. Fannie Mae\u2019s model leads to a more conservative approach to underwriting. The larger lender isn\u2019t standing still. At the end of last year, Fannie Mae started funding borrowers with newly constructed properties that are still in the process of finding tenants for them. While buildings typically have to be least 90 percent occupied to qualify for funding from Fannie Mae, the new program allows for vacancy rates as high as 25 percent, said Hilary Provinse, a senior vice president at the company. More than six years of near-zero interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve have pushed all types of investors to take on more risk to generate higher returns. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have to get more aggressive to compete, and Freddie has been faster than Fannie to adapt, said Walker of Walker & Dunlop. Still, the landscape remains relatively tame compared with the excess of the years leading up to the last property-market crash, Walker said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing loans with either agency that say the silly underwriting of 2006 and 2007 is coming back,\u201d he said. The multifamily units at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been growing steadily since 1994, emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed, compared with the arms that deal with individual homeowners. The companies\u2019 track record in the industry supports their continued growth, according to Bragg of Green Street. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily think we\u2019re taking on more risk,\u201d said Brickman of Freddie Mac. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling more empowered to make good loans and not as concerned about staying in a lane.\u201d (An earlier version of this story corrected the time frame of new $30 billion loan caps for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.)","timestamp":1423720800.0,"participant_ids":["FMCC:US","FNMA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-12\/freddie-mac-catching-up-in-apartment-boom-mortgages","subject":"Freddie Mac Catching Up in Apartment Boom: Mortgages"},{"body":" Sony Pictures is blocking reviews of \u201cAloha\u201d until just a few hours before moviegoers can see it Thursday. But one\u2019s already in, from the studio\u2019s recently departed chairman. She called it \u201cridiculous.\u201d Amy Pascal, forced out after a cyberattack on Sony computers revealed racist jokes she made in e-mails about President Barack Obama\u2019s taste in films, wrote colleagues in November that the Cameron Crowe feature \u201cmakes no sense\u201d and \u201cnever, not even once, ever works.\u201d That could explain the muted marketing campaign for \u201cAloha,\u201d starring Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone, and the lack of glitzy red-carpet premieres. Phil Contrino, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, said the signature evidence of Sony\u2019s desire to curb exposure to any it\u2019s-a-bomb fallout is the restriction on when reviews can be posted. Critics always agree to limits, but they\u2019re usually lifted days before a movie opens. \u201cTo embargo reviews to the night before the film is not usually a good sign,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the studio has confidence in a film, they will be happy to have critics comment on it.\u201d \u201cAloha\u201d -- about a defense contractor in Hawaii who falls for an Air Force pilot -- cost almost $40 million to make. It opens in wide release Friday and is expected to collect $14 million over the weekend and between $30 million and $35 million during its run in theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to Boxoffice.com. That ticket revenue is split with exhibitors. Possibly more distressing for Sony than having a dud is that \u201cevery time a film comes out that was in the e-mails, that will mean people will talk about the hack again,\u201d said Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University\u2019s Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture. The leaks from the 2014 cyberattack that the FBI linked to North Korea -- which may have been insulted by the Sony comedy \u201cThe Interview\u201d that depicted the assassination of dictator Kim Jong-un -- offered rare insight into the workings of a Hollywood studio and exposed often embarrassing exchanges between Pascal and others. She left the studio in February, after 12 years as its head, and is now an independent producer on the Sony lot. Simon Halls, a spokesman for Pascal, declined to comment. Crowe also declined to comment. Tom Rothman, Pascal\u2019s successor, said the studio is \u201cvery proud of the film\u201d and called Crowe \u201cone of the great writer-directors of our generation and a master of the smart romantic comedy, which seems to be a lost genre these days. \u2018Aloha\u2019 is rich in his signature humanism.\u201d Probably best known for 1996\u2019s \u201cJerry Maguire,\u201d Crowe wrote and directed \u201cAloha\u201d and produced it with Scott Rudin. At a media screening in Los Angeles Tuesday, Crowe made a brief appearance on stage, drawing laughs when he said he realized some private conversations about the movie had become public. He called it a \u201clove letter to Hawaii.\u201d It had briefly been considered for release in December, the month the hacked e-mails were made public. After Pascal\u2019s harsh internal   of the film was dispatched, some scenes were reshot, according to a person familiar with the situation. Sony touted \u201cAloha\u201d with theatrical trailers and billboards. The studio spent almost $20 million on marketing, according to the person. Publicity was limited because Cooper\u2019s in London in the play \u201cThe Elephant Man\u201d and Stone has been in France promoting a Woody Allen film, the person said. The studio wanted to distance Crowe from another round of headlines about the hacked e-emails, according to the person, who said that was a reason Sony put the late embargo on reviews. The next hack-exposed movie once in Sony\u2019s lineup is about Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, based on the biography by Walter Isaacson. Sony decided to back out of it last year after cost projections escalated and Leonardo DiCaprio and Christian Bale passed on playing Jobs. That led to heated exchanges between Pascal and Rudin, according to documents released by the hackers, who called themselves Guardians of Peace. At one point, Rudin tried to hire director David Fincher for the Jobs film, which put him at odds with Angelina Jolie and her aim to make a new Cleopatra movie with Fincher, the e-mails show. Rudin dismissed the Jolie project as an \u201cego bath\u201d and called her \u201ca minimally talented spoiled brat.\u201d Universal Pictures acquired the Jobs movie, with a script co-written by Oscar-winner Aaron Sorkin. Before the film left Sony, he and Pascal discussed candidates for the lead, and he rebelled when she suggested Michael Fassbender, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his role as a plantation owner in \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d in 2013. \u201cI don\u2019t know who Michael Fassbender is and the rest of the world isn\u2019t going to care,\u201d Sorkin wrote in an e-mail released by the hackers, though in another he said, \u201cF-ck it. He\u2019s a great actor whose time has come.\u201d \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d opens Oct. 9, starring Fassbender.","timestamp":1432775701.0,"participant_ids":["6758:JP","1356954Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-28\/sony-pictures-film-panned-by-sony-pictures-long-before-its-debut","subject":"Sony Pictures Has Already Panned Its\u00a0Own Movie"},{"body":"One might think that an auto parts company whose main product is at the center of a 19-million-vehicle recall involving a dozen carmakers would have its hands full. But Takata, the Japanese maker of air bags that killed nine motorists and injured about 100 more, is turning toward the burgeoning field of driverless cars\u2014a market that may be worth $42\u00a0billion annually by 2025, estimates Boston Consulting\u00a0Group. Autonomous vehicles pose a threat to Takata and other auto safety suppliers because such cars could eventually render steering wheels obsolete, and sharply decreasing crashes would undermine the need for seat belts and air bags. Those three products account for 86\u00a0percent of Takata\u2019s sales. Nevertheless, says Kirk Morris, vice president for engineering, Takata has signed up automakers to buy its safety products for autonomous cars starting late this year. \u201cThe whole industry is trying to grapple with how to keep their chips in the game and a seat at the table,\u201d says Scott Upham, founder of Valient Market Research. \u201cTakata is trying to take their core capabilities and plug them into the new reality, which is autonomous driving.\u201d Takata\u2019s development of autonomous driving systems started years ago and hasn\u2019t been affected by the air\u00a0bag crisis, Morris says. \u201cThese technologies will be necessary in every semiautonomous or autonomous vehicle,\u201d he says. \u201cInnovation drives our business. We want to continue being an innovator.\u201d In private sessions with customers at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Takata demonstrated a monitoring system that uses a camera and special lights to track the gaze and head movement of a person behind the wheel. Carmakers want such systems to ensure that drivers\u2014still required by current law to have their hands on the wheel of a sensor-controlled vehicle\u2014pay attention and can retake control of an autonomous car if needed, Morris says. \u201cThe holy grail is fully autonomous, and then there are steps where the driver is still in the loop,\u201d says Jason Lisseman, a Takata engineering director. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep the driver in the loop.\u201d One Takata product is an LED bar embedded in the top of the steering wheel, which could warn the driver of a potential collision or communicate when it\u2019s OK to let go of or retake the wheel from the autonomous system. Another sensor system can detect whether the driver is touching the steering wheel. One automaker has a contract with Takata to put the camera-based monitoring system into production next year in about 10,000 vehicles, says Morris, who declined to name the customer. The cost of the system to manufacturers, which could range from about $100 to $400 per vehicle, will drop as production increases. Several carmakers will use the steering wheel sensor system beginning in late 2016, with a total volume of about 60,000 vehicles in the first year, he says. The light bar\u2019s debut is scheduled for 2017. Still, the air bag failures could stall the driverless-gear push. \u201cIt may be difficult for Takata to win orders from carmakers for new-model parts in bidding after losing their trust,\u201d says Takahiro Kusakari, a fund manager at Sawakami Asset Management, once one of Takata\u2019s biggest shareholders. And Takata, which recently cut its annual profit forecast by 75\u00a0percent for the fiscal year ending in April, says it\u2019s still unable to estimate its full recall costs. \u201cTakata will have to pay one-time losses from their operating profit, pay the cost for the class-action lawsuits, and then it may not have much for research and development,\u201d Kusakari says. \u201cSo after this turmoil is gone, Takata\u2019s products may not be competitive anymore and behind the other technologies.\u201d","timestamp":1452184078.0,"participant_ids":["7312:JP","TAKATZ:CH"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-01-07\/takata-looks-way-past-its-air-bag-woes","subject":"Takata Looks Way Past Its Air Bag Woes"},{"body":" Qihoo 360 Technology Co. rose to the highest since November, leading a rally in U.S.-traded Chinese stocks as an $8.2 billion buyout offer from its top executive fueled speculation that other deals are in the works.

Trading volume of 13.5 million shares was more than 4 times the daily average of the past three months. The stock contributed the most to a 1.6 percent gain in the Bloomberg China-US Index as Xunlei Ltd. and SouFun Holdings Ltd., which some analysts have identified as   targets, each rallied at least 9 percent. An investor group led by Hongyi Zhou, Qihoo\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, proposed to pay $77 per American depositary receipt to buy all the outstanding stock, a 17 percent premium over Tuesday\u2019s closing price.

Higher policy rates in the U.S., a pickup in inflation and economic growth will propel yields higher in 2016, Garzarelli said.

The cost to insure Sharp\u2019s debt against non-payment jumped 150 basis points last week to 475 basis points, after the Nikkei newspaper and Kyodo News said it will report a loss this fiscal year. The Osaka-based company narrowly avoided collapse in 2012. Sony\u2019s credit-default swaps declined to 105, according to data provider CMA. The average cost for Asian technology companies was 111. Sony expects revenue from the PlayStation and network businesses to climb 24 percent over the next three years, while new Spider-Man movies and content based on video games drive sales growth of as much as 36 percent at its pictures units. Sharp said last week it may miss its annual earnings target, citing currency moves and competition in the flat panel business. \u201cWhen the company is in the midst of restructuring, flipping from a profit forecast to a loss is quite a blow,\u201d said Mana Nakazora, the chief credit analyst for Japan at BNP Paribas SA. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a disappointment and suddenly changes the perception that Sharp is ahead of Sony in reforming itself.\u201d Sharp was forecasting a net income of 30 billion yen ($255 million) in the year to March 31, its biggest profit in seven years. President Kozo Takahashi cut 167 billion yen in   and focused on smaller screens for Chinese smartphone brands to end losses last fiscal period. Competition from those same handset makers prompted Sony to take a 180 billion-yen   on its Xperia business. The company is ending development of new models for China, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market, and focusing its marketing on retaining customers. \u201cWhen you narrow your business scope to just your core competencies like Sharp did, you expose yourself to risks of over-concentration,\u201d said Yasuhiro Matsumoto, a senior manager in Tokyo at Abeam Consulting Ltd. \u201cThe market values the depth of Sony\u2019s business line.\u201d A restructuring push by Sony Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida has seen the company sell off its Vaio personal computer brand and put its TV manufacturing unit into a new structure. The maker of PlayStation consoles expects the game franchise, financial services division, image sensor business and film content to power earnings. Sharp\u2019s default swaps jumped to 7,648 basis points more than Sony\u2019s in October 2012 after the maker of Aquos televisions said there are uncertainties about it being an \u201cassumed going concern.\u201d Its surprise loss forecast in August of that year sparked ratings downgrades that made it difficult to raise money, pushing the manufacturer to the verge of default. Sharp is still Japan\u2019s riskiest company, even after removing the reference to doubts about staying \u201ca going concern\u201d last year. Sony spokesman George Boyd and Sharp spokeswoman Miyuki Nakayama both declined to comment on the bond risk moves.

Sony enlisted Ernst & Young to look into its businesses in the country and uncovered potential evidence of wrongdoing, according to the e-mails. In one case, investigators found that a joint venture between Sony and Discovery Communications Inc. may have engaged in fraudulent bids, kickbacks and excessive handouts to government officials, according to an October memo sent to the chief financial officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment. The messages didn\u2019t mention whether the investigations had ended or what the results were. The probes, which haven\u2019t been reported on before, put a spotlight on business practices at one of Sony\u2019s key markets. The company generates more revenue from TV programming in India, with an audience   the size of the U.S. population, than in any other market, largely thanks to its rights to broadcast Indian Premier League cricket. Representatives at Sony Pictures Entertainment in California and the parent company in Tokyo didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, including from officials mentioned in the e-mails. Representatives of Ernst & Young didn\u2019t return calls. It\u2019s unclear whether the venture between Sony\u2019s Multi-Screen Media Pvt. and Discovery still exists. The general number listed on the venture\u2019s website is no longer in use. Representatives at Sony didn\u2019t respond to queries about a Business Standard   in November that MSM Discovery would be dissolved by Jan. 1. Karuna Gulyani, an India-based spokeswoman at Discovery, declined to comment, as did officials at MSM\u2019s Mumbai office. Sony gained 5.5 percent to 2,598 yen as of the close in Tokyo trading. The stock rose amid expectations that the company\u2019s earnings will improve next fiscal year, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. In the e-mail from early October, sent by Cindy Salmen, senior vice-president and compliance counsel, Sony Pictures Entertainment\u2019s financial compliance division outlined four \u201careas of concern\u201d at the MSM Discovery Indian venture. The memo recommended further investigations be conducted, employees be re-trained and that some workers face disciplinary actions, including termination. As a distributor, MSM Discovery buys programming and sells it to broadcasters. In the competitive bid fraud allegations, a review of practices at MSM Discovery\u2019s marketing group pointed to instances where losing vendors either didn\u2019t exist or were tied to the winning vendor, and that some employees were aware of the practice, according to the one-page memo entitled \u201cMSM Discovery Talking Points.\u201d In the probe into alleged kickbacks involving carriage fees, which are   made by a broadcaster to a distributor, Ernst & Young said it received allegations that MSM and MSM Discovery were receiving kickbacks ranging from 10 percent to 15 percent of the fees, according to the memo. Additionally, some employees who were fired for carriage-fee kickbacks at another company were employed at MSM Discovery, according to the memo. A third investigation looked into potential gifts and entertainment of Indian government officials that exceeded MSM Discovery policy limits. The memo cited evidence of employees providing tickets to IPL cricket matches to public servants, as well as laptop bags that were requested as gifts for government officials during the Diwali festival. IPL tickets can cost as much as 25,000 rupees ($405) each,   to its website. A fourth probe found communications that raised questions about certain payments to Indian customs by MSM Discovery\u2019s marketing group, according to the memo, which didn\u2019t provide further details on those allegations. In India, Sony\u2019s entertainment business mainly consists of distributing Hollywood films and operating sports and entertainment channels such as AXN and Animax. Its assets include broadcast rights for IPL cricket, which American Appraisal   to be worth about $3.2 billion. Sony also sells consumer electronics, including its Bravia brand TVs, there. India is the largest market in Sony\u2019s media networks division, accounting for 37 percent of the $1.6 billion the business generated worldwide last fiscal year, according to the  . E-mails show that in late September, Raymond Smith, Sony Pictures senior vice president for global investigative and forensic services, recommended that a full investigation of MSM Discovery be conducted for alleged policy violations. Smith wrote that he and Mike Ornelas, executive director for global investigative and forensic services, would travel to India for two weeks in mid-October to investigate allegations of carriage-fee kickbacks and competitive bid issues at MSM Discovery. In the e-mail, Smith wrote that it would take Ernst & Young four to six weeks to investigate the allegations at an estimated cost of $176,000. A separate probe was triggered after a person claiming to be an MSM employee sent an anonymous letter to Andrew Kaplan, president for worldwide networks at Sony Pictures Television, and Man Jit Singh, president for Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, alleging \u201clarge scale corruption\u201d at MSM. The Oct. 6 letter alleged that the head of MSM\u2019s motion-pictures unit was colluding with an agent to raise the cost of movies that Sony bought to air on TV by as much as 35 percent in return for kickbacks. According to the letter, Sneha Rajani, a deputy president at MSM, was routing the company\u2019s movie purchases through Manish Shah of Goldmines Telefilms, raising prices of the films. According to the letter, Rajani also instructed producers, who offered to sell their films to MSM, to direct their proposals to Shah. A representative at Goldmines declined to make Shah available for comment. Attempts to reach Rajani, who still lists MSM as her employer based on her Twitter feed and LinkedIn page, failed. The Sony e-mails were released as part of a cyber-attack on Sony\u2019s entertainment unit last year that exposed Hollywood secrets, destroyed company data and caused the movie studio to initially cancel the release of a comedy about a fictional assassination of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un. The FBI said North Korea is behind the attack, which rendered thousands of computers inoperable and forced Sony Pictures to take its entire network offline. Sony wouldn\u2019t be the only global company to deal with allegations of malfeasance in India, a country ranked   out of 175 in Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index. In 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission   Oracle Corp. failed to prevent a subsidiary from secretly setting aside money off the company\u2019s books that was used to make unauthorized payments to phony vendors in India, resulting in Oracle agreeing to pay a $2 million settlement without admitting or denying the allegations. India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation said last year it began probing officials at Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc in connection with alleged bribery in the supply of spare parts for helicopter engines. Representatives at Rolls-Royce, which has said it\u2019s cooperating with authorities, weren\u2019t immediately available to comment on the status of that probe.","timestamp":1421787901.0,"participant_ids":["9891003Z:US","DISCA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-20\/sony-probed-india-business-for-corruption-e-mails-show","subject":"Sony Probed India Business for Corruption, E-Mails Show"},{"body":" Investors are scrutinizing Chinese developers\u2019 books after Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd.\u2019s default, as rating companies highlight accounting red flags. A doubling of Kaisa\u2019s debt only came to light after a potential buyer reviewed its accounts and customers sought refunds on deposits for buying properties without presale clearance. Advance payments, bookkeeping for joint ventures and perpetual bonds are among areas needing attention to assess risks, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service said. \u201cInvestors are taking a closer look at the small print because they have begun to think Kaisa may not be the only one,\u201d said Ben Sy, head of fixed income, foreign exchange and commodities for Asia at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s private banking division. \u201cThe accounting issues surrounding Chinese developers have always been there, but the Kaisa default has increased worries about the contingent and unreported debt.\u201d The accurate assessment of China\u2019s corporate debt, which S&P says was the highest in the world at $14.2 trillion at the end of 2013, has taken on new urgency as Premier Li Keqiang allows more delinquencies while trying to prevent contagion. The use of off-balance sheet vehicles and structured finance tools has prompted billionaire investor George Soros to note \u201ceerie resemblances\u201d between China and the U.S. in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. Debt at China\u2019s developers has ballooned since 2008, when the crisis prompted the government to unveil 4 trillion yuan ($645 billion) of stimulus that sparked a wave of building. During the boom, speculators using less-transparent shadow financing built an excess of housing in some places. Researcher SouFun Holdings Ltd. says the nation has more than 10 \u201cghost cities\u201d haunted by empty apartment blocks. Seeking to rein in the excesses, policy makers began enacting curbs on real estate financing from 2010, including limits on onshore loans, bonds and funding from shadow banks. While authorities have since eased some of the rules, homebuilders still face higher hurdles to access credit. \u201cWith the tightening in credit, financial ratios such as debt to equity and interest cover have become crucial to obtain financing,\u201d said Liu Xuong, a Shanghai-based managing director at the transaction advisory group of Alvarez & Marsal. \u201cSo if there is a way to improve the ratios, they would do that.\u201d One method property companies have used that complies with the country\u2019s accounting rules involves joint ventures, which they needn\u2019t always consolidate onto their balance sheets. \u201cMany developers are using JVs to build out their portfolio without inflating their debt,\u201d said Chris Yip, director, corporate ratings at S&P. \u201cSo we adjust for debt guaranteed by Chinese developers\u2019 from joint ventures.\u201d Moody\u2019s also makes such adjustments, said Franco Leung, a senior analyst in Hong Kong. Sunac China Holdings Ltd. is a prime example of the joint-venture trend, according to Leung and S&P\u2019s Yip. Moody\u2019s estimates Sunac\u2019s adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio after factoring in joint-venture debt was 67 percent as at the end of 2014, compared with 59 percent without such obligations added. Liu Qiang, an investor relations official at Sunac, confirmed the adjusted figure by phone on May 13. He declined to comment further on the joint-venture accounting. Sunac\u2019s 12.5 percent bonds due 2017 are little changed in the past year at about 107 cents, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. Its shares have jumped 142 percent. \u201cThe presence of a significant number of joint ventures could be at times opaque from a disclosure standpoint,\u201d said Swee Ching Lim, a credit analyst at Western Asset Management Co., which managed $455 billion of assets as of March 31. \u201cThis certainly adds another layer of complexity.\u201d Perpetual securities also help companies cut debt ratios, as international standards allow the proceeds to be counted as equity. While the notes have no set maturity, their coupons can rise if the company doesn\u2019t pay them off by defined dates. Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd., the third-largest Chinese developer by assets, has the most perpetuals among rated developers with 52.85 billion yuan at the end of 2014, according to Moody\u2019s Leung. Its revenue-to-debt ratio was 53.3 percent after treating perpetual securities as debt, compared with 71.4 percent before the adjustment, he said. John Peng, assistant chief financial officer at Evergrande, said its perpetuals accounting complies with standards in Hong Kong, where it is listed. Evergrande\u2019s 8.75 percent notes due 2018 have advanced 1 cent in the past year to 91 cents. Its shares leapt 101 percent. Perpetuals often carry rules saying any nonpayment on other obligations would force the issuer to repay the securities, according to Andrew Lam, a Hong Kong-based director at BDO Ltd. \u201cAlthough it sits nicely as equity during normal times, it can hurt as a double whammy by reducing equity and increasing debt if a company defaults,\u201d Lam said. Kaisa\u2019s debt more than doubled to 65 billion yuan at the end of 2014 from six months earlier, which it explained in statements as related to requests from independent third parties for a \u201crefund of their deposits with interest.\u201d It said trust financing and other borrowings also contributed. BDO and Lucror Analytics analysts said the advance deposits had characteristics of interest-bearing debt and booking them under current liabilities may have hidden credit risks. Calls to the mobile phone of Frank Chen, a Kaisa investor relations official, went unanswered Friday. There was no immediate reply to an e-mail seeking comment. Current liabilities at China\u2019s 100 biggest listed developers have ballooned to the equivalent of $497 billion from $107 billion at the end of 2009, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Debt jumped to 169 percent of equity from 96 percent. \u201cChinese property developers might have been short-sighted and tried to increase their valuation by using some creative accounting methods,\u201d said Emir Hrnjic, director of education at the National University of Singapore Business School\u2019s Centre for Asset Management Research and Investments. \u201cIn the long-run, the debt problem will surface.\u201d","timestamp":1431867601.0,"participant_ids":["1638:HK","JPM:US","MCO:US","1918:HK"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-17\/kaisa-debt-dispute-spurs-closer-look-at-china-developers-books","subject":"JPMorgan Checks Fine Print as Kaisa Default Alerts S&P on China"},{"body":" Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. awarded Chief Executive Officer Jon Feltheimer a grant of 600,000 stock options following a share swap that put billionaire John Malone on the film-production company\u2019s board.

The proposal equates to about 73 cents on the dollar in net present value terms for Kaisa\u2019s dollar bonds, compared with the developer\u2019s initial offer that Bank of America Corp. had said equated to between  . The revised plan is based on an acceptable annual return on investment for Kaisa\u2019s notes of about 15 percent, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. Kaisa, based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, is seeking to restructure some $10.5 billion of interest-bearing debt amid a takeover bid by rival property developer Sunac that could be valued at as much as $1.2 billion. Sunac   in its shares in Hong Kong earlier today pending an announcement about the proposed acquisition. Neil McDonald, a lawyer at Kirkland & Ellis LLP, the law firm advising the offshore bondholder committee, said he couldn\u2019t comment. Tianjin-based Sunac agreed in February to buy a 49 percent stake in cash-strapped Kaisa and to make a general offer for the rest of the company. The deal has been complicated by a delay in Kaisa\u2019s financial results and the return of its Chairman Kwok Ying Shing. Kwok resigned from Kaisa on Dec. 31, citing health reasons, only to return to the helm on April 13. Seven days later the company defaulted on two of its dollar bonds. Kwok told offshore bondholders earlier this month he may offer them a   restructuring proposal than the one Sunac has made, raising questions about his intention to sell the company, other people familiar with the matter said. The revised 73-cent offer, reported by Debtwire earlier, shows \u201cSunac is still determined to get the Kaisa deal done,\u201d according to Rui Guo, a credit analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (HK) Ltd. Sunac \u201csees the Kaisa acquisition as a relatively low cost way to acquire good quality assets in Tier 1 cities in the Pearl River Delta,\u201d he wrote in a research note today. Kaisa\u2019s $800 million of 8.875 percent 2018 bonds, sold at par or 100 cents on the dollar in March 2013, jumped 2.4 cents to 67.018 cents, the highest in a month, as of 3:55 p.m. in Hong Kong. Its $250 million of 12.875 percent 2017 notes also increased 2.4 cents, the most in two weeks, to 67.441 cents, prices compiled by Bloomberg show. Sunac shares closed 0.8 percent lower at HK$10 on Thursday, before they were suspended. Stock in Kaisa has been suspended from trade since March 31. Prudence Investment Management Ltd. was among the funds that didn\u2019t agree to the revised offer, the people familiar with the matter said today. Officials at the money manager couldn\u2019t immediately comment when reached by phone. There are now eight money managers in Kaisa\u2019s offshore bondholder committee after Highbridge Capital Management (HK) Ltd. resigned from what was a nine-member steering group, other people familiar said today. The eight are Ashmore Investment Management Pte, BFAM Partners Hong Kong Ltd., CQS (HK) Ltd., Citic Securities International Co., Claren Road Asset Management LLC, Harvest Global Investments Ltd., Prudence Investment Management and Value Partners Ltd. Sunac has sought permission from Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange to proceed with its acquisition of a stake in Kaisa even though Kaisa hasn\u2019t published audited results for 2014, people with knowledge of the matter said on April 30. If the exchange grants the waiver, it would pave the way for Sunac to complete the purchase before the expiration date of July 31. Kwok said on May 5 he\u2019s considering a few alternatives regarding what to do with the company, but couldn\u2019t reveal them until after the expiry date.

A disposal of T-Mobile Netherlands may fetch seven to eight times the target\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,\u00a0said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. That means the business could be valued at as much as 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion), based on 2014 numbers. The asset could attract interest from companies including John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global Plc as well as private-equity firms, they said. Deutsche Telekom is working with Credit Suisse Group AG on the process, which is at a preliminary stage, the people said. No final decision has been made and Deutsche Telekom could still decide against a sale, they said. The shares rose as much as 4.3 percent in the final minute of trading Tuesday in Frankfurt. They added 0.4 percent to 15.74 euros at 9:10 a.m. local time, valuing Europe\u2019s largest phone company at 72 billion euros. Liberty Global fell 0.9 percent to $45.39 in New York on Tuesday. Representatives for Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom, Zurich-based Credit Suisse and London-based Liberty Global declined to comment. Competition in the Dutch market of 17 million people has intensified recently, with former phone monopoly Royal KPN NV and the local units of Vodafone Group Plc, Deutsche Telekom and\u00a0Tele2 AB all upgrading their networks to improve coverage. Cable provider Ziggo, which was acquired last year by Liberty Global, also offers wireless services by leasing capacity from Vodafone. With about 3.7 million customers, Deutsche Telekom is the third-largest mobile operator in the Netherlands. It has a market share of 18.2 percent, behind KPN with 52 percent and Vodafone with 25.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There\u2019s a \"strong logic\" for Deutsche Telekom to consider a sale because of its loss of mobile market share, lack of convergent assets and a rising threat from Tele2, according to Erhan Gurses, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Liberty Global is a realistic buyer because of its nationwide cable network, he said. Any deal would have to be approved by regulators. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager this month launched an in-depth probe into Liberty Global\u2019s bid for KPN NV\u2019s Belgian mobile-phone business, citing competition issues. However, Liberty Global wouldn\u2019t face the same scrutiny in the Netherlands,\u00a0because unlike in Belgium, the company doesn\u2019t have a significant mobile presence in the country, Gurses said. Last year, T-Mobile Netherlands reported Ebitda of 630 million euros on sales of 1.55 billion euros. The country accounted for 2.5 percent of the group\u2019s revenue, as Deutsche Telekom generates more than two thirds of its sales in Germany and the U.S. Deutsche Telekom entered the Dutch mobile-phone market in 2000, acquiring a stake in a venture with\u00a0Belgacom SA and\u00a0Tele Danmark.

His Liberty Global Plc is in talks to buy Cable & Wireless Communications Plc in a potential cash-and-stock deal that would expand its reach to the Caribbean and Panama. A purchase could be announced in the next few weeks and Liberty Global may consider spinning off its Latin America unit in the future, people familiar with the plan said. Cable & Wireless is seeking more than $5.5 billion, said one of the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. \u201cHe\u2019s going to create another oligopoly in Latin America, after doing this in the U.S. and then in Europe,\u201d said Neil Campling, a media analyst at Aviate Global in London.\u00a0 Malone telegraphed his intentions to get bigger in the region in July, when Liberty Global created a tracking stock called LiLAC for its existing assets in Latin America and the Caribbean. The move gives Malone a new balance sheet from which to start consolidating local assets, Campling said. Liberty Global and Cable & Wireless representatives declined to comment on price or timing for any deal. The news of a potential deal with Cable & Wireless may also extinguish any last hopes Liberty Global would find common ground for a combination of sorts with Vodafone Group Plc, after the two sides ended their own talks last month. While Malone had maintained Vodafone\u2019s assets in Europe would be attractive, he said the two companies have different corporate cultures that would make a combination difficult. Thursday\u2019s announcement that Liberty Global found another suitor sent Vodafone shares lower Thursday, paring the day\u2019s gains to 3.4 percent from a high of 4.3 percent. The stock added 1.6 percent at 11:46 a.m. in London. Cable & Wireless, in which Malone became a big   a year ago, advanced as much as 9.9 percent Friday after rising 21 percent in the final minutes of London trading Thursday, giving it a market value of about 3.4 billion pounds ($5.2 billion). Liberty Global fell 1.7 percent to $43.50 in New York Thursday. Malone, 74, has taken on mountains of debt in recent years to expand European operations as a plunge in interest rates allowed Liberty Global to borrow cheaply. Liberty Global has spent more than   consolidating cable operations on the continent and with Vodafone now potentially out of the picture, analysts predict he will focus on content assets in Europe, such as U.K. television broadcaster and producer ITV Plc, in which Liberty Global owns 9.9 percent. In the meantime, Malone can build up Liberty Global\u2019s business in the Americas, which right now operates in countries like Chile and Puerto Rico and accounted for less than 7 percent of revenue last year. \"There are a few dominant players there; it\u2019s high-growth,\u201d said Amy Yong, a media analyst at\u00a0Macquarie Capital in New York. \u201cCertainly they could add a lot of operational expertise. So it seems like it would be a good time for him to consolidate it.\" There\u2019s no certainty agreement will be reached between Liberty Global and Cable & Wireless, the companies said in separate\u00a0statements Thursday in reaction to media reports. Cable & Wireless also asked its shareholders to take no action. Liberty said it has, under U.K. takeover rules, until Nov. 19 to say whether it plans to make an offer.

There, in footnote No. 15 of the Shenzhen-based company\u2019s balance sheet, is a reference to 11 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) in advance deposits for property projects from third parties and for 1.15 billion yuan that needed to be refunded. At issue is whether these deposits were initially classified properly as current liabilities on Kaisa\u2019s books. Analysts at Lucror Analytics Pte, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities HK Ltd. and BDO Ltd. say the payments have characteristics of interest-bearing debt, and booking them the way Kaisa did may have made metrics that investors use to assess a company\u2019s riskiness appear stronger than they actually were. \u201cWe view anything where the holder can demand repayment as being debt-like,\u201d said Charles Macgregor, head of Asia high-yield research in Singapore at Lucror and a former senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \u201cThe advance deposits in Kaisa\u2019s balance sheet are akin to a convertible bond where the holder has the option to take land or take cash.\u201d Questions over Kaisa\u2019s accounts are now delaying both the restructuring of its $10.5 billion of debt and a takeover worth as much as $1.2 billion by rival Sunac China Holdings Ltd. Asian junk dollar bond yields began climbing in the second half of last year and peaked in January as falling property prices and the slowest economic growth in more than two decades make it harder for companies to pay record debts. Kaisa declined to discuss its accounts, according to its public relations firm IPR Ogilvy & Mather. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company\u2019s auditor, said it couldn\u2019t comment due to client confidentiality. Ernest Kong, a spokesman for Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission, declined to comment. On Feb. 16, Kaisa surprised investors with a stock-exchange filing that disclosed its total debt more than doubled to 65 billion yuan on Dec. 31 from 29.8 billion yuan on June 30. The stock slumped 12 percent in four days. It lost 47 percent over six months before being suspended pending the release of delayed 2014 accounts. In a March 8 statement, Kaisa gave as the first reason for the jump in debt requests from independent third parties for a \u201crefund of their deposits with interest.\u201d It said trust financing and other borrowings also contributed. \u201cInterest-bearing debts came in larger than what we expected, and the significant increase wasn\u2019t well explained by the company,\u201d said Franco Leung, a senior analyst at Moody\u2019s, which rates Kaisa\u2019s debt Ca, just one step from the lowest grade typically signaling default. Kaisa\u2019s troubles started unfolding on Oct. 17 when it denied speculation that Chairman Kwok Ying Shing was missing amid a corruption crackdown in Shenzhen. The founder resigned on Dec. 31 citing health reasons and agreed to sell his family\u2019s controlling stake to Sunac in January. Financial constraints tightened as Shenzhen authorities blocked sales of some developments amid the corruption probe and local creditors obtained court orders to freeze Kaisa\u2019s assets. After examining the books, Sunac Chairman Sun Hongbin said in March overseas creditors don\u2019t understand how serious the situation is. Kwok returned to the helm on April 13, and seven days later the company defaulted on dollar bonds. The deposits outlined in the Sept. 21 interim report differ from proceeds builders get from selling properties ahead of completion, a common item that\u2019s booked under liabilities until developers deliver the projects. Builders in China have to obtain approval from local authorities before they\u2019re allowed to start pre-sales. Leung of Moody\u2019s said Kaisa\u2019s use of advance deposits for projects without pre-sale certificates was \u201cnot common\u201d among Chinese developers. The item started appearing in 2012, when it was 3.37 billion yuan, and almost quadrupled to 13.27 billion yuan by 2013, stock exchange filings show. \u201cThis does look like short-term loans to fund Kaisa\u2019s operations and has probably been reclassified to debt,\u201d said Rui Guo, a credit analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ in Hong Kong. \u201cThere are still quite a few unanswered questions.\u201d Robert Fong, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong, said the advances could have been a form of funding structured as a property sale with conditions. \u201cThe net effect of the arrangements would have made the debt situation look less severe than it actually was,\u201d he said. China\u2019s builders were forced to resort to less transparent forms of financing as the government sought to prevent a property bubble by limiting access to bank loans. Moody\u2019s estimated in a January report that shadow banking assets including trust funding reached a record 45 trillion yuan by Dec. 31, 71 percent of gross domestic product. It is unclear to what extent Kaisa tapped the industry, which is now being more heavily regulated by the government. Two calls and a fax to the China Securities Regulatory Commission press office went unanswered. Kaisa\u2019s net debt to equity ratio of 72.5 percent on June 30 treated deposits from independent third parties as liabilities along with pre-sale proceeds, and not as interest-bearing debt. The metric includes short-term borrowings of 6 billion yuan and long-term debt of 23.8 billion yuan. The median reading of the financial-health benchmark for 197 Chinese property companies was 68.1 percent in their latest filings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Including the 11 billion yuan of advance deposits as debt would have pushed Kaisa\u2019s ratio up to 115.4 percent, Mitsubishi UFJ\u2019s Guo estimated. \u201cThis kind of method -- you could call it gray market borrowing -- is actually quite common in China,\u201d said Andrew Lam, a director at accounting firm BDO. Developers that take advance deposits may lump them under their payable accounts and pay interest as high as 30 percent, he said. While bondholders have become more optimistic about Kaisa\u2019s prospects amid the pending Sunac acquisition -- its  March 2018 dollar bonds have rallied to 58.2 cents on the dollar from 29.6 on Jan. 7 -- the Kaisa episode reinforces one key lesson, according to Guo: Read the fine print. \u201cThe takeaway is for analysts to exercise more scrutiny on such line items of other developers, as there could be hidden debt as well,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1430852400.0,"participant_ids":["1638:HK","CSRZ:CH","MCO:US","1918:HK"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-05\/origins-of-kaisa-default-in-china-sought-in-accounting-footnotes-i9bv09mr","subject":"Origins of Chinese Bond Default Buried in Accounting Footnotes"},{"body":" Sunac China Holdings Ltd. suspended trading in Hong Kong pending an announcement about its proposed acquisition of Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. The Chinese developer didn\u2019t provide further details in its statement on Friday. Tianjin-based Sunac agreed in February to buy a 49 percent stake in cash-strapped rival Kaisa and to make a general offer for the rest of the company. Sunac\u2019s buyout attempt of Kaisa, which is seeking to restructure $10.5 billion of debt, has been complicated by a delay in the troubled company\u2019s financial results and a return of its Chairman Kwok Ying Shing. Kwok told offshore bondholders he may offer them a better restructuring proposal than the one Sunac has made, raising questions about his intention to sell the company. Kwok said he\u2019s   a few alternatives regarding what to do with the developer but couldn\u2019t reveal them until after July 31, when Sunac\u2019s takeover proposal expires, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month. Sunac shares closed 0.8 percent lower at HK$10 on Thursday, before they were suspended. Kaisa, based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, has been suspended from trading since March 31. Sunac has asked for   from Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange to proceed with its acquisition even though Kaisa hasn\u2019t published its audited financial results for 2014, people with knowledge of the matter said in April. Kaisa\u2019s offshore bondholders are waiting to see whether the exchange will grant the waiver before giving a counter-proposal.

The statement followed a call on\u00a0  by investor Mario Gabelli, the largest outside holder of voting stock in Viacom, for more information about Redstone\u2019s condition. Viacom, based in New York, is the parent of the Nickelodeon and MTV cable TV networks. It also owns Paramount Pictures. Gabelli, whose Gamco Asset Management holds about 10 percent of Viacom\u2019s Class A voting stock, and a similar stake in another Redstone holding, CBS Corp., made the comments as the 92-year-old media mogul fights a lawsuit over his mental capacity brought by an ex-girlfriend. Manuela Herzer was thrown out of Redstone\u2019s Beverly Hills, California, home in October and replaced as his proxy on health-care matters by Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman, according to court documents. \u201cViacom..(VIA)...give to Hollywood what belongs to H ..... but give to all shareholders what the Board of Directors know about Executive Chair,\u201d Gabelli wrote on the social network on Tuesday. Gabelli has longstanding ties to many prominent figures in media. Viacom and CBS are two of the biggest media conglomerates in the U.S., with a combined market value of about $43 billion. Redstone, executive chairman of both companies, controls them through his 80 percent ownership of their voting stock. Gabelli didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. On Monday, California Superior Court Judge Clifford Klein sided with Redstone\u2019s attorneys, saying he appeared to be under good care and that there was no urgency to proceed with further  . Klein tentatively scheduled a hearing for Jan. 27 on Redstone\u2019s request to dismiss Herzer\u2019s case. Redstone controls CBS and Viacom through National Amusements Inc., a family holding company. He retains that control until such time as his incapacity or death, according to a filing CBS made with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. At that time, control over Redstone\u2019s stake in National Amusements will pass to a trust with a seven-member board that includes his daughter Shari Redstone, his grandson Tyler Korff, Dauman and four lawyers with long-standing ties to the family. Shari Redstone owns 20 percent of the family company. Gabelli\u2019s combined stake in voting and non-voting shares of CBS and Viacom is worth about $500 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Viacom\u2019s more widely held nonvoting stock fell 4.1 percent to $47.65 at the close in New York. It has declined 37 percent this year through Tuesday and is the worst performer in the S&P 500 Media Index. CBS retreated 2.1 percent to $50.05 and is down 9.6 percent for 2015.

Kwok resigned on Dec. 31 citing health reasons and agreed to sell his family\u2019s controlling stake to Sunac in January, only to return to the helm on April 13. Seven days later the company defaulted on two of its dollar bonds. \u201cIt looks like Kaisa and Sunac are competing for the company and for better terms for the bondholders based on recent media reports,\u201d said Zhi Wei Feng, a senior credit analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. \u201cBut there is so much speculation around the situation which has caused lots of volatility in Kaisa bonds.

Sunac has sought permission from Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange to proceed with its acquisition of a stake in Kaisa even though Kaisa hasn\u2019t published audited results for 2014, people with knowledge of the matter said on April 30. Kaisa\u2019s offshore bondholders are waiting to see whether the bourse grants the waiver before presenting a counter-proposal to the developer\u2019s debt restructuring plan, said one of the people on April 30, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

A Feb. 6 stock exchange statement announcing the stake purchase referred to it as a \u201cmajor\u201d transaction. Kaisa shares have been suspended from trading since March 31. Kaisa\u2019s debt more than doubled to 65 billion yuan ($10.5 billion) at the end of 2014 from six months earlier.

Analysts at Lucror Analytics Pte, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities HK Ltd. and BDO Ltd.

The two industries will drive dealmaking in the U.S. technology, media and telecommunications sector, after pay-TV distribution deals dominated 2014, bankers and analysts say. Content producers, such as AMC Networks Inc. and Starz, are losing viewers to the Internet, and bulking up would help them face off with distributors Comcast Corp. and AT&T Inc. In the semiconductor sector, takeovers offer a way to offset shrinking profit margins -- the result of technological advances and competitive pricing. \u201c2014 was a year in which the distributors -- AT&T and Comcast -- sought to consolidate to achieve the benefits of scale,\u201d said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201c2015 may be the year when the content companies look to re-level the playing field via consolidation of their own.\u201d Comcast\u2019s $68 billion deal for Time Warner Cable Inc. and AT&T\u2019s $66 billion purchase of DirecTV -- which still need regulatory approval -- were last year\u2019s largest acquisitions. The two deals gave pricing power to pay-TV distributors over programmers that don\u2019t have a lot of must-see content, he said. AMC and Scripps Networks Interactive could be among network conglomerates looking for merger partners, said Sweeney. Adding more valuable content would put them in a stronger bargaining position with cable operators. If Comcast and AT&T complete their deals, they will have more leverage over programmers to resist cost increases or threaten to drop their channels. Potential targets include Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc. and Starz, he said. Both participated in failed deal talks in 2014, according to people familiar with the matter. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. discussed buying Starz at the end of last year and may return to acquire the owner of premium pay-TV networks later this year, according to people familiar with the matter. The two companies announced a stock-swap agreement today, giving Starz a 3.4 percent stake in Lions Gate. In return, the Santa Monica, California-based Lions Gate will receive 4.5 percent of Starz\u2019s equity and 14.5 percent of the voting power. Billionaire John Malone, the largest shareholder of Starz, will join Lions Gate\u2019s board. \u201cMy gut tells me Lions Gate is a buyer and Malone is a seller,\u201d said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, who has the equivalent of a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Lions Gate and doesn\u2019t cover Starz. \u201cThere\u2019s financial and strategic value for a combination with Lions Gate.\u201d Lions Gate rose 9.2 percent to $32.42 at the close of trading in New York Wednesday, while Starz gained nearly 3.3 percent. Another fertile area for M&A: digital media companies. Comedy websites The Onion, CollegeHumor and Funny or Die are already weighing sales, according to people familiar with the matter. Viacom Inc. has considered rolling up all three sites, The Information, a technology website,   earlier this year. Representatives for the companies declined to comment or didn\u2019t reply to e-mail or telephone requests for comment. In the semiconductor industry, the consolidation will be most prevalent among companies with market capitalizations between $1 billion and $5 billion, according to Mike Wyatt, Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of global technology mergers and acquisitions. \u201cWith semiconductors, you need to go from highly fragmented and profitless to something where there are sustainable profits so that producers can innovate and develop new products,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cIt\u2019s ripe for further consolidation.\u201d Monolithic Power Systems Inc. and Power Integrations Inc. are both M&A targets in that valuation range, according to Steve Smigie, an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. Last year saw similar deals, including RF Micro Devices Inc.\u2019s $1.6 billion   of TriQuint Semiconductor Inc. In most of those, investors sent both the target and the buyer\u2019s shares higher, a reaction that will capture the attention of chief executives and boards considering acquisitions, said Chris Colpitts, Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s global co-head of technology, media and telecommunications investment banking.","timestamp":1423645201.0,"participant_ids":["LGF:US","STRZA:US","CMCSA:US","T:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-11\/tech-dealmakers-see-media-content-semiconductors-driving-m-a","subject":"Tech Dealmakers See Media Content, Chips Driving M&A"},{"body":" John Malone has structured TripAdvisor Inc. like he\u2019s ready to make a deal. Malone, chairman of Liberty Interactive Corp. as well as several sister companies whose names start with Liberty, is known for engineering complex and lucrative financial arrangements. In August, he did a tax-free spinoff of Liberty Interactive\u2019s controlling interest in TripAdvisor, a $9.7 billion website where users write reviews for vacation resorts. That transaction may soon lead to another. There are two ways it could work: TripAdvisor, to gain its independence, could choose to buy out shareholders of the $1.8 billion holding company, which is called Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings Inc. Or, larger rivals Priceline Group Inc. or Expedia Inc. could buy the holding company to seize control. \u201cJohn Malone is in the business of maximizing the value of his holdings,\u201d said Joseph Stauff, a New York-based analyst on the event-driven\/special situations team at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP. \u201cHe\u2019s got a stake in a publicly traded company and he\u2019s trying to get a premium valuation on that. How does he do it? He punts out his holding in TripAdvisor knowing damn well that more than just TripAdvisor wants to bid for it.\u201d Courtnee Ulrich, a spokeswoman for Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty TripAdvisor, didn\u2019t return a phone call or e-mail seeking comment. Kevin Carter, a spokesman for Newton, Massachusetts-based TripAdvisor, declined to comment. TripAdvisor\u2019s fate is technically now in the hands of Greg Maffei, the chief executive officer of Liberty TripAdvisor, because Malone swapped his voting shares for Maffei\u2019s common shares in December. Malone probably would still want to sign off on any potential deal, and given the pair\u2019s history of working in tandem, the share swap doesn\u2019t mean Malone is detached from the outcome. Malone and Maffei have worked as partners on multiple businesses. Malone is chairman of Liberty TripAdvisor, Liberty Ventures, Liberty Interactive and Liberty Media Corp., while Maffei is CEO of all four. Maffei is also chairman of the Starz network and Live Nation Entertainment Inc. -- billionaire Malone is an investor in both. Maffei said during an investor   in November that Liberty TripAdvisor and TripAdvisor could eventually become one entity but that nothing was planned. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what the future brings,\u201d he said. February marks six months since the spinoff. Typically, a six-month to two-year waiting period is required before any subsequent merger can take place without triggering tax implications. Merging Liberty TripAdvisor and TripAdvisor seems like the most likely eventual outcome, with the remaining question being what kind of a takeover premium is paid to shareholders, said Stauff of Susquehanna and Robert Routh, an analyst for FBN Securities. That said, TripAdvisor would be an appealing target for Priceline or Expedia, the two largest online travel agents in the U.S., as well as Google Inc., they said. TripAdvisor was spun off from Expedia in 2011 and has since grown to attract more than 315 million average monthly unique visitors to its websites. TripAdvisor\u2019s stock price has more than doubled over that time. Analysts project that its revenue growth will continue to exceed that of Priceline and Expedia for the foreseeable future, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cTripAdvisor is linked to all the major sites and it\u2019s become the go-to search engine for travel,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cOnce you become the go-to place and attract more eyeballs than anybody else, your value is irreplicable. Or if it is replicable, it\u2019s at a very high cost.\u201d TripAdvisor shares climbed 4.6 percent to $70.81 on Tuesday. Liberty TripAdvisor surged 5.7 percent to $25.63, its biggest gain in two months. A representative for Norwalk, Connecticut-based Priceline declined to comment on whether the company is interested in a takeover of Liberty TripAdvisor. Representatives for Bellevue, Washington-based Expedia and Google, in Mountain View, California, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The industry leaders have been consolidating Web and mobile-booking services to add users, expand internationally and drive growth. Priceline, which has a market value of $53 billion, scooped up travel site   in 2012 and restaurant-reservation service   in 2014, for $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Expedia, valued at $11 billion, purchased   last month for $280 million, following last year\u2019s acquisition of Australia\u2019s   Holdings Ltd. for about $650 million. Malone\u2019s Liberty Media has a stake in Expedia, which the company has  . While Malone and Maffei are probably planning an eventual merger of Liberty TripAdvisor and TripAdvisor, a sale to another company is possible if the price is right, said Routh. \u201cIf Priceline comes in with a sweetheart deal that Greg Maffei just can\u2019t say no to, could he sell Liberty TripAdvisor? Yes,\u201d Routh said. \u201cTripAdvisor is not in control of its own destiny.\u201d","timestamp":1422914400.0,"participant_ids":["TRIP:US","PCLN:US","EXPE:US","LINTA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-03\/malone-s-tripadvisor-may-be-priceline-s-for-the-taking-real-m-a","subject":"Malone\u2019s TripAdvisor May Be Priceline\u2019s for the Taking"},{"body":" Gregory Maffei used to be the chief executive officer of one media company.

His combined pay from those companies, which were spun off from billionaire John Malone\u2019s former Liberty Media, was $57 million in 2014. Malone, known for engineering complex and lucrative financial arrangements, has placed increasing trust in Maffei since he joined Liberty in 2005. He swapped his voting shares in Liberty TripAdvisor for Maffei\u2019s common shares in December, giving the executive control of the company. \u201cWhenever Malone turns the keys over to one of his lieutenants, it\u2019s always a show of faith,\u201d said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Capital USA Inc. \u201cMaffei has made the Malone family a lot of money.\u201d Maffei and two other Malone CEOs are the three best-paid media executives in the U.S. Maffei\u2019s compensation is less than that of Discovery Communications Inc. CEO David Zaslav and Liberty Global Plc CEO Michael Fries, who also run companies in which Malone owns shares. The pair were awarded $94.9 and $86.7 million, respectively, in their most-recent fiscal years for which data is available, ranking them No. 7 and No. 8 on the Bloomberg Pay Index. Whit Clay, a spokesman for the Liberty businesses, declined to comment beyond the companies\u2019 filings. Maffei\u2019s compensation is comprised of mostly stock options. He received options valued at $30.4 million from Liberty Media, $10.9 million from Liberty Interactive, $4.13 million at Liberty TripAdvisor and $4.77 million at Liberty Broadband, at the companies\u2019 Dec. 31 fiscal year end. He only gets a salary, bonus and perks from Liberty Media and Liberty Interactive. His salary was a combined $1.82 million and cash bonuses were $6.12 million. He also incurred a total of $493,871 in costs tied to personal use of company aircraft. Maffei sits on the boards of nine Liberty-affiliated companies. Four of those -- TripAdvisor Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc., Starz and Sirius XM Holdings Inc.-- paid him less than $1 million combined in directors fees, which aren\u2019t included in the ranking\u2019s tally. \u201cAlthough most of the businesses of these companies were once part of the same predecessor company, Liberty Media Corporation, Liberty Interactive Corporation, Liberty Broadband Corporation, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings Inc., Starz and Liberty Global Plc are separate public companies,\u201d according to Liberty Media\u2019s  . Maffei isn\u2019t the only executive that receives pay from more than one company. Billionaire Sumner Redstone is executive chairman of CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc., and received pay from both companies. NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. spun off NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. in 2014. David Hamamoto is CEO of the businesses and was granted compensation from both. Malone has a net worth of $7.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In the past decade, his media conglomerate has done several spinoffs of subsidiary businesses to its shareholders. The deals serve to increase transparency of asset values to shareholders and to help the companies raise capital, Yong said. Maffei became CEO of Liberty Interactive, Liberty TripAdvisor and Liberty Broadband upon completion of each spinoff. The company spun off its international cable business, which became Liberty Global, in 2004. The next year, it hired Maffei, who\u2019d served as Oracle Corp.\u2019s chief financial officer. He\u2019d previously held the same role at Microsoft Corp. That same year, Liberty Media sold its 50 percent stake in Discovery Communications, which owns TV channels such as TLC and the Oprah Winfrey Network. In 2011, Liberty Media was spun off from Liberty Interactive, which wholly owns QVC and has a stake in publicly-traded HSN Inc., the owner of home-shopping television channels. Liberty Media was also spun off from Starz in 2013. Liberty Interactive spun off Liberty TripAdvisor last year. That business owns a stake in travel website TripAdvisor Inc. and wholly owns party supply- and costume-seller Buy Seasons Inc.

Instead, the daughter of 92-year-old Sumner Redstone and heir to his media empire prefers her own four seats outside, near the 50-yard line, cheering with less-famous fans even in freezing temperatures. Redstone, 61, doesn\u2019t hobnob in Hollywood either. She\u2019s never been to the Oscars or the Vanity Fair after-party. Yet she is poised to become the most powerful woman in entertainment, with a big say in what happens at CBS Corp., the most-watched TV network, and Viacom Inc., owner of Paramount Pictures. Her father, who is in poor health, made Shari and her 29-year-old son, Tyler Korff, the sole family representatives among seven trustees who will control $5.4 billion of stock in CBS and Viacom after he dies. As the eldest family member voting on the trust and mother of three beneficiaries, Redstone will play a major role at both companies -- even though, under the estate\u2019s structure, she has to share power with other trustees, including Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman. \u201cHer position is assured to some extent,\u201d said her friend James Packer, the Australian casino billionaire. \u201cAnyone who underestimates her is making a mistake.\u201d Big questions hang over Sumner Redstone\u2019s empire: Who will succeed him as chairman of Viacom and CBS? Will Viacom recover from shrinking TV ratings? And will either company succumb to merger mania sweeping the media industry? Redstone, who divides her time between Boston and New York, declined to comment for this story. She encouraged friends to speak, however. A picture emerges of a leader who prefers to focus on the companies\u2019 success rather than having an operational role; who values being in the family business her father built, and who is keenly interested in the emerging technologies roiling the media industry. \u201cShe\u2019s much more concerned with outcomes than being in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d said Jon Miller, former CEO of AOL and a partner in Advancit Capital, her Norwood, Massachusetts-based venture capital firm. \u201cShe\u2019s been very consistent with me: \u2018What I want to see is the companies do well. I don\u2019t have to be an executive in either.\u2019\u201d Redstone is already a billionaire, having inherited 20 percent of National Amusements Inc., the family theater business where she is president. The company holds the CBS and Viacom stakes. While Sumner Redstone is a larger-than-life mogul who famously clung to a ledge during a hotel fire and fought multibillion-dollar takeover battles, his daughter is described as more down to earth. She does her homework, listens, shows good judgment and looks for new ideas to meet challenges, according to Harvard Law School Dean Martha Minow. Two decisions to be made in the post-Sumner world concern the high-profile CEOs, Viacom\u2019s Dauman and CBS\u2019s Les Moonves. Their contracts let them leave if they aren\u2019t made chairmen of their companies after Sumner is gone. Shari Redstone is vice chair of both Viacom and CBS. While CBS is thriving, Viacom, the owner of Nickelodeon and MTV, is losing younger viewers to online services, writing off investments in TV shows and cutting jobs. \u201cI know how respectful she is to Les in particular,\u201d Packer said. \u201cPhilippe with Viacom is going through some issues.\u201d CBS and Viacom officials declined to comment. Viacom has reorganized management of its cable networks and is taking steps to increase digital revenue, Dauman said on an April 30 conference call. The elder Redstone celebrated his 92nd birthday last week in Los Angeles at a bash put on by his 43-year-old girlfriend. The guests, including Dauman and Moonves, were entertained by crooner Tony Bennett. Shari Redstone wasn\u2019t invited; her son Korff, a lawyer and a rabbi, got clearance to attend only hours before the event, after landing in Los Angeles, according to a person with knowledge of the event who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss it and asked not to be named. Shari Redstone, a lawyer trained at Boston University, has been most involved with the Norwood-based theater chain started by her grandfather in 1936. She cuts a much lower profile than the women who populate lists like the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Power 100, which ranks influential female entertainment executives such as Bonnie Hammer, chairman of Comcast Corp.\u2019s cable-TV channels, Stacey Snider, co-chairman of the 20th Century Fox film studio, and Oprah Winfrey. Assuming her grip holds, Redstone will leapfrog those executives, playing a major role in M&A decisions, board membership and CEO-level hiring at the two New York-based companies with a combined market value of $57 billion. It would take a mutiny by the trustees to derail Redstone. In addition to her, her son and Dauman, those overseeing the trust include four lawyers with longstanding ties to the family, with a responsibility to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries -- Sumner\u2019s five grandchildren. As CEOs, Moonves and Dauman will answer to corporate directors that could be removed by the trust. Redstone is conscious of her family\u2019s history. At National Amusements, she supervised the opening of Legacy Place, a $200 million shopping center in Dedham, Massachusetts, built where her grandfather Michael \u201cMickey\u201d Redstone opened one of his first   theaters. Her son-in-law, Jason Ostheimer, is a partner with her in Advancit. \u201cShe was always immensely proud of CBS and Viacom and proud of her father and grandfather, and very much into the family reputation,\u201d said Paul Heth, who was a partner of Shari Redstone\u2019s in theater ventures. \u201cShe sees Viacom and CBS as a legacy of her family, and it needs to be looked after in the best of ways.\u201d Redstone and Heth are credited with pioneering higher-end food and seating in cinemas, with the opening of the Bridge cinema in Los Angeles in 2001. The pair also became partners in a Russian movie-theater venture, sold in 2011 for about $170 million, according to a local newspaper. Redstone was the only U.S. theater executive willing to consider joining him in Russia, Heth said, adding they made a substantial profit. He recalled her standing up to a Russian executive who wanted her to pay a high rent in his mall. \u201cShe looked at him and said, \u2018You want to be careful what you\u2019re asking for. You will not be able to sustain this, so ultimately you will not be a success. Let\u2019s talk about how we can both be successful,\u2019\u201d Heth said. \u201cThe guy was a little taken aback, but when they thought about her point it turned out to be correct. She immediately had their respect.\u201d Advancit, her venture capital company, was an early investor in  , an online video company sold to Walt Disney Co. for as much as $950 million last year. She realized a 10-fold gain on a $100,000 or so investment, according to another person familiar with the matter. Redstone\u2019s influence could potentially thrust her into Hollywood controversies, such as the gender gap in pay, ageism and male actors having veto power over their women co-stars. In April, she took part in a White House panel about access to the justice system for the poor, speaking in an unmistakable Boston accent. The family history has been controversial. In the late 1960s, Mickey Redstone and Sumner fought with Sumner\u2019s younger brother, Edward, over his role. Edward was bought out in 1972. In 2006, Sumner\u2019s only son, Brent, sued National Amusements to gain control of his stake. He was bought out too. Shari Redstone also tussled publicly with her father before reconciling. Standard & Poor\u2019s said in October it may lower National Amusements\u2019 debt ratings, because of low profitability at its theaters. The company counts on dividends from CBS and Viacom as a crucial source of income. Tad Jankowski, National Amusements\u2019 general counsel, declined to comment on the theaters\u2019 profitability or the S&P report. Like her father, Shari has an argumentative streak. Miller said the two disagreed over an Advancit investment. After he presented his case for the company, which he declined to name, she changed her mind and doubled the firm\u2019s commitment. \u201cShe very much believes the media landscape is evolving rapidly and she wants to be on top of the changes,\u201d Miller said.","timestamp":1433120461.0,"participant_ids":["VIAB:US","CBS:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-01\/shari-redstone-pulled-to-hollywood-power-circles-as-father-fades","subject":"Shari Redstone Pulled to Hollywood Power Circles as Father Fades"},{"body":" CBS Corp. is negotiating with Apple Inc. to be part of the new Apple TV offering, Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves said.

Zulily on Monday   to sell itself to Liberty Interactive Corp.\u2019s QVC for about $18.75 a share in cash and stock, or about $2 billion after subtracting net cash. The per-share price is a small fraction of the company\u2019s $72.75 peak, reached in February 2014. The offer values the online purveyor of parenting goods, from burp cloths to maternity wear, at about 1.6 times its sales in the last year. That\u2019s roughly equal to the multiple that Verizon Communications Inc.  this year for AOL, which is growing half as quickly as Zulily. Verizon\u2019s $4.4 billion offer was considered low when it was announced in May but probably the best AOL could get. After unraveling its failed megamerger with Time Warner, AOL   itself into a provider of ad-purchasing technology that Verizon could pair with content for mobile devices. Zulily, on the other hand, has stumbled recently. The company is rejiggering its marketing plan after customer growth   and sales missed estimates in some quarters. \u201cWhen you see the growth slow down for these Internet names, investors just head for the hills,\u201d said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously getting it on the cheap. A lot of Zulily shareholders probably view this as a lifeline.\u201d Before news of the sale, Zulily shares were down 46 percent this year and trading less than $2 above their all-time low. While Zulily\u2019s revenue has been increasing much faster than AOL\u2019s, the 13 percent growth projected for this year is a far cry from the triple-digit expansion of the retailer\u2019s heyday. A premium of more than 40 percent is hard to turn down -- even if the purchase price is lower than the $22 that Zulily fetched in its initial public offering in November 2013. Analysts on average predicted the stock on its own would go to just $13.13 over the next year, even amid signs of improvement in the second quarter. There probably won\u2019t be any counter-bidders, so shareholders likely have their best option in front of them, said Jason Helfstein, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.

Malone will obtain a 3.4 percent stake in Lions Gate, producer of the multibillion-dollar \u201cHunger Games\u201d movies and \u201cMad Men\u201d TV show, and join the studio\u2019s board, according to a statement Wednesday. Lions Gate gets a 4.5 percent stake in Starz and 14.5 percent of the voting power. The alliance gives Lions Gate a potential new outlet for its growing TV production business. Starz, in turn, can obtain fresh shows that help it compete with HBO and Showtime, the top premium pay-TV channels. \u201cIt could be, at the very least, a deal where Lions Gate and Starz cooperate in the development of programing,\u201d said Paul Sweeney, a media analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cA lot of investors see this as the first step of John Malone trying to control Lions Gate.\u201d \u201cWe are thrilled to have him on the board,\u201d Michael Burns, vice chairman of Lions Gate, said of Malone on CNBC. The cable industry pioneer wanted to increase his exposure to content around the globe, Burns said. Starz has looked for a potential tie-up since at least 2012 when Chairman Greg Maffei, who also serves as chief executive officer of Malone\u2019s Liberty Media Corp., said the network would be more valuable combined with a media company that operates other cable channels. Liberty Media spun off Starz two years ago. Lions Gate, an investor in the Epix premium channel, has similarly been looking for a merger for some time. The company unsuccessfully sought deal talks with Sony Corp., and has held discussions with China\u2019s Dalian Wanda Group Co., which controls the second-largest U.S. cinema chain. \u201cAny time investors see John Malone taking an equity stake in a company, the expectation is at some point Malone will want to own the company or merge it with one of his existing companies or somehow increase his control over that company,\u201d Sweeney said. Starz, based in Englewood, Colorado, rose 3.5 percent to $31.76 at the close in New York. Lions Gate, run from Santa Monica, California, surged 9.2 percent to $32.42 at the close, the most in more than two years. Starz, which has more than 50 million subscribers, offers a mix of films and original programming like \u201cOutlander,\u201d a drama based on a series of novels by Diana Gabaldon, and \u201cThe Chair,\u201d a documentary series about a competition between directors attempting to make their first feature film. Content producers and programmers have weighed a variety of deals to gain bargaining power against pay-TV providers, which are also consolidating. Comcast Corp. is awaiting regulatory approval to buy Time Warner Cable Inc. for $45.2 billion and AT&T Inc. has agreed to acquire DirecTV. Last year, Starz tried unsuccessfully to find a buyer for the company, and was passed over by Lions Gate, as well as CBS Corp., AMC Networks Inc. and 21st Century Fox Inc. because potential bidders thought the network was overvalued, people familiar with the matter said in December. In lieu of selling itself, Starz considered investments and partnerships with U.S.- based or European-based media companies, one of the people said. The deal with Lions Gate -- which has also produced TV shows like the Netflix Inc. original series \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d and the broadcast series \u201cNashville\u201d -- may be the content partnership that Malone was looking for. \u201cLionsgate has emerged as a leader in developing global content, and this transaction creates the potential for a number of strategic opportunities around the world with them,\u201d Malone said in the statement.","timestamp":1423657395.0,"participant_ids":["LGF:US","0599663D:US","LMCA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-11\/malone-to-join-lions-gate-board-in-stock-swap-deal-with-starz","subject":"Malone\u2019s Starz Forms Alliance With Lions Gate in Stock Swap"},{"body":" In hindsight, maybe Comcast Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts should have just played nice. More than a year after Roberts unexpectedly backed out of talks with Charter Communications Inc. to divvy up Time Warner Cable Inc. between the two of them -- opting instead to make a bid to buy it all himself -- it seems he will end up with nothing. Comcast withdrew its bid for Time Warner Cable Friday after concluding the merger would be rejected by regulators. The Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice were both in favor of blocking the deal, Bloomberg   Wednesday. \u201cComcast rolled the dice on what was from the beginning a high-risk regulatory strategy,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC in New York. \u201cIt clearly would have been safer to take a back seat to a Charter-led deal. But they ultimately decided that the rewards of control were high enough to warrant the risk.\u201d The deal would have positioned Roberts to challenge John Malone for a distinction coined by pundits as the \u201cking of cable.\u201d Malone, who owns media assets including Sirius XM Holdings Inc. and more than a quarter of Charter, now has a chance to retain the title if Charter can hammer out a deal for Time Warner Cable. When asked in November if Charter would attempt to buy Time Warner Cable if the Comcast deal failed, Malone responded, \u201cHell yes.\u201d The tangled negotiations began when Charter made a hostile offer in January of $132.50 to acquire Time Warner Cable. Behind the scenes, Charter and Comcast were already discussing how they would carve up Time Warner Cable once the deal was done. Comcast would get subscribers in regions including New York City, North Carolina, New England and potentially Los Angeles, while Charter would get the rest. Roberts soon soured on the idea, and instead blindsided Charter by making a bid to buy all of Time Warner Cable. One reason was that he wasn\u2019t happy with how Charter and Malone\u2019s Liberty Media Corp. were badmouthing Time Warner Cable, unusual in a traditionally collegial industry, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Charter Chief Operating Officer John Bickham had publicly criticized the strategy and management of Time Warner Cable to convince investors that Time Warner Cable would be better run by Charter. Roberts had another reason to act. Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus preferred to do a deal with Roberts rather than with Greg Maffei, Malone\u2019s principal deal negotiator and CEO of Liberty Media, according to people familiar with the matter. To entice Roberts, Time Warner Cable didn\u2019t insist on Comcast paying a breakup fee if regulators turned against the deal. Comcast and Charter ended up reaching a side pact after Comcast\u2019s bid for Time Warner Cable was accepted. Comcast agreed to shed four million subscribers to Charter and a new entity Charter would control. Still, the acquisition was framed as Comcast buying Time Warner Cable, rather than Charter as the acquirer. That proved to be politically sensitive, as the proposed merger of the two big cable operators drew complaints from consumer groups and some lawmakers. This is Roberts\u2019s second failed attempt at a huge media acquisition. Comcast made a $54 billion hostile bid for Walt Disney Co. in 2004, which was rejected by Disney\u2019s board and subsequently withdrawn. \u201cThe failed acquisition of Time Warner Cable has to be viewed as a major disappointment for Brian Roberts and the Comcast management team,\u201d said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cWhile the prospects for Comcast remain bright, the company put a lot of resources into getting this deal done.\u201d Working with Charter to acquire prized pieces of Time Warner Cable, including New York and Los Angeles, would have drawn less regulatory scrutiny than the merger of the nation\u2019s two biggest cable operators, Sweeney said. Charter has only about 4.3 million video subscribers, while Comcast has more than 22 million customers and Time Warner Cable has about 11 million. Comcast also owns NBC Universal, giving the company significant media power that Charter doesn\u2019t have. Charter now has no incentive to work with Comcast if it makes another run at acquiring Time Warner Cable, as Comcast is no longer a threat to bid. Comcast may be better off in the long run focusing its efforts on buying a wireless company or more content, Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG in New York, said Thursday on Bloomberg TV. Still, it\u2019s hard not to see this as a failed gambit for Roberts, he suggested. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t lose ever,\u201d Greenfield said of Roberts\u2019s deal history and clout in Washington. \u201cThis is obviously kind of an ego blow.\u201d","timestamp":1429807740.0,"participant_ids":["CMCSA:US","CHTR:US","TWC:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-23\/comcast-s-roberts-faces-rare-defeat-after-trying-to-go-it-alone","subject":"Comcast\u2019s Roberts Faces Rare Defeat After Trying to Go It Alone"},{"body":" Advisers for Charter Communications Inc. have reached out to Time Warner Cable Inc. to begin friendly talks on an acquisition after Comcast Corp. withdrew its bid for the company, people with knowledge of the matter said. Charter\u2019s goal is to buy Time Warner Cable quickly, though executives from the companies haven\u2019t spoken yet, the people said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are private. Charter has approached banks about financing, one person said. Talks are at an early stage and haven\u2019t yet addressed price or structure, and may not result in a deal, the people said. Time Warner Cable\u2019s already expressed concern that a combined company may be too indebted, one person said, though Charter\u2019s planned acquisition of Bright House Networks LLC for $10.4 billion may help mitigate those concerns because it will give Charter more borrowing capacity. Time Warner Cable jumped 5.5 percent to $157 as of 3:01 p.m. in New York, giving the company a market value of about $44 billion. Charter slipped 0.2 percent to $183.31. Charter and its largest shareholder, Liberty Media Corp. have publicly stated their desire to acquire Time Warner Cable if Comcast\u2019s deal fell through. When asked in November if Charter would attempt to buy Time Warner Cable if the Comcast deal failed, billionaire John Malone responded, \u201cHell yes.\u201d Comcast Friday   its $45.2 billion offer -- valued at about $158.82 a share -- after regulatory pushback. Charter attempted to buy Time Warner Cable for $132.50 a share last January in a hostile bid. Charter would like to get a friendly deal completed, according to one of the people. It would probably have to pay more than Comcast\u2019s per-share offer to appease Time Warner Cable, the person said. A Charter deal with Time Warner Cable could have an easier path with regulators. The combined company would have about 17 million broadband and 15 million video customers. Comcast\u2019s deal with Time Warner Cable would have given the combined company about 30 million video customers. Bright House has 2.5 million subscribers that would go to Charter if that deal is completed. A Charter-Time Warner Cable deal \u201cwouldn\u2019t have enough subscribers to attract that much regulatory scrutiny,\u201d said Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. And while regulators may have been worried that Comcast\u2019s ownership of NBCUniversal gave it too much power over TV programming and distribution, Charter would not raise the same concerns because it doesn\u2019t own a TV network.

Last month, Charter, the fourth-biggest cable operator,   to buy Bright House, the No. 6 in the industry, for $10.4 billion. That deal is now in jeopardy because it had depended on   closing its merger with Time Warner Cable Inc. Comcast, the industry leader, dropped its $45.2 billion plan last week after concluding regulators would reject it. Charter and Bright House, as part of their agreement, are required to renegotiate in good faith if the Comcast deal collapsed, Charter Chief Executive Officer Thomas Rutledge said during an earnings call Friday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re doing that,\u201d Rutledge said. Charter\u2019s accord with Bright House requires the companies to negotiate for 30 days after the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal failed, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. During that time, Time Warner Cable can match any offer Charter makes for Bright House, the person said. Time Warner Cable has the right to block a Charter-Bright House deal because of Time Warner Cable\u2019s longstanding arrangement to negotiate programming and other deals for Bright House, which has 2.5 million subscribers in markets such as Detroit, Indianapolis and the Tampa Bay area. Charter reported a wider loss in the first quarter because of costs associated with financing a deal with Comcast. Charter had agreed to take control of 3.9 million Comcast cable-TV customers to ease approval of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. Charter will no longer get those customers now. The net loss was $81 million, or 73 cents a share, compared with a loss of $37 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier, Charter said Friday in a statement. Revenue rose 7.3 percent to $2.36 billion, driven by Internet subscriber growth, shy of the $2.37 billion average of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Charter rose 0.2 percent to $187.44 at the close in New York trading. The shares have climbed 12 percent this year.

Charter advisers have   out to Time Warner Cable to begin talks on an acquisition, people with knowledge of the matter have said.

Niel\u2019s holding includes a potential 10 percent stake stemming from six options contracts and the remainder based on other long positions, according to a filing released by Italy\u2019s market regulator Consob Friday.

The settlement date for the first option, for a 4.9 percent stake, is on June 21, 2016, with the dates for the other five tranches of 1 percent each from January 2017 to November 2017. No details were disclosed about Niel\u2019s remaining securities. The Italian government led by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said it\u2019s monitoring Telecom Italia developments. The company is strategic for Italy and any change in its shareholding structure must follow market rules and strengthen Telecom Italia\u2019s business, Cabinet Undersecretary Claudio De Vincenti said in a statement. Consob is reviewing whether Niel and Vivendi may be acting in concert on Telecom Italia. Niel and Vivendi declined to comment Thursday, and didn\u2019t immediately return requests for responses Friday. Patuano said he didn\u2019t see the two French billionaires acting together to take over Telecom Italia. \u201cWe see both Vivendi and Mr. Niel as aligned in their goal of unlocking value at TI; we see them driven by the value creation opportunity,\u201d Haitong Research analysts said in a note. Its\u00a0unlikely\u00a0that\u00a0Vivendi\u00a0and\u00a0Niel\u00a0are\u00a0acting together or competing with each other for power over Telecom Italia, the analysts said. Last year Italy lowered the threshold for a mandatory takeover offer to 25 percent from 30 percent for companies with a market capitalization of more than 500 million euros and revenue above 300 million euros in an effort to protect minority shareholders and to discourage investors who aren\u2019t committed to a long-term industrial plan.

The newly elected governor seated Mike Long of Arrow Electronics Inc., then based on Long Island, across the table from Kent Thiry of DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., which had relocated to Denver from El Segundo, California, in 2010. Within months, Long\u2019s corporation was also headquartered in Colorado. Such relocations have fueled job gains that led Colorado\u2019s economy to improve more in the past five years than any other state except North Dakota and Michigan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Denver recorded the sixth-highest economic growth among U.S. metropolitan areas in 2014. \u201cI ask the CEOs, \u2018If I want your business to grow jobs what should I be doing?\u2019\u201d Hickenlooper, 63, said in an interview. \u201cOnce someone sits at your kitchen table and you eat, I think you have a much better working relationship.\u201d The Democratic governor\u2019s name has surfaced as a potential running mate for Hillary Clinton. \u201cI think there is an opportunity there for whether it\u2019s me or someone else, to have a vice president and make them like a chief operating officer,\u201d Hickenlooper said. A former brew pub and restaurant owner, the governor counts many of Colorado\u2019s top Republican executives among his closest advisers and biggest campaign donors as he works to diversify the economy from its roots in mining and oil and gas extraction. When he\u2019s not selling Colorado to potential employers, Hickenlooper is on the road encouraging residents to take a risk by transforming their hobbies into the next Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., Crocs Inc. or Celestial Seasonings Inc., all based in Colorado. Boulder claims the nation\u2019s highest technology startup density, followed by the Fort Collins-Loveland metro area, according to an August 2013   by startup advocacy group Engine and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Entrepreneurs are fueling the state\u2019s 4.2 percent unemployment rate -- lower than the national 5.5 percent rate in March -- alongside global aggregators such as Liberty Media Corp., Arrow and IHS Inc., which add jobs as they buy companies. Colorado bonds have surpassed the performance of those in other states. Anyone who bought the debt of Colorado and held it the past 12 months has an after-tax return of 4.61 percent, or almost a percentage point more than the average for state governments in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The state ranked No. 4 in employment growth with 297,000 jobs created during the past 5 years, No. 5 in personal-income growth, No. 4 in home price appreciation and No. 7 in the decline in mortgage delinquencies, Bloomberg data show. Still, some small business owners want Hickenlooper to do more to address layers of regulation that boost their compliance costs to $13,000 per employee each year versus the $7,000 annually that larger companies pay, said Tony Gagliardi, the Colorado state director of the National Federation of Independent Business. \u201cWe see these new companies coming to Colorado and we\u2019re still asking what\u2019s being done to help us,\u201d Gagliardi said. \u201cI do appreciate the position he\u2019s in, but we would like to see some more visibility from him. He campaigned on these issues, he\u2019s a small businessman, he should be more aware of them.\u201d Hickenlooper honed his sales pitch to chief executives as Denver\u2019s mayor, an office he held from 2003 to 2010. In a meeting at his office in 2008, DaVita\u2019s Thiry asked the governor-elect what he was doing that would improve the quality of life for DaVita\u2019s employees\u2019 children and grandchildren. \u201cThat\u2019s when he got the most energized and waved off his staff and canceled his next meeting,\u201d Thiry said in an interview. \u201cHe talked expansively about protecting the environment and growing education.\u201d In relocating his company, Thiry chose Denver over Chicago and Dallas, he said. In 2012, DaVita opened a new $100-million headquarters downtown in the middle of one of the country\u2019s largest concentrations of millennial workers aged 25 to 34. Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, is on the board of Thiry\u2019s company. Hickenlooper turned first to business and then to politics after losing his job as an oil-industry geologist in the late 1980s. He checked out a book from the Denver Public Library on how to write a business plan, he said, and opened the state\u2019s first brew pub, The Wynkoop Brewing Co. By the late 1990s, Hickenlooper owned more than a dozen pubs and restaurants. The governor\u2019s background is on display in his office in the gold-domed state capitol with a view of the Rocky Mountains. In a corner sits a Martin guitar, a gift from Denver-based rock band The Fray. The guitar speaks to Denver\u2019s cultural renaissance. Known in the 1980s for its decaying downtown, the city today is home to more live music venues than Nashville, Hickenlooper said. During his tenure as governor, 16 companies, including Ardent Mills, Hitachi Data Systems Corp. and the Outdoor Channel have chosen Colorado for their headquarters, according to the state\u2019s Office of Economic Development & International Trade. Since it moved to Denver in 2011, $22.8-billion Arrow Electronics took a similar path, making 35 acquisitions, said John Hourigan, the company\u2019s vice president of global communications. Ardent Mills, which combined the operations of ConAgra Mills and Horizon Milling, is another new arrival in Colorado. After discovering Denver wasn\u2019t on the short list for the company\u2019s home base, Hickenlooper approached Bill Stoufer, now the company\u2019s chief operating officer, and began his sales pitch. \u201cOne of the things I gave him was I said, \u2018If you come, I will introduce you to the other CEOs who might be able to help you grow your business,\u2019\u201d Hickenlooper recalled. \u201cWe are very collaborative here.

Another is waiting in the wings. Comcast Corp. dropped its  , valued at about $158.82 a share, to buy Time Warner Cable Friday after concluding regulators would reject it. Charter Communications Inc.\u2019s advisers have already reached out to Time Warner Cable to begin talks on an acquisition, people with knowledge of the matter said. Charter, the fourth-largest U.S. cable provider, lost out to Comcast more than a year ago in an effort to buy Time Warner Cable. Now it wants another shot. John Malone, who controls Charter\u2019s largest investor, Liberty Media Corp., said \u201chell yes\u201d in November when asked if Charter would try again if the Comcast deal failed. The big question isn\u2019t whether Charter will bid again, but for how much. It would likely have to dole out more than Comcast agreed to pay, which topped Charter\u2019s own $132.50-a-share hostile bid in January 2014. Time Warner Cable shares have increased about 14 percent since then. The price could be at least $151 a share, according to an estimate from Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cTime Warner Cable showed no appetite for being acquired by Charter at the time, and our suspicion is that that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Moffett said late Thursday in a note to clients. \u201cTime Warner Cable is certain to argue that they are worth more now than they were then.\u201d Charter\u2019s goal is to buy Time Warner Cable quickly, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Charter, based in Stamford, Connecticut, has approached banks about financing, one person said. Executives at the companies haven\u2019t spoken yet and the issue of price or structure hasn\u2019t been addressed, the people said. The talks may not result in a deal, they said. After the planned merger with Comcast was terminated, Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Officer Rob Marcus said that his company was \u201ca one-of-a-kind asset.\u201d \u201cWe are confident we will continue to create significant value for shareholders,\u201d Marcus said in a statement. Time Warner Cable, which is based in New York, jumped 4.4 percent to $155.26 as the close in New York, giving the company a market value of about $43.6 billion. Charter rose 1.2 percent to $185.75. After blocking Comcast\u2019s deal, regulators have signaled they are taking a tough stance on mergers that give too much power over the broadband market to one company. \u201cAny company that considers buying Time Warner Cable must carefully consider whether they can get it through the regulatory approvals,\u201d Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Co., said in a note to clients Friday. Charter could make another attempt to buy Time Warner Cable in the next three months, Martin said. There don\u2019t appear to be any other interested buyers, she said. A Charter deal with Time Warner Cable could have an easier path with regulators, partly because the combined company would have fewer subscribers, said Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. That combination would result in about 15 million video customers. Comcast\u2019s deal with Time Warner Cable would have given the combined company about 29 million video customers. And while regulators may have been concerned that Comcast\u2019s ownership of NBCUniversal gave it too much power over TV programming and distribution, Charter wouldn\u2019t raise the same concerns because it doesn\u2019t own a TV network. The collapse of Comcast\u2019s deal sets off a cascade of recalculations in the businesses of broadband Internet and delivery of television and movies. Another Charter deal, the agreement to buy  , is in jeopardy because it was contingent on the Comcast deal closing. Bright House has a total of 2.5 million subscribers. Time Warner Cable has the right to block Charter\u2019s agreement with Bright House as part of its long-time arrangement to negotiate programming and other deals for Bright House, the sixth-largest cable provider. Instead of being acquired by Charter, Time Warner Cable could decide to buy Bright House, Ranganathan said. \u201cThat would give Time Warner Cable ammunition if they weren\u2019t interested in being acquired by Charter,\u201d she said.","timestamp":1429896398.0,"participant_ids":["TWC:US","CHTR:US","CMCSA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-24\/time-warner-cable-loses-one-suitor-while-another-s-in-the-wings","subject":"Time Warner Cable Loses One Suitor, While Another\u2019s in the Wings"},{"body":"If old phones could talk, the one that Paul J. Taubman carries\u00a0around in his pocket could tell several trillion dollars worth of Wall Street stories. That black Samsung flip phone, which Taubman has relied on since the early 2000s because of its superior sound quality and long battery life, has helped him\u00a0pull off a long list of deals from Pfizer Inc.\u2019s $64 billion\u00a0takeover\u00a0of Wyeth to Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s $130 billion buyout of Vodafone Group Plc\u2019s wireless stake. His three-decade run, at Morgan Stanley and then on his own, turned Taubman into one of the most successful mergers-and-acquisitions artists of all time. Now, that phone will be working to enrich a new master on a new high-stakes job just as deepening turmoil in global markets threatens the M&A boom. The 54-year-old dealmaker is combining his own startup, PJT Partners Inc., with the mergers and restructuring businesses of Blackstone Group LP, the private-equity giant headed by Stephen Schwarzman. Whether Taubman can turn PJT, which goes public on Thursday, into a success is anyone\u2019s guess. Boutique M&A shops have come and gone over the years.\u00a0And he has no experience running a publicly traded company. But few have the expertise of Taubman, the PJT of the new firm, or the financial firepower of Blackstone, whose market value dwarfs its three closest competitors. In fact, more than 200 Blackstone bankers spanning M&A, restructuring and\u00a0alternative-asset fundraising are joining PJT, jump-starting growth in a way that has put rival boutiques on notice. \u201cPeople have built their firms completely from scratch, and we\u2019re stepping into a business that\u2019s, you know, already very well established,\u201d Taubman said. For his part, Schwarzman is staking some of his considerable fortune on Taubman, who earned his rainmaking reputation by working on many of the largest deals in history. The 68-year-old billionaire is PJT\u2019s largest investor, owning a stake valued at roughly $136 million. M&A advisory is \u201calso sort of where I made my career,\u201d Schwarzman said. \u201cSeparating these businesses was emotionally difficult for me, personally.\u201d The move comes just as worries about China\u2019s slowdown and the commodities collapse may spoil the record pace of dealmaking and chill M&A for months to come. While 2015 will probably still go down as one of the strongest in history, the turmoil damped some enthusiasm for PJT\u2019s public-market debut. Early trading began for some investors this month, and shares have fallen for five straight days since rising above $29 apiece, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On Tuesday, the stock declined 10 percent to $23.50. Volume has fluctuated between 300 shares and 81,000 shares a day, on a when-issued basis. Like many other boutiques before it, PJT is looking to capitalize on the resurgence in M&A to win more high-profile mandates as companies seek alternatives to Wall Street\u2019s \u201cbulge-bracket\u201d firms\u00a0in the post-crisis era. This year, Lazard Ltd.,\u00a0the biggest independent investment bank, and Centerview Partners, the firm led by\u00a0Blair Effron and\u00a0Robert Pruzan, won the prized advisory roles for the $55.4 billion deal that created Kraft Heinz Co. -- the largest without any big banks in at least a decade. Veteran dealmaker Ken Moelis has more than doubled staff since taking his firm public in April 2014. Evercore Partners Inc. and Guggenheim Partners have also added bankers. Now, as Taubman jumps into the fray, he\u2019s pitching PJT as a \u201cstart-up with instant scale.\u201d In addition to Blackstone\u2019s\u00a0bankers, Taubman has been aggressively picking-off talent, notably from his old firm. Taubman recruited Scott Matlock, the ex-Morgan Stanley chairman for international mergers, and Christopher Harland, who oversaw Latin America coverage, among others. PJT also added about a half-dozen bankers from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS Group AG, expanding the firm to 330 employees. That rivals all but the biggest boutiques. Of course, there\u2019s Taubman himself. While overseeing M&A in various roles at Morgan Stanley from 2003 through 2012, the bank worked on more than $6 trillion of deals. His deft maneuvers to salvage the Pfizer deal during the credit crisis impressed even the likes of Roger Altman, the long-time dealmaker who co-founded Evercore. \u201cHe certainly has experience in running one of the largest M&A groups on the Street,\u201d said John Mack, who led Morgan Stanley during that time. Nevertheless, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows are you a good CEO or\u00a0a mediocre CEO until you put your team together, and then execute on it.\u201d For boutiques, satisfying shareholders can be particularly hard. Some, such as Evercore, have delivered outsized returns since 2009, but on average, boutiques lag behind the big banks. This year, Moelis & Co. and Greenhill & Co., formed by ex-Morgan Stanley banker Robert Greenhill, have fallen at least 25 percent as they missed earnings estimates. What\u2019s more, only one boutique, Lazard, has consistently ranked among the top 10 for M&A over the past decade. \u201cThe challenge is to build the firm at the same time that you\u2019re doing business -- and at a time when Paul himself will be the big draw,\u201d Altman said. PJT\u2019s first year as a public company could be its most difficult because it may need spend more to grow, said Jonathan Morgan, a deals analyst at The Edge. With compensation accounting for most of the expenses, the Blackstone businesses had a net loss of $23 million in the first half, a filing showed. If that holds, it would be the second loss in three years. Some are wondering whether Taubman is being too ambitious. A portion of his pay is tied to PJT shares that need to triple to $79 by\u00a0October 2019. That\u2019s a lofty goal as the stock has already traded at a higher price than warranted by the sum of its parts, Morgan said. \u201cIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if he can hit that,\u201d he said. Even if M&A does slow, Taubman still has Blackstone\u2019s restructuring group, and Park Hill, a fund adviser that\u2019s also being rolled into PJT, to potentially drive growth. As part of PJT, the restructuring bankers would be free from any conflicts that could arise if Blackstone\u2019s asset managers wanted to buy distressed debt or real estate. Park Hill could also win more work from other private-equity firms, which were\u00a0previously wary of working with the competition. In the past, Park Hill didn\u2019t introduce Blackstone\u2019s M&A team to its clients, which have been involved in some 4,000 investments since the fund\u2019s founding, according to\u00a0Dan Prendergast, the group\u2019s leader. Ultimately though, PJT\u2019s success may hinge as much on Taubman\u2019s ability to woo and reassure new clients -- a skill he cultivated in the 1980s as a young banker after attending Stanford Business School -- as it does on the legendary loyalty of his existing ones. And that\u2019s where the old flip phone comes in. \u201cIt\u2019s an intimate thing,\u201d Tim Coleman, who leads the restructuring business, said of the device and uses a similar one. \u201cIf you\u2019re calling somebody about the biggest transaction or bankruptcy of their life,\u201d he said, \u201cyou want to sound like you\u2019re sitting next to them.\u201d","timestamp":1443592801.0,"participant_ids":["BX:US","MS:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-30\/a-wall-street-rainmaker-s-secret-to-trillions-worth-of-m-a-deals","subject":"A Wall Street Rainmaker's Secret to Trillions Worth of M&A Deals"},{"body":" Microsoft Corp. is getting out of Web display advertising, with AOL Inc. taking over the business and letting the software maker focus on mobile and cloud computing. AOL will use Microsoft\u2019s Bing Internet search engine instead of Google Inc. as part of the 10-year deal, the companies said in a statement Monday. Microsoft also said it\u2019s expanding an ad partnership with AppNexus Inc., an online marketing company. AOL will hire about 1,200 Microsoft workers in display ad sales, marketing and engineering, according to Gerasimos Manolatos, a spokesman for AOL. AppNexus will take other Microsoft employees. Some remaining employees will be offered other jobs at Microsoft, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because specific details of the deal haven\u2019t been announced. Microsoft is shedding the business, which focuses on graphic ads such as banners and videos, as Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella works to sharpen focus on three key areas: personal computing, cloud platforms and business productivity. Since becoming CEO early last year, Nadella has been streamlining the workforce, acquiring mobile and cloud software makers, and paring units not central to his strategy. Separately, Microsoft said today that it\u2019s   part of the Bing maps unit to car-booking company Uber Technologies Inc. As part of that deal, Uber will offer jobs to about 100 Microsoft employees. Financial terms of the deals weren\u2019t immediately known. Microsoft unveiled a plan a year ago to eliminate as many 18,000 jobs, the largest round of cuts in its history as Nadella overhauls the software maker. Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, declined to comment on the workforce impact of the deal. The deal with AOL marks the end of a years-long, multibillion-dollar effort by Microsoft to profit from the display advertising market with its own unit. The company spent $6.3 billion in 2007 to buy AQuantive Inc. to build the business weeks after Google Inc. moved into the market with the purchase of DoubleClick. After several strategy shifts, execution failures and executive departures, Microsoft in 2012 was forced to write down almost the entire value of AQuantive. AOL, which was bought by Verizon Communications Inc. this month, will take over management and sales responsibility for all of Microsoft\u2019s display, mobile and video advertising inventory in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan, according to the statement. AOL will start using Bing as the search engine for its users from Jan. 1. Microsoft is splitting up the direct ad sales team on a country-by-country basis between AOL and AppNexus, said Michael Rubenstein, president of New York-based AppNexus. His programmatic advertising technology startup,\u00a0which automates buying and selling of ads online, will oversee sales in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland. \u201cAppNexus will be wholly responsible for ad revenue for Microsoft in those European countries,\u201d Rubenstein said in an interview.

AT&T is projected to boost sales faster than Verizon for the next 10 quarters, and it\u2019s about to close a satellite-TV acquisition that will make it the top pay-TV provider in the U.S. while helping it bore deeper into Latin America.

During that acquisition process, McAdam began a review of the company\u2019s legacy telephone assets, part of an effort to raise cash, pay down debt and buy wireless airwaves. Verizon has sold landline operations in three states and $15.6 billion worth of property rights to more than 11,000 cell towers. McAdam has said he doesn\u2019t share AT&T\u2019s interest in satellite TV. Last month Verizon bought AOL to enhance its ad-placement technology as it moves into mobile-video services. \u201cIf he had it his way, Lowell would make Verizon an all-wireless company,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s Fritzsche said. Verizon gets about 70 percent of its total revenue from wireless; AT&T gets 56 percent. The strength of Verizon\u2019s wireless-centric strategy will be under scrutiny Tuesday as the company reports second-quarter results. By dangling cheap tablets, Verizon will have added about 1 million new subscribers, according to a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts. AT&T, which reports results Thursday, is expected to have added less than half of that. Yet analysts also project an annual sales decline for Verizon. After reaching 3 percent top line growth this year, the pace slows to 1 percent next year and no growth in 2017. AT&T is estimated to rise from 3 percent sales growth this year to 4 percent next year and 3 percent in 2017. AT&T and Verizon had historically moved in tandem. They both started as regional phone companies that got bigger by buying other regional phone companies. They both added wireless units, then expanded into broadband and TV-service bundles. Now, with Verizon\u2019s takeover of AOL and AT&T\u2019s takeover of DirecTV, the two have split apart. As early as this month, Verizon will start an Internet-based, mobile-TV service featuring live shows, video on demand, original programming and sporting events for people to watch on phones, tablets and televisions. AT&T will continue to expand into Mexico and other parts of Latin America with its acquisitions earlier this year of Grupo Iusacell SA and Nextel Mexico. But not everyone on Wall Street sees AT&T supplanting Verizon. Todd Lowenstein, a money manager with Highmark Capital Management, says that of the two strategies, he likes Verizon\u2019s most. AT&T is responding to today\u2019s challenges with DirecTV while Verizon is targeting a long-range growth opportunity, he said. Verizon\u2019s strength is its wireless network, the platform necessary for exploring services like mobile video with both a subscription and ad-supported model, he said. Highmark holds positions in Verizon as part of its $16 billion in assets under management. \u201cI like their focused strategy of consolidating the Vodafone stake and taking a mobile-first approach to attacking the market,\u201d Lowenstein said of Verizon.","timestamp":1437402759.0,"participant_ids":["VZ:US","T:US","DTV:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-20\/at-t-s-directv-deal-seen-helping-laggard-finally-outpace-verizon","subject":"AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Deal Seen Helping Laggard Finally Outpace Verizon"},{"body":"Barclays Plc agreed to sell the indexing business built around former Lehman Brothers benchmarks to Bloomberg LP for about 520 million pounds ($781 million), as Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley speeds up disposals of unwanted assets. Barclays said it will post a 480 million-pound gain from selling the risk analytics and index solutions business, boosting its regulatory capital level by 0.1 percentage point, according to a statement Wednesday from the London-based bank. The deal needs antitrust approval and should be completed \u201cmid-2016,\u201d Barclays said. Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg News. The bank\u2019s indexes, such as the\u00a0Global Aggregate, are widely used as corporate bond benchmarks by portfolio managers. Much of the business was acquired in 2008, when Barclays absorbed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\u2019s North American unit. Staley, a 58-year-old veteran of JPMorgan Chase & Co., was hired by Chairman John McFarlane in October to accelerate the bank\u2019s restructuring and refocus on its most profitable British and U.S. businesses. \u201cThis transaction is further evidence of the good work we are doing in managing down our non-core assets so that shareholders can feel the full benefit of ownership of Barclays\u2019s well-performing core businesses,\u201d Staley said in the statement.

The wireless carrier hasn\u2019t made a formal proposal to AOL, and no agreement is imminent, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Speaking at a conference today, Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said the company isn\u2019t having \u201csignificant acquisition discussions\u201d and is more interested in partnerships with media companies and content providers, rather than buying them. \u201cAOL, along with lots of other media companies, are potential for us to do partnerships,\u201d McAdam said. Verizon is primarily interested in AOL\u2019s programmatic advertising technology -- the automated buying and selling of ads online -- which could be paired with a future online-video product, two of the people said. With a takeover it would also gain paying subscribers and Internet properties including the Huffington Post. AOL CEO Tim Armstrong has used digital-advertising acquisitions to transform it from the Internet portal once known for its \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail\u201d alerts. Verizon is seeking expertise in three areas: online content, mobile video and advertising, one person said, and a venture -- rather than a takeover -- would keep it focused in those areas. \u201cVerizon needs a digital response and AOL has shown the best strategic foresight of navigating the digital-video world,\u201d said Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Needham & Co. \u201cVerizon can buy or build that, but it\u2019s unlikely to build it fast enough.\u201d The company also has held talks with several of AOL\u2019s peers about how to bolster those businesses, one person said. AOL rose 3.4 percent to $46.25 a share in New York, giving the company a market value of about $3.6 billion. Verizon rose 1 percent to $47.04, for a market value of about $195 billion. Spokesmen for Verizon and AOL declined to comment. Researcher EMarketer Inc.   in July that mobile advertising would lead 2014\u2019s rise in total media ad spending in the U.S., with advertisers spending 83 percent more on tablets and smartphones than they did in 2013 -- an increase of $8.04 billion. Verizon is looking to catch up with AT&T Inc. as wireless providers enhance their offerings. AT&T last year struck a $48.5 billion deal to acquire satellite TV provider DirecTV. With a takeover, Verizon would also gain AOL\u2019s 2.3 million paying members, in addition to Internet brands TechCrunch and Engadget. It\u2019s unclear if Verizon is interested in those media properties, which draw more than   unique visitors a month, the fourth-most in the U.S., behind Google Inc., Yahoo Inc. and Facebook Inc., according to November data from researcher ComScore Inc. Once called America Online, AOL was one of the main portals through which people first accessed the Internet. Its trajectory peaked with a now-infamous $124 billion combination with Time Warner 15 years ago, after which it began losing customers to faster services from telephone and cable-television carriers. After years of losses the merger was unwound with a spinoff in late 2009. Some of AOL\u2019s members still use its dial-up Internet service, though the company is winding down that business. If Verizon acquired the New York-based company, it could continue that process and convert some of those customers to its   broadband service, one of the people said. Verizon is dedicating three executives to help develop a mobile-video service and integrate acquired technology, known as OnCue, from Intel Inc. last year and EdgeCast Networks Inc. in December 2013. AT&T and The Chernin Group announced a joint venture to acquire and develop online-video services in April 2014. Verizon is still paying off debt from buying Vodafone\u2019s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless last year for $130 billion, and the company is stockpiling cash to acquire wireless spectrum in an auction that began in November. Both could hamper the New York company\u2019s ability to make an acquisition, two people said. AOL CEO Armstrong\u2019s investments in ad technology have brought growth, with the promise of profits not far off. His largest transaction was 2013\u2019s $418 million purchase of Adap.tv Inc., which matches advertisers and video publishers through an exchange. The strategy is to make AOL a company advertisers use to automate their purchases of placements on websites and online videos across the Web. While ads are everywhere online, marketers have found it difficult to ensure their messages are getting in front of their ideal audiences, a dilemma AOL\u2019s technology is meant to address.

The 1927 Patek Philippe single-button chronograph was auctioned for almost five times the low end of its estimate range of 1 million francs ($1.08 million) to 2 million francs. The timepiece, featuring an aged off-white silvered dial and a pulsations scale for helping measure heartbeats, is just one of two produced, and the other is in Patek Phillipe\u2019s museum.

His latest deal may go the same way. Li\u2019s Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. offered a 2.3 percent discount when it bought Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. earlier this year. Investors got stakes in a larger conglomerate and a property spinoff -- holdings now worth 30 percent more than Hutchison stock before the reshuffle. That beat the benchmark index\u2019s 7.5 percent drop through Wednesday, as well as gains in every other large company trading in Hong Kong. The returns show why shareholders are cheering the tycoon\u2019s latest lowball deal: Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd.\u2019s Tuesday offer to buy out its $19 billion electricity arm, Power Assets Holdings Ltd., with stock valued at just 1.8 percent above the last close. Shares of the target jumped Wednesday by the most in almost seven years, while Cheung Kong Infrastructure gained the most since 2011, adding a combined $2 billion of market value. The merger could lead to higher dividends and will bring benefits over a six- to 12-month period, said Niklas Hageback, who helps oversee about $189 million at Valkyria Kapital Ltd. \u201cThey will squeeze out much more efficiencies, and that will be beneficial to the shareholders,\u201d said Hageback, who owns Power Assets shares and said he may buy more. \u201cIf you take it in a longer perspective, and we have a normal stock market environment, then this is also likely to outperform.\u201d Li is offering investors in Power Assets, which has an $8.7 billion cash hoard but declining return on equity, the chance to get stock in a company with faster earnings and dividend growth, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. The combined company will own and operate power utilities, waste management and highways in the U.K., Australia and China. Still, \u201cit won\u2019t be easy\u201d to get Power Assets investors\u2019 approval, given the low premium compared to other successful privatizations, Citigroup Inc. said Wednesday. The ratio between the two companies\u2019 share prices is near a historical low, and Cheung Kong Infrastructure has room to offer a 15 percent premium to Power Assets shareholders, according to Morgan Stanley. The 1.8 percent premium on offer trails the average 24.2 percent paid in utility acquisitions globally in the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Acquirers of Hong Kong-listed companies in the past five years offered an average 15.3 percent premium. Power Assets\u2019s independent shareholders can block the takeover if more than 10 percent of them vote against it. Other takeover deals by tycoons in Hong Kong have failed before. New World Development Ltd., controlled by the family of billionaire Cheng Yu-tung, last year didn\u2019t garner enough votes for its $2.4 billion attempt to buy its listed Chinese property unit. That\u2019s despite offering a 32 percent premium. In January last year, Glorious Property Holdings Ltd. shareholders rejected an offer by Chinese businessman Zhang Zhirong to take the developer private. Cheung Kong Infrastructure Chairman Victor Li said Tuesday that \u201cbigger is better\u201d in the infrastructure business, so the added heft will help it compete for investments globally. A larger market value gives it a better chance of becoming a constituent of Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark index, Citigroup analysts led by Pierre Lau wrote in a report Wednesday. The new company would also have a bigger free float, as control by the Li family drops to just under 50 percent from 75.7 percent before the merger. The offer comes after a 42 percent jump in Cheung Kong Infrastructure shares over the past three years, outpacing the 6.4 percent gain in Power Assets and 7.4 percent rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. \u201cThe small premium is just short term, but if you\u2019re looking at medium to long term the consolidation will bring synergy effects,\u201d said Linus Yip, a Hong Kong-based strategist at First Shanghai Securities Ltd. \u201cWe are encountering difficult times as the global economy is losing steam.

Samsung used patented designs and two features of the Apple iPhone in older models of its devices, a U.S. appeals court ruled in upholding about $548 million in damages for the Cupertino, California-based company.  The court said the iPhone\u2019s appearance that Apple sought to protect is as much about function as beauty, and isn\u2019t eligible for perpetual coverage under U.S. trademark law. That could strip about $382 million from the original judgment.  The two smartphone makers have ended their global patent battles except for the issue decided Monday and a second case, also before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  Adam Yates, a spokesman for Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  \u201cWe are pleased the Federal Circuit Court of Appeal confirmed Samsung blatantly copied Apple products,\u201d Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman, said in a statement.

Samsung Electronics Co., 11-cv-1846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  A professor at Ohio\u2019s Youngstown State University received a patent on an invention that can potentially reduce the weight of solar panels and prevent wind damage.  Patent 9,003,739 covers a solar panel wind deflector. According to the patent, rooftop-mounted solar panels are typically placed at a 30-degree angle to the top of a flat roof, where their shape and thickness can create problems when the wind blows. These problems include lift, drag, movement, noise, and increased resistance that can, in time, cause the panels to become unstable and even pull loose from their mountings.  The wind deflector has a curved convex surface configured to meet the wind before aerodynamic forces hit the panel. The deflector can take the shape of a parabola, according to the patent.  The university said in a statement Monday that the deflector can help resolve \u201cone of the biggest issues facing the solar panel industry today.\u201d The invention will make the installation of roof panels safer and more economical, the school said.  The application for the patent, which was filed in June 2012, was handled by Fay Sharpe LLP of Cleveland, Ohio.  For more patent news, click here.  Google Inc., joined by broadcasters and free-speech advocates, beat back an actress\u2019s bid to block her appearance in a controversial online video and avoided a ruling it warned would make \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d of copyright law.  Cindy Lee Garcia was \u201cbamboozled\u201d into appearing in an anti-Muslim film which stoked violent protests when it was made public in 2012, a federal appeals court ruled. Nevertheless, the court declined to block the video while her lawsuit proceeds.  Garcia said she should be granted an injunction because of her independent copyright interest in her performance in \u201cInnocence of Muslims.\u201d Google warned that such a ruling would upend the entertainment industry. The court agreed.  \u201cGarcia\u2019s theory can be likened to \u2018copyright cherry-picking,\u2019 which would enable any contributor from a costume designer down to an extra or best boy to claim copyright in random bits and pieces of a unitary motion picture,\u201d U.S. Circuit Judge M. Margaret McKeown wrote for the majority.  The decision by the San Francisco-based court reversed an earlier holding in Garcia\u2019s favor. That ruling triggered an outcry by Internet companies including Netflix Inc. and Twitter Inc., who joined in Google\u2019s case.  Garcia had sued Google after the Mountain View, California-based company refused to take down the 14-minute clip showing a fictional attack by Muslims on a Christian family. The video sparked riots in the Middle East and caused an Egyptian cleric to call for everyone involved in the movie to be killed.

Those groups have claimed that owners of their vehicles don\u2019t own the software that underlies their operating systems.

Wagner\u2019s company last year began shifting away from pricey products from Oracle and International Business Machines Corp., replacing them with open-source software, which is freely available and can be modified. Now, Wagner said the closely held company is converting virtually all of its operations to free database software. \u201cThey scale and operate extremely well and they don\u2019t cost anything,\u201d Wagner said. Other companies share Wagner\u2019s view and are shifting to software whose code is public. While the threat to Oracle has been around for years, it\u2019s becoming more intense with recent improvements that make open-source technology more reliable -- and appealing to a new generation of multibillion-dollar startups, said  , an analyst at Gartner Inc. \u201cThere was pessimism for a decade on whether those things could stand up. The question is largely resolved,\u201d she said. \u201cThis open source, this open core model, is something we\u2019re going to see growing and growing through the years.\u201d The impact shows up in Oracle\u2019s sales of new software licenses, which have declined for seven straight quarters compared with the period a year earlier. New licenses made up 25 percent of total revenue in fiscal 2014, down from 28 percent a year earlier -- a sign the company is becoming increasingly dependent on revenue from supporting and maintaining products at existing customers and having a harder time finding new business. Oracle reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings next week. To blunt this, the Redwood City, California-based company is expanding efforts in cloud computing, which will let it sell packaged high-margin services to customers. That may help balance the slowdown in the basic business. It also operates an open-source database called MySQL. \u201cDoes the cloud-related business grow quickly enough to offset any long-term weakness in new software licenses? To us the answer is yes,\u201d said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co., who has a buy rating on Oracle. \u201cI would expect to see Oracle continue to gain market share within the cloud.\u201d Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, declined to comment. Companies contemplating a move away from traditional database sellers such as Oracle have essentially two options: hire internal engineers to corral various free open-source databases, or pay the startups behind the free technologies for some must-have features. Licensing Oracle\u2019s database can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on which of its   customers choose to use. One of the open-source technologies is the Cassandra database, which was created last decade and has been widely used by companies such as Apple Inc. and Netflix Inc. Though some companies develop and run Cassandra themselves, others go to the main backer, the startup DataStax Inc., for technical features they may not have the expertise to develop themselves. DataStax, for example, has a customer that paid about $500,000 in Oracle software licenses and now spends $90,000 with DataStax for a similar project, said Matt Pfeil, DataStax\u2019s co-founder. That price difference has started to have a major effect in the industry. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been in this industry too long to use Oracle,\u201d says Kellan Elliott-McCrea, chief technology officer of Etsy Inc. \u201cI saw so many of my peers in the late \u201990s crashing and burning and spending all of their money on Oracle.\u201d Instead, Etsy, an online marketplace for hand-crafted goods, runs on a hodge-podge of open-source databases, primarily MySQL. Not all applications are well-suited to open source, as the systems made by Oracle and others still have capabilities far in excess of the free systems, Palanca said. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to have a class of applications for which these open-source solutions are not yet ready, and that is the continued sweet spot for Oracle,\u201d she said. Even some really big customers are finding ways to increase their reliance on upstarts. Open source is changing the type of technologies Goldman Sachs Group Inc. deploys in systems relating to messaging and databases, said Don Duet, the co-head of technology at Goldman Sachs. Many of these technologies became \u201cstandard parts\u201d of Goldman\u2019s computing infrastructure in the last two years, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to go into our datacenter and see a tremendous amount of open source running our applications and middleware,\u201d he said. Goldman Sachs recently invested in a funding round for MongoDB Inc., another open source database provider. A Bloomberg survey of 20 startups valued at more than $1 billion supports the trend. The survey, which included companies such as Cloudflare Inc. and Pinterest Inc., found they placed open-source technologies at the heart of their businesses, with the exception of DocuSign, which had built around Microsoft\u2019s SQL Server. None of the companies surveyed indicated they had a large Oracle database deployment for their main services, though many used bits of Oracle software to run aspects of their organizations. Uber Technologies Inc., the car service, has committed heavily to Oracle via a worldwide rollout of the company\u2019s E-Business Suite software, but job listings and presentations by Uber employees indicate it relies on a customized version of the free MySQL for its software. \u201cA lot of the startups now go with MySQL or less expensive options,\u201d said David Wolff, the CEO of Database Specialists, a database consultancy. \u201cThe only thing that people complain about with Oracle is how much it costs.\u201d Companies can pay Oracle to get extra features of MySQL for $2,000 to $10,000 per computer it runs on, but none of the companies indicated this was the case.

As open-source databases continue to improve, there may be less reason to pay for Oracle\u2019s products. \u201cI think more and more organizations are starting to realize the reason Oracle is charging that much is because there\u2019s incredibly sophisticated technology in Oracle,\u201d Palanca said. \u201cOrganizations are realizing they don\u2019t need that for everything anymore.\u201d","timestamp":1434013200.0,"participant_ids":["ORCL:US","0211417Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-11\/oracle-sales-eroded-as-startups-embrace-souped-up-free-software","subject":"Oracle Sales Erode as Startups Embrace Souped-Up Free Software"},{"body":"     (Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co. is countering a patent lawsuit set to go to trial in Tacoma, Washington, with trade-secret misappropriation claims.  The suit, filed in June 2011, pits a Washington patent holder against Ford and involves patents covering a system that permits drivers to connect mobile devices to a vehicle.  Eagle Harbor Holdings LLC of Bainbridge Island has accused Ford of infringing seven patents, and now the automaker is claiming that Eagle Harbor made unauthorized use of information about Ford\u2019s cars to obtain its patents.  U.S. District Judge Benjamin J. Settle last month denied Eagle Harbor\u2019s request to dismiss the trade-secret claims. He rejected Eagle Harbor\u2019s argument that the confidential information at issue wasn\u2019t really a trade secret and that Ford failed to show how Eagle Harbor got the information.  In a second ruling, Settle narrowed some of the claims against Ford, rejecting Eagle Harbor\u2019s claim that the infringement was deliberate along with one of the theories of infringement that company as advancing.  In a March 3 order, he gave the parties 20 hours each to make their case.  The case is Eagle Harbor Holdings LLC v. Ford Motor Co., 11-cv-05503, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington (Tacoma).  A challenge by Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. to a patent on which Jeff Bezos is the lead inventor received a positive ruling from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  At issue is patent 8,678,321, which was issued in March 2014. It covers the sea landing of space launch vehicles and is aimed at re-using rocket elements, instead of discarding them during flight as is usually done. Re-using launch vehicles would make space travel cheaper.  According to the patent, a structure would be positioned in a body of water and the launch vehicle returning to Earth would land tail-first on it.  The patent was issued to Blue Origin LLC of Kent, Washington, a company established by Bezos, the chairman of Amazon.com Inc.  In a March 3 decision, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board said that Musk\u2019s Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX demonstrated a reasonable likelihood that it would prevail in showing the unpatentability of one of the patent claims.  The board agreed with SpaceX that some of the claims in the patent under review had been anticipated by and were obvious in the light of a technical paper, \u201cRe-entry and Terminal Guidance for Vertical Landing TSTO (Two-Stage to Orbit),\u201d presented at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1998.  The application for the disputed patent was filed in June 2010.  The board ruled that a procedure known as an inter parties review could be conducted over this patent.

U.S. Releases List of \u2018Notorious Markets\u2019 for Counterfeit Goods  The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative released its latest list of so-called notorious markets, identifying sites that cause \u201csignificant financial losses\u201d for U.S. companies to piracy and other forms of intellectual property infringement.  The 2014 survey identified physical marketplaces in 10 countries where significant amounts of counterfeit goods are sold. The markets are in Argentina, Brazil, China, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Paraguay, Thailand and Uruguay.  Particular areas of concern are Argentina\u2019s La Salada, which the report identified as South America\u2019s largest black market; the Silk Market in Beijing, where vendors  reportedly have access \u201cto a supply of newly manufactured counterfeit products to replace those that have been confiscated\u201d; the Harco Gladok market in Jakarta, listed as Indonesia\u2019s largest trade center for consumer electronics and related goods; and the Computer Village Market in Lagos, Nigeria, reportedly the largest market for knockoff computer products and accessories in the nation.  China is the source of many of the counterfeit goods sold in markets in Prado, Italy; Lagos; Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, and Bangkok, according to the report.  The report lists a number of websites where enforcement activities have cut down on the quantity of counterfeit goods sold, including Seriesyonkis.com, Aiseesoft.com, Xunlei.com, and wawa-mania.ec, Mp3skull.com and Share-rapid.cz.

A U.K. blogger who was the subject of a Digital Millennium Copyright Act claim after he posted a press release sent to him by an organization advocating heterosexual rights won a default judgment in a California federal court.  Oliver Hotham, identified in court papers as a student journalist and blogger, publishes a blog on the WordPress.com website operated by San Francisco\u2019s Automattic Inc.  After reading a news account of Straight Pride UK, he contacted the organization, identifying himself as a student and freelance journalist, and asked for information about the organization, according to his pleadings.  The organization sent him a press release, which Hotham published in part on his blog. That same day, the self-described press officer for Straight Pride sent takedown notices to Hotham and Automattic, claiming copyright infringement.  Hotham sued in federal court in Oakland, California, in November 2013, accusing the press officer of misrepresentation of copyright.  In her March 2 order, U.S. District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton granted a default judgment and awarded damages, including attorney fees, of $25,084.  She said Hotham and Automattic have been unsuccessfully attempting to locate the press officer, Nick Steiner, in order to serve the recommendations of a federal magistrate judge with respect to the default judgment. She said the court would require no further expenditure of resources.  The report from U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph Sero was filed Oct. 6. He recommended that Steiner be found to have made material misrepresentations in filing a DMCA infringement complaint.  The case is Automattic Inc. v. Steiner, 13-cv-05413, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).  Kim Dotcom and his co-defendants in a criminal copyright case have no standing to contest the forfeiture of their assets, a federal court in Virginia ruled.  Dotcom is in New Zealand, fighting attempts to have him extradited to the U.S. to face the charges. The case is related to websites the government claims facilitated unauthorized file-sharing.  U.S. District Judge Liam O\u2019Grady ruled Feb. 27 that because Dotcom and other co-defendants are fugitives, they can\u2019t contest the forfeiture. He said the government successfully invoked a U.S. law that bars such actions. The law, he said, was enacted to prevent the \u201cunseemly\u201d spectacle of a fugitive criminal defendant who is facing both incarceration and forfeiture from attempting to invoke \u201cfrom a safe distance only so much of a U.S. court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d to recover alleged criminal proceeds.  According to court papers, the government is seeking the forfeiture of 18 bank accounts in Hong Kong and New Zealand; Dotcom\u2019s assets in Computershare Investor Services Ltd.; two luxury homes in Auckland; 21 cars, including Mercedes Benzes and Cadillacs; one Dutch Angel motorcycle; four personal watercraft; a 108-inch television set; three 82-inch TVs; a Devon Works Tread #1 watch that costs upwards of $27,000; and a photo by Olaf Mueller.  In January, in the same case the government argued in a court filing that Dotcom\u2019s estranged wife has no standing to claim half her husband\u2019s assets.  The civil case is U.S. v. All Assets Listed in Attachment A, 14-cv-00969; and the criminal case is U.S. v. Dotcom, 12-cr-00003, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria).

It seemed in\u00a0recent\u00a0months that the battle lines were becoming clear as competing headsets were being built by Facebook-owned Oculus, HTC and Valve, Sony, and Microsoft, with the first commercial\u00a0release\u00a0dates set for 2016. Now Microsoft has suddenly thrown in its lot with Oculus.\u00a0 Oculus held a press conference on\u00a0Thursday\u00a0to fill in a few key details about the headsets. The company said it would begin selling the devices by the end of March 2016, announced a $10 million fund to help independent developers make Oculus games, and demonstrated prototype controllers that\u00a0players\u00a0will hold in each hand to navigate\u00a0virtual environments. Brendan Iribe, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said that the headsets will ship with Xbox controllers, and he described how Oculus will have a\u00a0\u201ctight integration with Windows\u201d. He said\u00a0players will be able to stream Xbox One games onto the Oculus headsets.\u00a0 It\u2019s not yet clear how developments in the virtual reality industry will play out.\u00a0Customers and developers have yet to cast their votes as to which headset should win. Tim Merel, managing director of Digi-Capital, a firm that advises companies on augmented and virtual reality, says the\u00a0current landscape\u00a0\u201cfeels a bit like the smartphone market\u00a0before\u00a0the iPhone.\u201d A\u00a0collaboration\u00a0with Microsoft could tip the scales further in Oculus\u2019s favor. Developers tend to want to build applications for the widest possible audiences, and Microsoft\u2019s audience\u00a0will be a big draw.\u00a0 For Microsoft, Oculus allows a way into virtual reality without having to do a lot of heavy lifting. If Oculus takes off, Microsoft shares in the success. If it doesn\u2019t, Microsoft won't\u00a0have much on the line. A significant prize would be a boost in the gaming console market. The Xbox One has been trailing Sony's Playstation since they were introduced in late 2013. But while the companies say gamers will be able to stream Xbox one games on the Oculus headset, this isn't quite the same thing as turning Oculus into Xbox's version of Sony's Morpheus, a virtual reality device designed to work directly with the console.\u00a0 In essence, the\u00a0partnership with Oculus is a way for Microsoft to hedge its bet. Earlier this year the company unveiled HoloLens, based on the related but distinct technology known as augmented reality. While virtual\u00a0reality\u00a0blocks your\u00a0senses to place you in a new world, augmented reality allows you to stay in the real world while seeing digital imagery integrated into reality. Virtual reality is something that the entire hardcore gaming\u00a0industry\u00a0has jumped at, but Microsoft is currently the only big player working on augmented reality.\u00a0 Ed Fries, the former Microsoft\u00a0executive\u00a0who led the creation of the Xbox, thinks the HoloLens could offers Microsoft a way\u00a0to gain ground on Playstation.\u00a0\u201cMaybe AR will really win in a big way over VR because people want to see while they wear this thing on their heads,\u201d\u00a0he says.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a potential wild card.\u201d\u00a0Sony is\u00a0planning\u00a0to use next week\u2019s E3 conference in Los Angeles to\u00a0discuss\u00a0its own plans for virtual reality; Xbox hasn\u2019t confirmed\u00a0whether it will show off the HoloLens at the show.\u00a0 Merel of\u00a0Digi-Capital thinks augmented reality could end up being a more important technology than virtual reality because it is inherently more portable than a headset that completely blocks your natural vision. His company forecasts that augmented reality could be a  , with VR topping out at $30 billion and being more\u00a0tightly\u00a0focused on gaming and 3D entertainment.\u00a0 Virtual reality does have the advantage of being first. Elijah Freeman, the executive producer of German gaming developer Crytek is currently working on virtual reality games, but hasn't started\u00a0in\u00a0on augmented reality. The appeal of virtual reality is that \"so many systems are about to launch,\" \u00a0says Freeman, so his team has already developed some competency with the medium. \"None of that necessarily diminishes our interest in AR, it's just that we'll have to wait a little longer until we can explore the possibilities on that front,\" he says. Oculus allows Microsoft to hold developers' attention while HoloLens plays catch up.\u00a0 \u00a0Microsoft\u2019s partnership with Oculus also gives it more flexibility to experiment with HoloLens as something\u00a0more than a gaming device. While the Xbox seems a natural fit for a gaming headset, HoloLens didn\u2019t come out of the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0gaming division, and it didn\u2019t show off any Xbox tie-ins when it first   in January. (It did show how\u00a0augmented\u00a0reality could be used to turn your living room into a setting for the game Minecraft.) Microsoft\u00a0has been careful to keep its non-gaming ambitions from leaking into its plans for Xbox because\u00a0it encountered significant\u00a0backlash when it tried to position the Xbox One as a general entertainment tool. By making Oculus the de facto virtual reality headset for its hardcore\u00a0gaming customers, Microsoft can build the HoloLens as a tool for office workers and electricians without making anyone too mad.\u00a0","timestamp":1434047739.0,"participant_ids":["MSFT:US","6758:JP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-11\/microsoft-and-oculus-are-teaming-up-on-playstation","subject":"Microsoft\u00a0and Oculus Are Ganging\u00a0Up\u00a0on Playstation"},{"body":" Oracle Corp. announced a new data center hardware strategy that lowers the prices of its products to increase adoption of its software. Chairman Larry Ellison announced the fifth generation of the company\u2019s suite of engineered systems products on Wednesday at an event at Oracle\u2019s headquarters in Redwood City, California. The new products, pairing Oracle\u2019s self-designed hardware and software, will compete with systems from traditional vendors such as Cisco Systems Inc. and EMC Corp. by being priced lower than the competition, Ellison said. \u201cOur new strategy is highest performance, lowest list price, best cost performance,\u201d Ellison said. The new products continue Oracle\u2019s strategy of tightly coupling hardware with software to foster long-term customers. While the hardware division produced just 14 percent of Oracle\u2019s $38.3 billion in 2014 fiscal year revenue, the company typically uses the machines to bundle in its enterprise software, providing a boost to total sales. \u201cCustomers are just more satisfied when they run our engineered systems, so that will tend to produce repeat customers both on the hardware and the software side,\u201d Juan Loaiza, senior vice president of Oracle\u2019s Systems Technology division, told analysts and reporters after the event. Cisco said its alliance with EMC in the \u201cconverged infrastructure\u201d market has made it the No. 1 vendor. \u201cOracle has a lot of catching up to do,\u201d said Paul Perez, a vice president at Cisco. A representative for EMC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Oracle has invested in more products that tie its hardware to software, creating a loose classification of \u201cengineered systems.\u201d Sales of those systems rose in the \u201cdouble digits\u201d last quarter, Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd said in a December conference call. Oracle is the world\u2019s largest database software company and one of the biggest providers of business programs. Today\u2019s event is the company\u2019s first substantial new product unveiling since Ellison stepped down as CEO last September. Hurd and Safra Catz were promoted to CEOs. Oracle declined about 1 percent to $43.49 at the close in New York before Ellison\u2019s presentation and was little changed in extended trading.

Now, with personal-computer demand in decline and companies flocking to the cloud to run their operations, she\u2019s on board with a split taking place next week.\u00a0The chief executive\u2019s biggest job: proving to customers, investors and employees that a smaller, enterprise-focused HP will be faster and more nimble against competitors. To get there, analysts recommend that Whitman deepen HP\u2019s expertise in such areas as security and data analytics, including through smaller, strategic acquisitions. Another area for improvement is catering to customers who do more business over mobile devices. Whitman\u2019s split-up plan stands in contrast to Michael Dell\u2019s $67 billion deal to combine Dell Inc. with storage-maker EMC Corp. in the largest-ever technology merger. He\u2019s betting that a single provider of enterprise computing technology will be stronger because it can offer everything a company might need to run its business under a single roof. HP is poised to benefit should the merger prove distracting for managers at the enlarged Dell-EMC. \"It\u2019s quite unusual that you end up with companies that have taken such different approaches,\" Whitman said in a recent interview. \"Given the market, given the changes that are afoot here, you\u2019re better off being smaller, more nimble.\" Ever since she took over as Hewlett-Packard\u2019s CEO, Whitman has had to come to\u00a0grips\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0company\u00a0whose size was out of sync with demand for its products. Much of her four-year tenure has been spent scaling back investor expectations, cutting more than 80,000 jobs and, ultimately, turning the company founded in a Palo Alto, California, garage into two smaller versions of its former self. One will be Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or HPE, led by Whitman and focused on servers, high-end software and services. The other, called HP Inc., will include printers and computers. Both will start trading separately on Monday. Whitman, along with Dion Weisler, who will run HP Inc., will need to move swiftly to assuage investors who lost patience with once mighty Hewlett-Packard, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. \"The window of opportunity is closing,\" Ives said. \"This is a pivotal period of time over the next six to nine months for these companies to get their act together and show that there\u2019s a pulse.\" Already, investors are giving early signals on prospects for both new companies, based on \"when issued\" shares that have been trading in advance of the split. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is trading above $15, topping HP Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When a large company splits up, exchanges usually authorize preliminary trading to determine pricing and limit volatility. Preparations for the transition have been under way for several months -- ensuring everything from office space to internal technology systems were separated in time. The separation is a complicated task involving more than 300,000 employees, offices across the globe and a network of partnerships forged since the company was founded in 1939. Last week, Whitman said she did something that hasn\u2019t happened before: She spent an entire day on a three-year plan for its key server business, without any talk about inkjet printers or what should be done to sell more PCs. \"There\u2019s a great deal to be said for focus,\" Whitman said. \"You\u2019ve got to be on it. You\u2019ve got to be working on the product road map.\" But in the server space, Dell is waiting. With EMC, it gets the No. 1 provider of storage gear, making it a one-stop shop for corporate customers. If Dell\u2019s strategy works, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will just continue the former HP\u2019s fate, where sales have declined for 15 of the past 16 quarters. PC shipments, where HP is No. 2, fell   in the third quarter, according to Gartner Inc. For servers, where Hewlett-Packard is the market leader, second-quarter shipments slowed to 8 percent from 13 percent in the prior period. A key challenge for HP has been the rise of cloud-computing services. Amazon.com Inc. and more recently Microsoft Corp. have become market leaders in letting corporations access computer and storage services over the Internet. While Hewlett-Packard had its own public-cloud service, it never got enough traction -- and last week the company said it would shut it down. Still, HP said it\u2019s investing in other ways to provide cloud services through a hybrid approach. \"I think that game has played out,\" Whitman said, referring to Microsoft and Amazon. \"I think those are going to be the two winners in the public cloud.\" The cloud shutdown was a \"telling moment,\" said Todd Lowenstein, director of research at Highmark Capital Management, which has HP shares among its holdings. \"They have some catch-up to do.\" Acquisitions will probably be part of any effort to expand the product line. To bolster data security, Hewlett Packard Enterprise could consider Redwood Shores, California-based Imperva Inc., said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC. Whitman didn\u2019t discuss specific targets, though when asked about deal size, she pointed to past acquisitions in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, including 3Par, 3Com, and Aruba Networks. Whitman showed less appetite for deals in the tens of billions. \"It\u2019s just hard to imagine you would do a transformation acquisition\" of tens of billions of dollars, after de-leveraging the company\u2019s debt in the past few years, she said. Weisler is also open to acquisitions, although he predicted there would be fewer of those compared with Hewlett Packard Enterprise. He said he\u2019s looking forward to investing in HP Inc. \"This was a natural, logical separation,\" he said. \"There is opportunity for growth.\" Whatever else they do to chase growth, HP is on record as saying it will seek to make hay while Dell and EMC knit together their sprawling operations. \"Two of our largest competitors are attempting a highly distracting, multiyear merger, just as we are launching two new, focused companies,\" Hewlett-Packard said when Dell-EMC was announced. \"While Dell and EMC are sorting out their future, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will be working to take share.\"","timestamp":1446188400.0,"participant_ids":["HPQ:US","EMC:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-30\/meg-whitman-bets-smaller-hp-will-be-agile-enough-to-take-on-dell","subject":"Whitman Readies Slimmed-Down HP for Duel With Bulked-Up Dell"},{"body":" Hewlett-Packard Co. said it would sell its Snapfish photo-sharing site to  , part of the computer maker\u2019s plan to refocus operations as it splits in two.

A group owned by the Chinese university, Tsinghua Holdings, will purchase the 51 percent stake in a new business called H3C. The deal values the businesses at $4.5 billion net of cash and debt, the companies said Thursday in a statement. China has been encouraging the use of local suppliers and aims to purge most foreign technology from the country\u2019s banks, military and government enterprises by 2020, people with knowledge of the matter said in December. By selling control of the businesses to Chinese investors, Hewlett-Packard seeks to win sales to state-owned companies.

So how come the world\u2019s most richly valued automaker took four years to shift the number of cars that General Motors sells in three days? To be sure, Tesla Motors recognizes this flaw, and has ambitious plans to lift annual production almost 16-fold to 500,000 cars a year by 2020. This week, founder Elon Musk unveiled the Model X, an SUV that Tesla promises   with luxury conventional-fuel models, and by 2018 he plans to be selling a mass-market car costing $35,000. But the bigger news for electric cars came out of Beijing a few hours before the first Model X left Tesla\u2019s factory: China\u2019s   to dedicate 30 percent of their fleet purchases to new energy vehicles, and threatened to cut fuel and operating subsidies to those that fall short. That prompted a two-day gain of as much as 14 percent in Hong Kong-traded shares of BYD, the country\u2019s biggest maker of electric and plug-in hybrid cars. The stock is now up 44 percent since its low point in the wake of China\u2019s stock-market crash, but in valuation terms it\u2019s still a snip compared with Tesla: We\u2019ve handicapped BYD here by basing the comparison on the 2016 fiscal year, when analysts expect Tesla to start making a profit, and by dividing the price-earnings ratio by income growth to allow for Tesla\u2019s rapid start-up phase. BYD\u2019s price-earnings-to-growth, or PEG, ratio of 0.7 makes it cheap compared with the rule of thumb that equates a score of 1 to fair value. Tesla\u2019s 8.2 looks outrageously expensive. So why is the market wild on Tesla and only lukewarm on BYD? Well, investors have long memories, and the Chinese company\u2019s new-energy vehicles business has been a perennial disappointment since Warren Buffett took a 10 percent stake in 2008. In 2013, BYD sold just 2,691 units, about 12 percent of Tesla\u2019s output that year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. That laggard performance is now changing: Subsidies and local government purchases helped China\u2019s electric-vehicle sales surge 2.4 times in the first half, with BYD claiming a 43 percent market share, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With municipalities still well short of their year-end purchasing target\u00a0and Beijing waving the stick of subsidy cuts, it should easily overtake its American competitor in second-half volumes. Whereas Tesla makes an operating loss on every car it builds, BYD makes everything from conventional-fuel cars to mobile-phone batteries to utility-scale energy storage. That gives it a healthy operating income to plow into its electric-car unit, whereas Musk has to depend on equity and credit markets for growth capital: Tesla has one key advantage -- clearly superior technology. BYD\u2019s best-selling Qin can travel only\u00a070 kilometers on one charge before its gasoline back-up engine has to kick in, about a sixth of the battery range of Tesla\u2019s Model S. But this comes at a cost: Chinese municipalities could get five Qins for the price of one Model S,\u00a0thanks in part to subsidies that reduce the local model\u2019s price tag to 126,800 yuan ($20,000). Government support can be a double-edged sword, leaving its beneficiaries too weak to compete if it\u2019s ever withdrawn. There are plenty of global carmakers with far more lavish research and development budgets that would like to make money out of new-energy vehicles in the world\u2019s biggest car market: Still, technology isn\u2019t everything in the car industry.

An environmental group, the International Council on Clean Transportation, had asked the school\u2019s Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines and Emissions to test the tailpipes of diesel cars in the U.S., such as those sold by Volkswagen and BMW. Studies suggested that automakers\u2019 diesel cars polluted more on the road than in the lab, and curiously, more in Europe than in the U.S. ICCT wanted to figure out what the automakers had done to meet America\u2019s tougher emissions standards and how to repatriate these improvements for European car buyers. The center, founded in 1989, is based on the rolling WVU campus in the foothills of Appalachia and occupies a warehouselike space full of young men in T-shirts and jeans fiddling with jury-rigged equipment, and it smells like a gas station. Run by  , a West Virginia native, it mostly tests heavy-duty engines for trucks and locomotives. Taking sleek passenger cars\u00a0on a road trip was a novelty. One student at the lab, Marc Besch, thought it sounded interesting and asked to work on the project. Besch grew up in Switzerland, and his family ran a dealership that sold mostly Opels, a German competitor to Volkswagen. There was one problem: Carder, Besch, and their team couldn\u2019t find any diesel cars in West Virginia. So they plotted test routes in California, where lots of consumers have bought into the marketing promise of \u201cclean diesel,\u201d which touts remarkable fuel efficiency without sacrificing muscular acceleration. Out west, they could also use the California Air Resources Board\u2019s dynamometers, the hulking apparatuses used to measure the exhaust coming out of a stationary car. From February through April 2013, they tested three diesel cars: a Volkswagen Jetta, a Volkswagen Passat, and a BMW SUV. Besch took charge of the initial assessment, using the dynos, and he was impressed. The cars emitted almost nothing, prompting some crowing from Besch about European engineering. When Besch\u2019s fellow investigator, Arvind Thiruvengadam, joined him to take the cars on the road, however, the results were different. The road tests captured a variety of conditions: high elevations up Mt. Baldy; stop-and-go urban errand-running in San Diego; freeway driving around Los Angeles. The two Volkswagens\u2019 emissions exceeded standards by 5 to 35 times. The BMW\u2019s didn\u2019t. First, they assumed the results were wrong, so the team recalibrated the instruments and kept on driving. Eventually they realized that, yes, they were seeing something noteworthy, if not exactly shocking. What comes out of a tailpipe on the road is always going to differ somewhat from regulatory targets met in tightly controlled environments. Speed, elevation, and temperature all affect the result. To isolate the cause, Besch pored over a two-part paper, published by Volkswagen\u2019s top engineers in 2008, that described purportedly groundbreaking emissions control achieved by the new TDI 2.0 liter engine. And he pursued a theory related to the exhaust filtering system. He still couldn\u2019t explain the full extent of the emissions. \u201cWe thought the vehicles would be clean. We had no cause for suspicion.\u201d On March 31, 2014, Besch, Carder, and the rest of the WVU researchers presented their findings in San Diego, at the most important conference in the car-exhaust field, the Real World Emissions Workshop. They didn\u2019t name which cars they\u2019d tested, but the technical specs and use of the Lean NOx capture system meant it could only be a Volkswagen. Sitting in the audience was Jens Borken-Kleefeld, who studies emissions at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. He\u2019d made the trip for the same reason ICCT had commissioned its study: to understand why the diesel technologies seemed to be cleaner in the U.S. than in Europe. Borken-Kleefeld says the U.S. audience seemed to miss the significance of the findings. \u201cFor me, it was a big deal,\u201d he says. \u201cI was expecting to see \u2018clean diesel\u2019\u2014and I realized that on the other side of the pond, it\u2019s the same technology and the same underperformance.\u201d U.S. regulators were also in the room, and Borken-Kleefeld recalls approaching some of them. \u201cThey shrugged their shoulders,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they knew at the time\u2014seeing and realizing is different.\u201d Volkswagen, at least, took note. Someone from VW got in touch with the team to get more details. Carder tried to get Volkswagen interested in a follow-up study with more cars, but it never happened. Early this year, engineers from VW\u2019s Oxnard test facility called to discuss the routes WVU used. (Besch declined to provide names of the engineers.) And that was pretty much it. Which was normal\u2014carmakers regularly learn of emissions problems from researchers and quietly make fixes. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything more from them, so we fully assumed that they had made some recalls,\u201d says Carder. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even talk to our friends at [California] ARB to follow up on it. That\u2019s really how confident we were that they\u2019d have fixed this, that it was going to be a nonissue.\u201d What the West Virginia team didn\u2019t realize was that they\u2019d exposed one of the   deceptions in the history of the auto industry. On Sept. 3, 2015, VW admitted to U.S. and California regulators that it had not only been selling high-polluting cars but that it had deliberately outfitted them with \u201cdefeat devices\u201d that sensed when an official emissions test was under way and temporarily trapped the worst of the exhaust\u2014chemicals that contribute to smog and acid rain. \u201cDevice,\u201d actually, is something of a misnomer. The cheat is merely several lines of software code in the computer that controls a Volkswagen\u2019s engine and exhaust systems. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, when the car detects a test\u2014certain steering patterns; speed; barometric pressure; only two wheels spinning instead of four\u2014it switches into a cleaner mode called \u201cdyno calibration,\u201d after the testing machines. The cars can run cleaner, but they can\u2019t run cleaner without sacrificing fuel efficiency or some of the engine\u2019s power. The FBI has opened a criminal probe, and an investigation by the EPA could result in as much as $18 billion in penalties, compounding the immediate loss of tens of billions of dollars in Volkswagen\u2019s market value. On Oct. 8, more than 50 German police and prosecutors raided Volkswagen facilities and employees\u2019 homes at dawn. VW plans to recall 11 million cars and is bracing for class actions from consumers who paid a premium for what they were led to believe was a more efficient and environmentally friendly ride. To raise funds the company will need to pay all the costs associated with the scandal, several industry analysts foresee VW selling off one or more of its 12 brands, such as Bentley, the British racing-turned-luxury sedan manufacturer, which has struggled recently, or Ducati, the Italian motorcycle maker. Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, has resigned. Five managers have been suspended or have gone on leave, including Wolfgang Hatz, the former head of engines and transmissions development at VW. (A VW spokesman declined to comment on any personnel matters.) Winterkorn\u2019s replacement, Matthias M\u00fcller, has said a company investigation so far points to a small circle of employees as being involved in the scheme. Its U.S. chief, Michael Horn,   the same thing: \u201cThis was a couple of software engineers who put this in for whatever reasons,\u201d he said. When Horn testified before the House, Representative Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, told him he couldn\u2019t believe the fraud involved only a few renegades\u2014not at a rule-bound, Teutonic technocracy. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t written by one person in their basement in the dark of night,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to integrate that into the   of a multinational corporation, and nobody knows a darn thing about it?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re working full speed on a fast and unsparing clarification of the issue. As soon as we can make reliable statements on this we will do this without undue delay,\u201d wrote VW in a statement to  . \u201cAccording to current knowledge we continue to assume that only a few employees participated in the development of this software.\u201d Note that careful phrasing about participation \u201cin the development.\u201d It is possible very few engineers were involved in writing the code. But the diesel engine has been around for more than 100 years. It was invented in Germany. Is it really possible that a German company run by engineers believed the diesel engine had suddenly become clean? \u00a0 \u00a0 In the mid-2000s the auto industry faced its biggest transformation since the advent of seat belts. High oil prices put fuel economy at a premium, propelling the market for hybrid vehicles and putting a new gloss on diesel cars, which got better mileage than gasoline cars. Diesels famously generate smog, but spew a lot less greenhouse gas. That was another selling point, as fears of climate change helped drive increasingly stringent emissions rules, especially in the U.S. Federal and state regulators,  , began to lay down timelines for new requirements that would demand ingenious feats of engineering. The pressure sparked innovation. In Japan, Toyota made its half-electric Prius. In the U.S., Elon Musk got famous combining luxury and lithium ion batteries in his Tesla. But at Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg, a bit more than an hour by commuter train west of Berlin, executives were dismissive of newer technologies. \u201cThe big run on hybrids remains a limited phenomenon,\u201d then-CEO Winterkorn said in 2007. VW liked diesel. A   market in the U.S., diesels accounted for more than half the new-car registrations in the European Union that year. They were cheaper than hybrids and packed more muscle under the hood yet still often got more than 40 miles to the gallon. VW, which aspired to surpass Toyota as the largest carmaker in the world, saw the U.S. as a growth market for a new diesel engine, one that could be branded as green. The trick would be to engineer a way to strip sooty exhaust of its pollutants to meet the new U.S. rules. In 2005 the company had hired Wolfgang Bernhard to head the VW brand and solve the puzzle of a next-generation, four-cylinder diesel engine that would go in consumer cars like the Jetta. Bernhard broke with existing VW management with two decisions. First, for the construction of the engine itself, he rejected a pump injection model that Winterkorn and others had championed and chose instead a \u201ccommon rail\u201d injection system that sent precise bursts of fuel into the motor. Second, to clean up the exhaust and meet emissions standards, Bernhard adopted a competitor\u2019s technology. He chose a Daimler invention called BlueTec that sprayed urea into the exhaust stream to neutralize harmful nitrogen oxides, which can cause asthma and other ailments. To make it work, cars need to be fitted with an extra pump and a tank of what is essentially cat pee. Volkswagen went so far as announcing a deal with Daimler. Another German rival, BMW, also joined in. Then, in November 2006, Volkswagen\u2019s CEO was ousted in a boardroom battle. The new CEO, Winterkorn, got rid of Bernhard, too. Winterkorn had come up through the Audi business line, and in February 2007 he gave Hatz, the division\u2019s engine development head, the same job for the whole Volkswagen group. A cigar-smoking sports car obsessive, Hatz decorated his offices with race memorabilia, preferring to rhapsodize about the Porsche 911 than talk about business plans or sales. Hatz scrapped the BlueTec deal in a classic case of not-invented-here syndrome, according to an executive involved in the project. That decision, at the start of 2007, boxed Volkswagen engineers in as they tried to meet emissions targets and protect the driving experience and fuel efficiency. The new team wanted to avoid urea tanks, which were expensive and took up precious space in tiny cars. Instead, they created a system with traps in the tailpipe to catch some of the harmful substances. They also devised a method to scrub away nitrogen oxide by pumping extra fuel into the engine\u2019s cylinders and onward to the exhaust system, where it reacted with other pollutants to form harmless waste. They called it a Lean NOx Trap.  \u00a0 \u00a0 In 2008, VW brought its \u201cclean diesel\u201d to the U.S. with a publicity worthy of Barnum. It landed a Guinness World Record by providing a Jetta to a husband-and-wife team who drove the car through the contiguous 48 states and averaged 58.8 miles to the gallon\u2014unprecedented for any car on that route. At the Los Angeles Auto Show, VW entered its 2009 Jetta TDI Clean Diesel in a Green Car of the Year contest whose jurors included Jay Leno and the executive director of the Sierra Club. The Jetta won, beating out hybrids. At a conference the same year on diesel emissions, in Dearborn, Mich., a VW executive boasted that the new engines had all the environmental benefits of a hybrid car, without any drag on performance. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sacrifice power to be environmentally conscious,\u201d declared one of the slides. While the idea of power without pollution took off among U.S. consumers, engineers familiar with the technology knew that such claims required magical thinking. \u201cThat is the story of Santa Claus,\u201d says Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. Without the urea system, \u201cit\u2019s not possible to meet the standard.\u201d The Lean NOx Trap is a system of concessions. To get cleaner exhaust, you\u2019d need to use a squirt of fuel every few seconds to burn up nitrogen oxide. Or, in the other direction, to get better fuel efficiency, you\u2019d need to spew out dirtier exhaust. Managing this trade-off requires a complex calibration of the onboard computer, the engine control unit, so it can adjust constantly to variables like temperature and speed and optimize both emissions and fuel usage. The trouble was, Volkswagen hadn\u2019t been able to get its new engines to comply with the stringent U.S. standards. In 2007 the company had even delayed for six months the release of the new diesel Jetta that was to be at the forefront of the U.S. push. What could be done to make it pass the tests? Cheating was   option. Defeat devices for emissions testing are as old as the tests themselves. The early ones, in the 1970s, were primitive\u2014basically on\/off devices, says Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group. VW installed sensors on some 1973 models that turned off emissions controls outside a certain temperature range. In 1978, recognizing the increasing sophistication of emissions controls, the EPA issued a notice warning automakers not to use computer software or other new technology as defeat devices. That didn\u2019t put a stop to anything. In 1995, General Motors agreed to pay $45 million after being accused of installing a chip that turned off pollution controls on 470,000 Cadillacs when the air conditioning came on. Who exactly is responsible for devising and allowing the VW cheat remains a mystery. One of the clearest explanations so far has come from VW board member  , head of Germany\u2019s Lower Saxony state, which is VW\u2019s second-biggest shareholder. He explained in an Oct. 13 speech to his state parliament how the new diesel engines couldn\u2019t meet the U.S. requirements, and rather than addressing the issue, VW covered up with the software cheat. \u201cIn subsequent years there followed a use of this software in other models and other countries,\u201d said Weil. Perhaps the engineers told themselves that the cheat was a stopgap, and they\u2019d address it later. If so, they didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not credible that top managers were unaware corners had been cut, says Dudenh\u00f6ffer, who worked at Porsche and other carmakers before entering academia. In contrast to GM, where finance people have run the show for years, and Ford Motor, whose former CEO is a turnaround specialist from another industry, VW is a company where the engineers are in charge. It\u2019s always claimed that an engineer-filled executive suite was a precondition of building top-quality cars. Winterkorn ran around at auto shows with a tape measure and a magnet to examine vehicles from rival carmakers, while back in his own shop he got involved in technical details. When VW managers called for clean diesel without the urea system, \u201cthey must have known that it\u2019s impossible, or else it\u2019s not possible they have degrees as engineers,\u201d Dudenh\u00f6ffer says. VW\u2019s German headquarters certainly had a grip on pollution numbers. It oversaw the technical aspects of U.S. emissions, according to Horn\u2019s testimony to Congress, with the data passed to an office in Auburn Hills, Mich., for submission to U.S. regulators. If any vehicle failed to meet emissions targets, a team of engineers from Wolfsburg or luxury brand Audi\u2019s base in Ingolstadt was flown in, according to a person familiar with the operations. After the group had tinkered with the vehicle for about a week, the car would then pass the test, according to that person. The pressure on engineers only grew. As VW boasted about its clean-diesel revolution, the U.S. continued to toughen pollution standards. In 2011, EPA officials announced the second phase of an ambitious environmental plan under which carmakers would have to increase the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks from an average of 35.5 mpg to 54.5 mpg by 2025, while also reducing carbon dioxide emissions further. Companies could win special credits for electric cars, hybrid pickups, and other technology considered groundbreaking\u2014credits that would make the overall fleet standard easier to meet. VW and Mercedes-Benz were frustrated that they weren\u2019t also given credit for their diesel technology. Margo Oge, a native of Athens who\u2019d watched air pollution erode the Parthenon, started at the EPA in 1980 and was, in 2011, director of its Office of Transportation and Air Quality. In that role, she negotiated directly with automakers over the new rules. Oge found Hatz, then VW\u2019s chief of engine development, outspoken to the point of arrogance in his belief in diesel\u2019s superiority. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to invest in hybrids,\u201d Oge says. \u201cThey were 100 percent committed to diesel, and they wanted us to give them credit for bringing diesels into the market.\u201d At the agency, that view was dead on arrival. The EPA wanted the credits to encourage new technology, not reward older methods, no matter how worthy. When Oge said as much in a meeting at the EPA\u2019s Washington headquarters, Hatz flushed with anger. Hatz\u2019s VW colleagues later called Oge to apologize. \u00a0 \u00a0 In retrospect, it seems so obvious. In Park Slope, Brooklyn, Marcella Eckels noticed something was up in 2011 when she replaced her Mini Cooper with a diesel Jetta SportWagen to accommodate the arrival of twins. Eckels is an environmental lawyer, the kind of green consumer VW appealed to. She thought \u201cclean diesel\u201d sounded anachronistic; on the other hand, she wanted the fuel efficiency and liked the way the Jetta felt to drive. \u201cIt was winter, and there was all this black soot on the back of the car,\u201d Eckels says. \u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s weird, but it passed the emissions test, so whatever.\u2019\u2009\u201d All U.S. regulators had to do was look across the pond to Europe to see evidence that \u201cclean diesel\u201d did not  . A 2011 study sponsored by the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission\u2019s in-house scientific research body, found that on-road nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel cars were 90 percent higher than emissions limits. A second study by the JRC, published the next year, found nitrogen oxide emissions 130 percent higher. The authors of both studies called for new testing procedures to supplement the existing oversight, and noted the deterioration of air quality in many cities. The data from Europe had an unexpected result. Europeans weren\u2019t about to give up their cheap-running diesels for hybrids. But maybe they could make some adjustments based on the presumably cleaner versions pioneered for the U.S. market. Looking to rehabilitate diesel as a more climate-friendly option, ICCT decided to gather evidence in the U.S., where diesel cars met even stricter standards than in Europe. Surely the American models really were running cleaner. \u201cWe thought the vehicles would be clean,\u201d says John German, U.S. co-director of ICCT. \u201cWe had no cause for suspicion.\u201d That\u2019s when the organization made its proposal for road tests in West Virginia. With the West Virginia study as a launching pad, in May 2014 the California watchdog and the EPA opened an investigation into Volkswagen. Talks between the parties went on for months. The company said it had identified the reasons for the higher emissions and proposed a fix. That resulted in a recall of nearly 500,000 U.S. vehicles in December 2014 to implement a software patch. Most of those cars ran on the first-generation clean-diesel engines introduced in 2008. But the recall also included two subsequent versions that belatedly incorporated the urea system, starting with a Passat in 2012. In theory, the limited introduction of the cleaner urea technology could have solved the problem behind the cheat. Engineers could have quietly backed away from the ruse and hoped nobody would notice, at least for those models. But they didn\u2019t. Instead, they kept the defeat device; there\u2019s money and hassle to be saved by shutting off the urea system, because running dirty means not having to refill the pee tank as often. More clues piled up. At this year\u2019s Real World Emissions Workshop in Long Beach, Calif., a group of researchers, who\u2019d worked with Borken-Kleefeld, the Austrian scientist, presented data gathered from a far larger sample\u2014millions of cars on the road in Colorado. Emissions from Audis and Volkswagens stood out as much higher than they should have been. VW was paying attention to every turn of the screw. After the presentation, a regulatory specialist from Volkswagen\u2019s Auburn Hills office asked for a copy of the Colorado analysis. The regulators at CARB, meanwhile, continued to test VW cars to see if the recall had fixed the problem. It was concerned that real-world road tests couldn\u2019t confirm that the software patch was working. Sure enough, nitrogen oxide emissions were still in violation of California and U.S. laws. The agency shared those findings with Volkswagen and the EPA on July 8. At VW\u2019s Oxnard facility, the level of paranoia was rising in July and August, according to a person who worked there. In one instance, a manager accused a low-level employee of being an EPA plant. At WVU, all was quiet until the Friday morning in September when the scandal broke. An EPA official e-mailed to pass on the news and to say that the WVU lab would get the credit for leading regulators to Volkswagen\u2019s cheat. The fallout so far has been predictable, from the departure of CEO Winterkorn to executives making the rounds of legislative hearings from Rome to Washington to offer their apologies and assurances. If there\u2019s been any surprise, it\u2019s that VW disclosed the defeat device so readily. Or maybe not: For VW\u2019s vaunted engineer-executives, it\u2019s better to admit guilt than stupidity. And in a little-noticed announcement on Oct. 13, Volkswagen said that from now on, \u201cDiesel vehicles will only be equipped with exhaust emissions systems that use the best environmental technology.\u201d Which one? BlueTec, the system whose rejection started it all. \u00a0","timestamp":1445410816.0,"participant_ids":["VOW:GR","26929MF:US","BMW:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-21\/how-could-volkswagen-s-top-engineers-not-have-known-","subject":"How Could Volkswagen\u2019s Top Engineers Not Have Known?"},{"body":" Hewlett-Packard Co., the world\u2019s second-biggest computer maker, has narrowed the list of bidders for control of two Chinese units that could fetch more than $2.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said.

For Ceva Chief Executive Officer Gideon Wertheizer, that rebound, which comes after a 63 percent sell-off since 2011, serves as something of a vote of confidence in his plan to carve out a niche taking on Qualcomm Inc. in China. While Qualcomm is the world\u2019s largest mobile phone-chip maker, China\u2019s market is bigger than any other in the world, giving Wertheizer an opportunity to sell to companies focused on low-end phones that he expects will take a growing slice of the business. \u201cWe are in a trend to increase our market share, because we are expanding our share against incumbents like Qualcomm,\u201d Wertheizer said by phone from Herzliya, Israel. \u201cWe still have a lot to grow in the handset market, while they are mature.\u201d Wertheizer was the head of Ceva when it was the licensing unit of DSP Group in Israel and became CEO of the independent company, based in Mountain View, California, in 2005. Its rally since Oct. 7 compares with a 1.3 percent advance on the Bloomberg Israel-US Equity index. The Tel Aviv 25 Index added 0.7 percent to 1,495.54 at the close. Ceva, whose market value has been cut in half to $388 million from its 2011 peak, is rebuilding its share of the mobile-phone chip market after its fortunes collapsed alongside larger players like Finnish handset maker Nokia Oyj, and the exit of customers like Broadcom Corp. and ST-Ericsson. The company designs digital signal processors that power mobile phones, and licenses those designs to chip designers for an upfront fee. It also collects royalties on the sale of phones later built off its plans. Chinese chip designers like Spreadtrum Communications Inc. and MediaTek Inc. that use Ceva\u2019s technology are poised to take market share from Qualcomm, which was slapped with a $975 million fine this month by Chinese antitrust regulators, according to Barclays Plc and Wunderlich Securities Inc. Emily Kilpatrick, a spokeswoman for San Diego-based Qualcomm, declined to comment. \u201cChina is trying to develop an indigenous semiconductor capability and that\u2019s good for Ceva because they\u2019re licensing technology to a lot of those companies,\u201d Matt Robison, a San Francisco-based analyst with Wunderlich, said by phone Feb. 20. Ceva\u2019s revenue rose 4 percent to $50.8 million last year, the first increase since 2011, and net income is forecast to rise 8 percent in 2015. Five out of eight analysts recommend buying the shares, with an average return forecast of 20 percent over the next 12 months. Wertheizer is also feeling optimistic because he\u2019s diversifying beyond the mobile phone market. Ceva\u2019s wireless communications technology is now being designed into chips for automated driver assistance systems, hearing aids and game consoles. Thirty-two of 36 license agreements last year were for applications outside of mobile phones, the company said on a Feb. 3 earnings call. \u201cThe second part of the growth story is even more interesting\u201d than handsets, said Joseph Wolf, an analyst with Barclays Plc in New York who has a buy rating on Ceva. \u201cIt\u2019s always good for companies to have multiple streams of revenue.\u201d Still, revenue from these new applications won\u2019t materialize until 2016 at the earliest, Wolf said. A big jump in handset revenue is still a few quarters away for Ceva because much of the low-cost market in China is based on 3G phones, which are cheaper and yield lower royalties for Ceva, said Jay Srivatsa, an analyst with Chardan Capital Markets LLC in New York. \u201cWhat used to be a 5 or 6-cent business has become a 3-cent business,\u201d Srivatsa said by phone Feb. 19. \u201cThe next quarter or two could be pretty rough for the company.\u201d Qualcomm dominates high-end mobile phone chips, and it\u2019s unclear when 4G handset prices will drop enough to lure Ceva\u2019s target customers in China and across emerging markets to upgrade to smartphones, he said. Wertheizer says that demand for cheaper smartphones in places like China, India, Indonesia and African countries will allow him to compete against Qualcomm, which had about 500 times more revenue than Ceva last year. \u201cThey\u2019re very good technology, no doubt of that, but when it comes to the high volume market, they\u2019re facing competition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe growth is in emerging markets.\u201d","timestamp":1424548801.0,"participant_ids":["CEVA:US","QCOM:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-21\/taking-on-qualcomm-in-china-gives-ceva-a-boost","subject":"Taking on Qualcomm in China Gives Ceva a Boost"},{"body":" The man spearheading China\u2019s government-sponsored drive to buy foreign chip technology has revealed himself as a billionaire in the process. Zhao Weiguo tapped connections at his alma mater Tsinghua University, whose alumni include China\u2019s two most recent presidents, to make acquisitions and amass a $2 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd., a unit of the university\u2019s holding company that Zhao\u2019s chairman of, signed a $1.45 billion deal with Intel Corp. last year and was shortlisted to buy more than $2.5 billion of Hewlett-Packard Co. assets, people familiar with the matter have  . China, with 1.3 billion mobile-phone accounts, is   to build its domestic chip industry and reduce reliance on overseas producers. Chinese companies led by Unigroup have tapped that state support for most of the $6.1 billion in major chip-related takeovers they\u2019ve made during the past two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cThe electronics industry is getting a lot of policy and state capital support because it\u2019s seen as a key industry to build out,\u201d Fan Guohe, an analyst with Phillip Securities Ltd. in Shanghai, said by phone. \u201cThere is a huge gap to fill.\u201d Unigroup   last month it received 10 billion yuan in funding commitments over five years from policy lender China Development Bank Corp. and a government-backed fund to invest in semiconductors. It\u2019s among bidders shortlisted for 51 percent stakes in Hewlett-Packard\u2019s Hangzhou-based networking-gear unit H3C Technologies Co. and its Chinese server business, the people said last week. If Unigroup is successful, the deal would be its third major acquisition in the past two years. The Beijing-based company bought U.S.-listed Spreadtrum Communications Inc. for $1.5 billion in 2013 and RDA Microelectronics Inc. last year for $893 million, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In September, Intel agreed to spend as much as 9 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) on a stake in a Unigroup subsidiary holding stakes in the two chip designers. The transaction values the unit, which is wholly-owned by Unigroup, at about $7.3 billion. The share prices of 35 listed Chinese semiconductor companies gained an average 31 percent this year, compared with a 14 percent rise in the nation\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Three calls and an e-mail sent to Unigroup\u2019s investors relations department went unanswered. , the 104-year-old alma mater of Chinese President Xi Jinping and his predecessor Hu Jintao, founded what later became Unigroup in 1988, according to the company\u2019s  . In a 2010 privatization, Beijing Jiankun Group, controlled by Zhao, became Unigroup\u2019s second-biggest shareholder after the university. Zhao controls 70 percent of Beijing Jiankun, which will own about 39 percent of the Unigroup subsidiary holding the two chip designers after Intel\u2019s investment, according to company filings obtained by Bloomberg News. That gives Zhao a 27 percent interest in the Unigroup unit valued at about $2 billion. Li Yi and Li Luyuan, the other two shareholders of Beijing Jiankun with a 15 percent stake each, are both worth about $424 million. Zhao has bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, according to a biography posted on the   of Tsinghua Entrepreneur & Executive Club, an alumni organization.

The aircraft deal will be split between new Boeing Co. 737-900ER single-aisle planes and smaller, secondhand Embraer SA E-190s, Delta said Wednesday. The Boeing craft have a list value of about $2 billion before the discounts that are customary in the industry. Acquiring E-190s will support Delta\u2019s strategy of bringing higher-capacity planes while retiring its smallest regional models.

The board\u2019s decision opens the door for the two groups to start talking to each other,\u00a0the U.S. semiconductor company said in a statement Tuesday. Fairchild\u2019s shares jumped 3.5 percent to $21.19 at the close in New York. They are up 29 percent over the past 12 months. Fairchild, which agreed to a merger in November with ON Semiconductor Corp. for $20 a share, said last week it received a  , unsolicited acquisition offer of $21.70 a share in cash from a bidder identified as \u201cParty G\u201d -- the same group as the one led by China Resources\u2019 semiconductor arm, a person familiar with the matter   at the time. The revised offer would value the company\u2019s equity at $2.46 billion, compared with the $2.4 billion value of the bid from ON Semiconductor. If the China Resources-led group and Fairchild reach an agreement, ON Semiconductor could choose to push the bidding higher, according to Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR & Co.\u00a0 \u201cWe believe there is a meaningful probability that ON Semiconductor will raise its bid to $22 and perhaps higher,\u201d Rolland wrote in a note to clients on Dec. 30. On Dec. 14 Fairchild   an earlier China Resources bid as not necessarily a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d to the merger agreement with Phoenix-based ON Semiconductor. In the revised proposal, Party G offers to pay the $72 million that Fairchild would owe ON Semiconductor as a breakup fee if it canceled the merger agreement, according to the filing. Additionally, the group provided a debt commitment letter from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said he doesn\u2019t think it would be good for ON to enter into a bidding war with the Chinese consortium, because ON has limited resources. \u201cThey just spent 15 years working out of debt and they would have to increase their debt again,\u201d said Cassidy, who has a hold recommendation on Fairchild and a buy rating for ON. Another reason for ON to stay out of the bidding war is that the two companies still have too many products that overlap, he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get the benefit of owning,\u201d he said. The battle for Fairchild is the latest example of escalating bids and drawn out fights for semiconductor companies. The industry saw about $110 billion in deals last year as companies combined in the face of rising costs of production and a shrinking customer list. Microsemi Corp. was in a monthlong contest with Skyworks Solutions Inc. for PMC-Sierra Inc., which Microsemi ultimately won in November for about $2.5 billion. China has been trying to create a national champion in semiconductors. The country buys more than half the semiconductors sold each year, and its share is growing. Yet the nation doesn\u2019t have one domestic manufacturer among the 10 biggest chipmakers, a list stacked with U.S. companies. State-owned China Resources controls the brewer of Snow, the world\u2019s most popular beer brand, as well as the Vanguard grocery chain, power plants and cement production.

Southeast Asia\u2019s largest carrier, which owns 55.8 percent of Tiger Airways, said Friday it plans to pay S$0.41 in cash for each share.\u00a0While that\u2019s 32 percent higher than Thursday\u2019s close, it\u2019s not even one-third of the\u00a0S$1.50 share price in Tiger Airways\u2019s initial public offering in  . Singapore Airlines is seeking to delist Tiger Airways after it made losses\u00a0in five of the past six quarters because of over expansion in a competitive market that has caused other airlines to privatize or collapse. Malaysia Airlines was taken private last year after two plane crashes, and there have been reports -- denied by management -- that AirAsia Bhd., Malaysia\u2019s biggest budget carrier, also\u00a0could be privatized. \u201cTiger Air has been restructuring operations by cancelling loss-making routes. By doing so, earnings are at an inflection point,\u201d Alan Richardson, a Hong Kong-based money manager at Samsung Asset Management Ltd., said in an e-mail. \u201cThis is a tactically well-timed move for Singapore Air.\u201d Shares of Singapore Air fell 0.1 percent to close at S$11.14 in the city state. Tiger Airways jumped by a record 32 percent to close at S$0.41, the price Singapore Airlines is offering to pay shareholders.\u00a0 Tiger Airways shareholders will have the option of buying Singapore Air shares at S$11.1043 each, a 0.4 percent discount to Thursday\u2019s close. The flag carrier said it has no plans to lay off workers. Singapore Air injected funds into Tiger Airways last year by increasing its stake to include the budget carrier as a subsidiary, along with SilkAir and Scoot Pte. Tiger Airways has reduced capacity, cut routes and ended partnerships in Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines to improve its financials. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraging Scoot and Tiger to cooperate and to commercially integrate as much as possible,\u201d\u00a0Singapore Air Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong said at a briefing Friday.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that progress. We think now is the time to take the integration and the synergies to the next level and what we\u2019re doing now is necessary.\u201d Tiger Airways\u2019s restructuring is symptomatic of the challenges\u00a0low-cost airlines face in South and Southeast Asia, where many budget carriers are unable to take advantage of increasing traffic because of low fares and high capital expenditures on new planes.\u00a0 Tiger Airways reported a loss of S$12.8 million in the three months ended September, down from S$182.4 million a year earlier, and filled 84.1 percent of its seats. Passenger yields,\u00a0or the money earned from carrying travelers one kilometer, rose 8.2 percent to 6.6 cents. \u201cOur investment in Tiger provides the SIA Group an additional engine of growth in an expanding segment of the air travel market,\" Goh said in an e-mail to employees. \u201cThis ultimately strengthens the SIA Group as it enables us to tap into market segments that would not otherwise be available to us.\u201d Asked about the price differential from Tiger Airways\u2019s IPO level of S$1.50, Goh said Friday\u2019s offer price was \"very compelling.\u201d He noted that it\u2019s higher than Tiger Airways\u2019s recent stock performance and analyst targets. \u201cThis is about generating growth,\u201d Goh said. \u201cFor shareholders, if you wish to participate in this exciting industry and all is about growth -- not just for Tiger but for the whole group -- there\u2019s an option for shareholders to continue to participate in that growth with a subscription to SIA shares.\u201d The offer comes a day after Singapore Air reported group net income\u00a0more than doubled to S$213.6 million in the quarter ended September, after adding Tiger\u2019s earnings into its own account. The group\u2019s operating profit dropped 2.3 percent to S$129 million, with the flagship carrier\u2019s profit falling 29 percent to S$98 million. The company said savings from lower fuel prices were partially offset by hedging losses. The airline has hedged 50.7 percent of its fuel needs for the second half of the fiscal year to March 2016 at an average price of $93 per barrel. Singapore Air expects losses from fuel-hedging to decline, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Barnes said at a briefing Friday. The airline plans to restart nonstop flights to New York and Los Angeles from Singapore in 2018 and expects to add a third U.S. destination with new Airbus Group SE A350 aircraft, Goh said. Singapore Air has ordered seven A350 ultra-long range planes and could consider adding more, he said. Singapore Air also offers flights to 46 Asian destinations through its   subsidiary. It has been enhancing cooperation between Tiger Airways and Scoot, including by offering seats on each others\u2019 planes. The two budget carriers will continue to be run separately for now, Goh said. \u201cIt makes complete sense for Tiger Air to be a 100 percent owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines,\u201d said Timothy Ross, a Singapore-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. \u201cI can see a number of unexhausted areas of synergies.\u201d","timestamp":1446761015.0,"participant_ids":["TGR:SP","SIA:SP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-06\/singapore-air-offers-to-buy-tiger-air-shares-at-41-cents-a-share","subject":"Singapore Air Offers $322 Million to Take Tiger Air Private"},{"body":"Switzerland instructed UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG to hold capital equal to 5 percent of assets, raising the bar on a rule designed to protect taxpayers from having to bail out banks. The decision came just hours after Credit Suisse announced a capital increase of 6.05 billion Swiss francs ($6.3 billion) as part of an overhaul that will help the bank comply with the new rule, known as the leverage ratio. Both banks had pressed the government in recent months for easier terms. At least 3.5 percent of the capital must be of the highest quality, or common equity Tier 1. The remaining 1.5 percent must be in Tier 1 instruments that would be converted or written down if the CET1 ratio falls below 7 percent, according to a separate statement from Finma, the Swiss financial regulator. Bonds that fulfill this requirement are known as high-trigger or \u201cgoing-concern capital.\u201d On top of this, the banks must hold 5 percent of loss-absorbing debt, measured in terms of total exposure. The implementation of the high-trigger standard may exclude 5.1 billion francs of Credit Suisse\u2019s 11.5 billion francs of outstanding Tier 1 notes, based on its latest earnings presentation. Just over half of UBS\u2019s about 5 billion francs of AT1s have a 7 percent trigger, based on Bloomberg data. \"For existing capital instruments which can no longer be issued as eligible under the new requirements, transitional provisions are envisaged in the sense of grandfathering,\" the government said in a separate statement. The banks have until the end of 2019 to satisfy the requirement, the government said in a statement Wednesday. Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan said he doesn\u2019t expect the new rule to hurt the economy. It will instead improve \u201cthe stability of the Swiss financial system and the economy as a whole,\u201d said Mark Branson, head of the financial regulator Finma. The leverage ratio gained importance for regulators in the United States and Europe after several banks, including Zurich-based UBS, were bailed out in the financial crisis. It is a measure of the losses a bank can sustain before its shareholders are wiped out. A government-appointed panel recommended in December that Switzerland follow the lead of the U.S., which has also raised its leverage ratio to 5 percent. UBS and Credit Suisse have assets of 1.83 trillion francs combined, about three times Switzerland\u2019s gross domestic product. That means the two banks present a bigger risk to their local economy than their peers elsewhere.","timestamp":1445431815.0,"participant_ids":["CSGN:VX","UBSG:VX"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-21\/switzerland-sets-leverage-ratio-at-5-for-ubs-credit-suisse","subject":"Switzerland Sets Leverage Ratio at 5% for UBS, Credit Suisse"},{"body":" BlackBerry Ltd.\u2019s patent portfolio holds two key allures for any acquirer: security and basic wireless technologies. Those are among the prime pieces of intellectual property held by the Waterloo, Ontario-based mobile-technology company. Reuters today said BlackBerry and Samsung Electronics Co. held deal discussions spurred by a desire to obtain the Canadian company\u2019s patents, a report that   companies later denied. Still, the report puts BlackBerry\u2019s patents in the spotlight. The company has a combination of older patents on the basic functioning of a mobile phone, as well as newer ones on security and on consumer-friendly features such as predictive typing on a keyboard or setting up meeting schedules. That\u2019s a treasure trove for any potential buyer because security is becoming more important to companies that are trying to avoid the type of hacking that struck Sony Corp. last year, in which numerous e-mails and personal information of employees were disclosed. Many of BlackBerry\u2019s patents underlie the fast-growing mobile industry, where lawsuits over basic technologies have been abundant. BlackBerry has about 44,000 patents worldwide, said Desmond Lau, an analyst at Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp., with any buyer likely to be most interested in the ones related to security technologies. \u201cPeople talk about it having great stuff in it,\u201d said Ron Epstein, chief executive officer of patent brokerage Epicenter IP Group LLC in Redwood City, California. \u201cWhen I\u2019m looking at the technology and saying do I want that in my product, I can buy yours or I can develop my own.\u201d For Samsung, security patents would help it expand into lucrative government contracts and corporate customers. Mobile-technology patents more generally also could help winnow down any money Samsung might have to pay Apple Inc. in the long-running smartphone wars. The companies have dropped all litigation outside the U.S., with two U.S. appeals court cases pending that would help determine the value of patents on unique features of complex devices. Some of the BlackBerry patented features and operating system, if licensed to Apple, could lower any licensing costs for Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung. BlackBerry typically ranks in the top 75 annual patent recipients, obtaining 500 to 1,000 patents every year on improvements to its mobile devices, according to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office figures. Among the patents it received just this month are ones that cover secure message handling, a new type of keyboard, smartphones that can measure magnetic fields and e-mail filters. Other recent patents include ones for a display that\u2019s less likely to shatter when dropped, allowing the collaborative editing of media on different devices, and ways to control household appliances through a smartphone. The company has also built up the portfolio through at least one acquisition. In 2011, the company was one of six that agreed to pay a combined $4.5 billion to buy more than 6,000 patents from Nortel Networks Corp. Apple and BlackBerry cite each other\u2019s technology in patent applications more than any other two North American device makers, MDB Capital Group LLC, a Santa Monica, California-based patent-investment bank, said in a 2013 study. Companies are required to identify competing technology to ensure they aren\u2019t claiming something already patented. BlackBerry\u2019s patent portfolio has been challenged by other companies that claimed to have invented some of the key technologies behind mobile e-mail. In 2006, BlackBerry, then operating as Research in Motion Inc., settled with patent holding company NTP Inc. for $612.5 million to end a case that threatened its ability to provide its e-mail services. Purchasing a company for its patents is a well-worn tactic in the technology industry, of course. Google Inc. bought Motorola\u2019s mobile-devices business in 2012 for $9.8 billion to secure patents that would protect the Web company and its partners, as Google competed with Apple and BlackBerry with its Android mobile software for smartphones.","timestamp":1421267739.0,"participant_ids":["BB:CN","005930:KS"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-14\/blackberrys-patent-portfolio-is-wireless-trove-for-acquirer","subject":"BlackBerry\u2019s Patent Portfolio Is Wireless Trove for Acquirer"},{"body":"     (Bloomberg) -- RPX Corp., a San Francisco patent risk-management company, gave details in a regulatory filing of its purchase of a portfolio of 4,000 patent assets from Rockstar Consortium LLC, a group of companies set up to buy intellectual property from defunct Canadian phonemaker Nortel Networks Corp.  The assets were part of a group of more than 6,000 patents that Plano, Texas-based Rockstar acquired from Nortel in 2011. Rockstar was set up by Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Ericsson AB and Sony Corp.  Rockstar was paid $900 million in cash, with $35 million coming directly from RPX itself and the remainder from a group of more than 30 companies, according to the filing. In return for their contribution, members of the buyer group will receive non-exclusive licenses to the patents.  RPX will make the patents available to other interested companies under what it called fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Additionally, eight infringement cases against 16 companies -- including Google Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- are to be dismissed, RPX said.  Comarco Wireless Technologies Inc., a maker of power adapters for portable electronic devices, sued Apple Inc. for patent infringement.  According to a complaint filed in federal court in Santa Ana, California, Apple is accused of infringing patent 8,492,933. The patent, which covers a power adapter that plugs into either an alternating current or a direct current source, was issued to Lake Forest, California-based Comarco in July 2013.  Comarco claims the patent is infringed by Apple power adapters and the Apple Lightning cable connector that are used with the Cupertino, California-based technology company\u2019s products such as the iPad.  In addition to money damages, Comarco asked for an order barring further infringement and for attorney fees and litigation costs. Alleging the infringement is deliberate, Comarco requested additional damages to punish Apple for its actions.  Apple didn\u2019t respond immediately to requests for comment on the litigation.  The case is Comarco Wireless Technologies Inc. v. Apple Inc., 8:15-cv-00145, U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana).  For more patent news, click here.  Guess Inc., the Los Angeles fashion house, won a French trademark battle with luxury goods-maker Gucci, the Los Angeles Business Journal reported.  Gucci, a unit of Paris-based Kering SA, had accused Guess of infringing its trademarks and competing unfairly, according to the newspaper.  Instead of awarding Gucci requested damages of 55 million euros ($63 million), the Court of Paris ordered the company to pay Guess 30,000 Euros and invalidated a Gucci trademark, the business journal reported.  Gucci made similar infringement claims against Guess in the U.S. and Italy, according to the publication.

Valeant, briefly the largest stock in Canada\u2019s benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s\/TSX Composite Index this year, plummeted as much as 39 percent Wednesday after a stock-commentary site run by a short seller accused it of an Enron-like sales accounting strategy. The setback was the latest for the Laval, Quebec-based company, which has seen more than half its market value evaporate after reaching a record in August amid intense scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers over its pricing practices. \u201cWhen a company shoots for the moon, you have to ask that question: Is it value, or is it just momentum?\u201d said Som Seif, chief executive officer of Purpose Investments Inc. in Toronto. His firm manages about C$1.4 billion ($1.1 billion). Risks associated with companies rapidly acquiring global recognition is \u201cone of the biggest concerns we have\u201d in an undiversified stock market. Valeant\u2019s slide comes in the wake of BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion, and Nortel, which both ascended to the global stage while dominating the Canadian market, only to crumble rapidly when problems exposed them to harsh investor scrutiny. BlackBerry has not recovered since losing its dominance in the smartphone market while Nortel filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009. \u201cDo we have a business here that\u2019s ultimately run effectively, can it hunker down, survive and build a great business?\u201d Seif said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. Obviously that didn\u2019t work out for RIM and for Nortel.\u201d Autorite des Marches Financiers, the Quebec securities regulator, said in an e-mailed statement Thursday the\u00a0allegations about Valeant are \u201cworrisome\u201d and is checking to see if Valeant didn\u2019t run afoul of regulations. Valeant shares extended losses a fourth day in Toronto, falling 12 percent to C$135.24 at 9:57 a.m. in Toronto. Valeant in a   called the short seller\u2019s report that it used a strategy of recording fake sales to phony customers \u201cerroneous\u201d and defended its relationship with specialty pharmacies that distribute its drugs.\u00a0Bill Ackman, chief executive of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and one of Valeant\u2019s largest investors, said he bought 2 million shares of Valeant. Those developments helped pare the stock\u2019s decline to 19 percent at the end of the day Wednesday. Valeant has been one of the most influential stocks in the S&P\/TSX in the past five years as Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson pursued an aggressive growth-by-acquisition strategy,   to make the drugmaker one of the top five largest in the world by 2016. In May, as Valeant marched toward an all-time high, the stock\u2019s 12-month advance to that point accounted for 60 percent of the overall index\u2019s  . The company climbed past Bank of Nova Scotia in February after surpassing others including Canadian National Railway Co., Enbridge Inc. and Bank of Montreal over the past 12 months. Valeant, along with BlackBerry and Nortel, are products of a Canadian equity market too concentrated in individual names and industries, said Shailesh Kshatriya, director of Canadian strategies at Russell Investments in Toronto. Canadian investors tend to have a pronounced home bias toward domestic stocks, making them especially vulnerable when an individual stock rapidly shoots to the top of the index. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue we\u2019re all aware of as Canadians but we all kind of put aside,\u201d Kshatriya said in a phone interview. Russell manages about C$344 billion. \u201cEspecially in a market like this, we tend to lose sight of that.\u00a0You feel most comfortable in your own environment and it turns into country bias.\u201d A good yardstick is to contrast the rapid growth of companies such as Valeant with more stable institutions such as Royal Bank of Canada, the largest lender in the nation, said Brandon Snow, a fund manager at Cambridge Global Asset Management, a unit of CI Investments Inc. \u201cIf a company in Canada gets larger than Royal Bank you have to watch out,\u201d Snow said in a phone interview. His firm manages about C$15 billion. \u201cThis again shows an inefficiency in the Canadian market due to lack of depth and diversity. Time and time again, segments of the market get overly excited and frothy, and large losses ensue.\u201d Valeant briefly   Royal Bank as its market value climbed to C$112.6 billion on July 23, ahead of Royal\u2019s C$109 billion market capitalization at the time. Valeant\u2019s market cap is now C$52.6 billion, while Royal Bank remains the largest company. Smartphone maker BlackBerry, along with fertilizer producer Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., combined for about 10 percent of the total market capitalization of the S&P\/TSX at their peak in June 2008. BlackBerry has since plunged 94 percent from its peak as competitors Apple Inc. and Google Inc. overtook the struggling smartphone maker. Yet these companies trail the impact of Nortel, which   had a market value of C$366 billion and accounted for as much as 35 percent of the index by weight in August 2000, according to data from TMX Group Ltd. Nortel, the telecommunications-equipment maker founded in 1895, had annual revenue of $28 billion at its peak in 2000, with 93,000 employees in more than 150 countries. It filed for   protection in 2009 after incorrectly booked revenue, inflating sales and restating earnings back to 1999. \u201cIt\u2019s short-term memory,\u201d Russell\u2019s Kshatriya said of Canadian investors getting caught up in stocks such as Valeant and Nortel. \u201cThree is a trend.

Saudi Aerospace Engineering Industries, which counts\u00a0Qatar Airways among more than 25 airline clients, is in talks to add carriers including local discounters Saudi Gulf Air and Al Maha Airways, according to Director General Nasser Al-Jasser, who said outside work could reach 40 percent of the total. SAEI plans to lift the value of its contracts to 8 billion riyals ($2.13 billion) from 5.3 billion riyals after opening a new 1 million square-meter facility at Jeddah airport by the end of next year, Al-Jasser said in an interview at the Dubai Air Show. Aircraft, engine and component overhaul will all be on offer. \u201cDomestic airlines that are coming up, we are definitely targeting those,\u201d Al-Jasser said. \u201cWhat we will focus on is maintaining airline spare parts, which is huge, more than maintaining airframes. I think the market is under-served.\u201d SAEI already has support contracts with Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. and wants to secure deals with General Electric Co. and Airbus Group SE in the next year or so, according to Al-Jasser, who said sales are likely to grow by about 5 percent a year. The backlog with its parent airline, known as Saudia, stretches to about seven months. The venture with Lufthansa Technik, the world\u2019s biggest aircraft-maintenance company, will see the German business supply components for Saudia\u2019s fleet of Airbus A320 and A330 jets while helping SAEI to develop overhaul capabilities on Airbus and Boeing models. It will also use SAEI as a subcontractor for those parts the Saudi company already holds.

They re-emerge at the water\u2019s edge, pile into a boat and are paddled back to Mexico as two Border Patrol agents approach on foot. The scene unfolds on a night-vision video showing white silhouettes walking and running against a gray background, all of it taken from a surplus military blimp once used to safeguard U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan from Taliban attacks. Moored on the U.S. side of the international boundary, the balloon is an unmanned, high-altitude sentinel carrying cameras that let   peer deep into Mexico and spot a human from 12 miles (20 kilometers) away in the dark. Five of the craft from makers including Lockheed Martin Corp. are doing so well in tests that the agency wants more of them. \u201cThis is putting long-range eyeballs at 500 to 5,000 feet that did not exist before,\u201d said Tobin Ruff, who runs the U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s program for tactical aerostats, as the blimps are formally known. The Obama administration budget plan unveiled Feb. 2 calls for spending an additional $8.5 million to add another aerostat to the quintet now airborne in Texas, said an aide for the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. The program now has $24 million in annual funding. With the U.S. pullout from Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 70 Defense Department aerostats are available for use on the U.S.-Mexico frontier, Customs and Border Protection says. Four of the current balloons are tethered across from Mexico\u2019s Tamaulipas state, the turf of the gang known as the Zetas. \u201cRight now, this region is the No. 1 threat from a Border Patrol perspective,\u201d Ruff said by phone from Arlington, Virginia. The aerostats have been a boon for Customs and Border Protection because the Pentagon made the investment in meshing sophisticated sensors with the old concept of battlefield observation balloons. Stationary aerial monitoring fills a niche between costly, free-flying drones and binocular-toting agents in pickup trucks, especially in rugged, vegetation-covered terrain like that along the tree-lined Rio Grande. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time with regards to the use of technology,\u201d said , an Eastern Kentucky University professor who has worked as a Department of Homeland Security contractor. \u201cWhen you combine the boots on the ground with this type of technology, it becomes a force multiplier.\u201d On the Border Patrol\u2019s aerostat footage taken at night near McAllen, Texas, agents are seen after dismounting their motorcycles. Scattering ahead of them are \u201cpersonnel,\u201d as the agency described them, as a \u201csmuggler\u201d splashes fiercely across the water from Mexico, retrieves the group and then retreats. Agents have seized 39 tons (35.4 metric tons) of narcotics since the aerostat deployments began over the past year, and caught or deterred about 90 percent of illegal border crossers, said Ruff, who didn\u2019t have details on existing security programs. Carlos Lazo, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, declined to comment on funding details for the aerostats. Three companies have blimps in the border trials: Lockheed, the largest U.S. contractor, No. 4 Raytheon Co. and closely held  . Lockheed\u2019s is the biggest -- 117 feet (36 meters) long and able to hover at 5,000 feet. Deployed near Roma, Texas, it\u2019s white and resembles a cross between the Pillsbury Dough Boy from TV commercials and a killer whale with three bulbous tail fins. As many as 65 Lockheed blimps flew in Afghanistan and Iraq, anchored near U.S. outposts for eye-in-the-sky surveillance. Soldiers brought back stories of Afghan mothers letting children play in sight of the \u201cbig balloon\u201d because it meant they would be safe, said Ronald Browning, director of business development for the Lockheed unit that includes aerostats. \u201cBeing with the troops in forward operating bases was a very good fit, and now looking at large reaches of the border is a very good fit,\u201d Browning said in an interview in Washington. Today\u2019s blimps far outstrip the capabilities of their earliest U.S. military predecessors, the Civil War balloons that relied on the buoyancy of flammable natural gas or hydrogen to hoist observers on reconnaissance missions for a few hours. Lockheed\u2019s aerostat can stay up for 30 days, lifted by inert helium. It\u2019s anchored by special fiber-optic and copper cables that send power and receive data from L-3 Communications Holding Inc.\u2019s Wescam MX-20  . Layered composite-fiber material gives the balloons strength and filters out damaging ultraviolet radiation. Raytheon\u2019s system \u201cis proven technology with a distinguished service record,\u201d according to a fact sheet from the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company, which declined requests for an interview. Fairfax, Virginia-based Technology & Supply Management also declined to comment. Monthly expenses for each balloon being tested are about $300,000 to $350,000, according to Ruff, the Customs and Border Protection official. Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed estimates that operating an aerostat costs a one-tenth as much as a drone. The agency\u2019s goal of surveillance blimps lining the border has support in Congress. Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who leads the House Committee on Homeland Security, has urged expanding aerostats in California, Arizona and his home state. \u201cAdditional surveillance equipment used successfully overseas, such as aerostats, has proven valuable in places such as the Rio Grande Valley to help gain and maintain operational control of the border,\u201d McCaul said in an October report. The Pentagon declined to comment on the surplus balloons. If they\u2019re not put on the border, they will be mothballed, and Customs and Border Protection will take all the aerostats that Congress will budget for, according to Ruff. \u201cIn terms of just pure technology,\u201d Ruff said, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of the Southwest border where these systems could be effective.\u201d","timestamp":1423537260.0,"participant_ids":["0356108Z:US","0217762Z:US","LMT:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-10\/blimps-from-taliban-watch-now-block-u-s-mexico-border-smugglers","subject":"The Latest Border Control: Iraq War Blimps"},{"body":" Puerto Rico\u2019s descent into junk has made its bonds more attractive to Goldman Sachs Asset Management and OppenheimerFunds Inc. even as their rivals flee. Goldman Sachs increased its stake in Puerto Rico bonds to $1.3 billion as of May 5 from $351 million in February 2014, when the island was cut to speculative grade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. OppenheimerFunds has snapped up sales-tax backed debt since the downgrade. The two are bucking the trend among the 10 largest mutual-fund holders of Puerto Rico bonds by increasing their stakes as yields on some securities have climbed to 10 percent. That\u2019s the equivalent of almost 18 percent for top earners when factoring in the tax exemption. Those payouts are alluring with municipal-bond yields holding near a five-decade low. \u201cThere\u2019s a point where there\u2019s going to be value -- these securities aren\u2019t worthless,\u201d said Gabe Diederich, a research analyst at Wells Capital Management, which ranks seventh among mutual-fund owners of Puerto Rico bonds. It holds mostly insured debt. \u201cWe have been hearing more and more that traditional buyers have been looking at buying Puerto Rico again.\u201d The split among the mutual funds highlights how Puerto Rico debt has increasingly become too speculative for many municipal-bond buyers, who seek tax-free income, not the outsized returns chased by hedge funds. OppenheimerFunds\u2019s increased stake keeps it the biggest mutual-fund owner of Puerto Rico bonds. The push from Goldman Sachs elevated the company\u2019s rank to third from eighth since February 2014. Franklin Resources Inc.\u2019s holdings have declined by more than $1 billion since then, though it\u2019s still the second-biggest owner. The jump in Goldman\u2019s investment began with the commonwealth\u2019s record junk deal in March 2014 and kept going as it more than tripled its ownership of the securities. The buying was led by its Strategic Income Fund, which invests in global bonds and uses derivatives to bet that asset prices will fall. New York-based OppenheimerFunds has made Puerto Rico a   for years because it\u2019s tax-free nationwide. The company\u2019s position in sales-tax bonds, known as Cofinas, increased to $325 million by the end of 2014, up from $40.6 million earlier in the year, Bloomberg data show. The securities, which don\u2019t mature until 2057 and aren\u2019t insured, trade at about 65 cents on the dollar. Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment on the holdings, as did Ray Pellecchia, a spokesman for OppenheimerFunds. Stacey Johnston Coleman, a spokeswoman for San Mateo, California-based Franklin, also declined to comment. Puerto Rico and its public agencies are struggling with $72 billion of debt and a sluggish economy. Bond prices have been trading at distressed levels for more than a year on speculation the island won\u2019t be able to pay all investors. Last week, its House of Representatives passed a tax plan that may help the commonwealth balance the fiscal 2016 budget. That   Puerto Rico\u2019s newest general-obligation bonds to a two-month high. The Senate   an amended version Monday, sending it back to the House. OppenheimerFunds created a   part of its website and said its shareholders \u201cmay want to bookmark\u201d it. The most-recent commentary on May 20 said elected officials usually \u201cknow better than to contemplate compromises related to their full and timely payments on general obligation debt.\u201d MacKay Shields and Capital Group Cos., the fourth- and eighth-biggest holders, respectively, have expanded their ownership by largely buying insured debt. They weren\u2019t in the top 10 when the island lost its investment-grade rank. Nuveen Asset Management, which oversees more than $100 billion in munis, has been paring its position: It was the third-largest holder of Puerto Rico bonds in February 2014. It now ranks sixth. \u201cThe lack of a roadmap for how you get to recovery, and what that recovery might be, is one of the hardest things to figure out right now,\u201d said John Miller, co-head of fixed income in Chicago at Nuveen. \u201cWe\u2019d want to have a better sense of that before committing capital.\u201d Eaton Vance Management, at ninth, has about 95 percent of holdings backed by insurers, said Craig Brandon, who helps oversee the company\u2019s $28.6 billion in munis. \u201cThere came a point where we were uncomfortable with each credit on an individual basis,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cWithout Chapter 9, you\u2019re playing the game with no referee -- anything can happen out there.\u201d Unlike U.S. local governments, Puerto Rico\u2019s indebted authorities, including its public-power company, can\u2019t file for bankruptcy to have their debt restructured in court. Allison Scott, a spokeswoman for MacKay, said most of the company\u2019s $330.8 million in Puerto Rico bonds are insured. Neither Robert DiMella nor John Loffredo, the co-heads of muni investments, were available for an interview, she said. Below is a table of the fund companies with the biggest Puerto Rico holdings. Spokespeople or money managers for the funds declined to comment, with the exception of those cited above. The figures are based on the most recent company filings to Bloomberg, except for MacKay, which provided more up-to-date data. The tallies exclude derivatives and debt that\u2019s pre-refunded or escrowed to maturity. Bond values were calculated as position multiplied by market price.

Ericsson, a pioneer in mobile phones that transformed itself into the world\u2019s largest maker of wireless networks, said last Friday that it\u2019s filing seven new lawsuits in an American court and is asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to block Apple products from the U.S. market.  Together, the complaints accuse Apple of infringing as many as 41 patents for some of the fundamental ways mobile devices communicate and for related technology such as user interfaces, battery saving and the operating system.  \u201cWe have offered them a license; they have a turned it down,\u201d said Kasim Alfalahi, Ericsson\u2019s chief intellectual-property officer. \u201cWe\u2019re not a company that\u2019s planning to extract more than the value we put on the table.\u201d  Apple paid royalties to Stockholm-based Ericsson before a license expired in mid-January. When talks over renewal failed, the companies sued each other, seeking court rulings on whether Ericsson\u2019s royalty demands on fundamental technology were fair and reasonable.  \u201cWe\u2019ve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights to standards essential patents covering technology in our products,\u201d Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, we have not been able to agree with Ericsson on a fair rate for their patents so, as a last resort, we are asking the courts for help.\u201d  The new complaints being filed by Ericsson at the International Trade Commission in Washington take the dispute to another level and are designed to put pressure on Apple.

Aereo was backed by Barry Diller and developed with about $95.6 million in equity investments. The assets attracted only $1.55 million at a bankruptcy auction last week.  The company was forced to shut down after a June 25 U.S. Supreme Court decision that the service violated broadcasters\u2019 programming copyright protections. Immediately after the Chapter 11 filing in November, Aereo scheduled an auction, hoping to sell the business to a going-concern buyer.  It didn\u2019t work out that way.  No one was interested in picking up both the equipment and intellectual property. Three buyers ended up winning the auction with combined bids of $1.55 million.  TiVo Inc. made the best bid of $1 million for trademarks, client lists and domain names.  RPX Corp. will get the patents for $225,000, and Alliance Technology Solutions Inc. got the equipment for $320,000.  A hearing to approve the sale is set for March 11.

A federal court in Los Angeles rejected a request by providers of in-flight entertainment to dismiss a copyright lawsuit filed against them by music publishers.  Vivendi SA\u2019s Universal Music and other publishers sued in May 2004, contending that the entertainment providers were using their music without permission or compensation.  Los Angeles-based Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. and other companies claimed their provision of music was a \u201cservice\u201d and, as such, was covered by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. They claimed they couldn\u2019t be sued for copyright infringement.  U.S. District Judge Margaret Morrow disagreed. In a Feb. 23 order, she said any connection between the music service and the deregulation act \u201cis too tenuous and remote to justify preemption.\u201d  She said the conduct at issue was that of a third-party supplier of music to the airlines and the music companies were not seeking \u201cto impose liability on defendants based on any airline policy or procedure.\u201d  The case is UMG Recordings Inc., v.

Solazyme Inc. accused a French company of trade-secret misappropriation in a case involving attempts to create algae-based nutritional products.  The case stems from a joint venture between South San Francisco, California-based Solazyme and Roquette Freres SA of Lestrem, France. The companies are parties to an operating agreement made in November 2010 to conduct research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing of microalgae-derived substances as ingredients for human food, nutraceuticals and animal feed, according to court papers.  After the agreement dissolved, the parties sought arbitration in 2013 as provided in the joint-venture agreement to clarify ownership of intellectual property at issue in the agreement.  An arbitration panel held that Solazyme was entitled to all of the improvements made to intellectual property it brought to the agreement, according to court filings.  Roquette sued in federal court in Delaware in November, seeking a declaration that any award made by the arbitrators was invalid and should be vacated.  The French company also asked the court to declare that it, together with Solazyme, owned the IP assets of Solazyme Roquette Nutritionals LLC.  In its Feb. 26 answer to that complaint, Solazyme said it was the one that brought the IP to the agreement while Roquette\u2019s contribution was mainly financial. Under the terms of an agreement through which Solazyme brought its IP to the venture, Roquette agreed not to reverse-engineer, reproduce or otherwise try to identify the source of the material provided by Solazyme, the California company said in its pleadings.  Solazyme said Roquette violated the agreement and began to file patent applications based on Solazyme\u2019s intellectual property.  Solazyme asked the court to order Roquette to comply with the terms set out by the arbitration panel, including the payment of $2.3 million in fees. Solazyme also asked for money damages and an order barring Roquette\u2019s use of the Solazyme IP.  The case is Roquette Freres SA v. Solazyme Inc., 14-cv-01442, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

Combined, the decisions remove the threat that people who file for bankruptcy in New York will be evicted from valuable apartments even though they\u2019re current on the rent.  A group representing city landlords said the decisions \u201copen the floodgates of imposing unprecedented financial and legal obligations\u201d on \u201cprivate property owners who provide rent-controlled apartments.\u201d  Some New York housing stock is covered by rent-control and rent-stabilization laws dating from World War II. Regulated rents allow thousands of renters to pay sometimes much less than market rates while enjoying protections from eviction.  A woman in New York who filed for bankruptcy was told by a federal judge in September 2012 that the value of her lease was property of the bankruptcy estate that the landlord could buy from the trustee.  The tenant took her case to the federal appeals court in Manhattan. That court asked the state\u2019s highest court, the New York Court of Appeals, to rule on whether the right to live in a rent-stabilized apartment is \u201cproperty\u201d that can be sold.  In November, the state court ruled 5-2 that rent-stabilization rights are an exempt asset as a form of public assistance, which a bankruptcy trustee can\u2019t sell. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and Zachary W. Carter, New York City\u2019s corporation counsel and chief lawyer, have both sided with tenants on the question.  In light of the state-court decision, the Second Circuit ruled Monday that a below-market lease is exempt from creditor claims as a public benefit.  The Rent Stabilization Association of New York City Inc. had urged the federal court not to follow the state court\u2019s decision. The landlord group called the decision a \u201cradical interpretation\u201d that makes the rent-stabilization system \u201ca partial government taking without just compensation.\u201d  The landlords argued that turning a lease into a public benefit might \u201ccreate unforeseen tax consequences for rent-stabilized tenants, in the form of imputed income.\u201d  The case involved a $700-a-month apartment on Manhattan\u2019s East Seventh Street. The landlord offered to buy the lease from the bankruptcy trustee and pay the tenant\u2019s creditors in full. In addition, the landlord offered the tenant $100,000 to move out.  Alternately, the landlord would have let the tenant stay for the rest of her life, but she wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to sublet or allow heirs to take over the apartment at her death.  The case in the federal court is Santiago-Monteverde v. Pereira (In re Santiago-Monteverde), 12-4131, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  Caesars Entertainment Operating Co., while facing opposition to its proposed reorganization plan, asked a bankruptcy judge to approve commitment fees for first-lien noteholders who agree to buy $250 million in preferred stock providing some of the cash for claims.  In filings Sunday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Chicago, Caesars laid out the terms of a backstop agreement by selected first-lien noteholders to purchase the preferred equity offering if others don\u2019t.  Pending bankruptcy court approval, the backstoppers will receive a $15 million fee, based on 5 percent of the $300 million face value of the preferred stock issued by the real estate investment trust to be created by the plan and take ownership of the company\u2019s facilities.  If the plan isn\u2019t put into effect within eight months, another 4 percent fee will be due.  The commitment agreement requires that disclosure materials explaining the plan be approved within five months of bankruptcy. The plan must be approved by a confirmation order within four months after that. The Caesars operating unit filed for bankruptcy in January.  Caesars\u2019 lawyers are due in court Wednesday for a pivotal hearing on the company\u2019s initiatives to appoint an examiner and protect secured lenders. The hearing will also determine whether Caesars can disband an official committee formed to represent holders of $5.24 billion in second-lien notes.  On Monday, Caesars announced financial results for the fourth quarter and 2014. The company had a $452 million operating loss and a $2.77 billion net loss on revenue of $8.52 billion for the year.  The balance sheet, to be repaired in Chapter 11, remains upside down, with liabilities exceeding the $23.5 billion of assets by $4.74 billion. For Bloomberg coverage, click here.

Caesars inducted itself voluntarily into Chapter 11 on Jan. 15 in Chicago, three days after several second-lien noteholders filed an involuntary petition in Delaware. Caesars entered with a proposed reorganization plan, opposed by junior noteholders, under which the non-bankrupt parent Caesars Entertainment Corp. would make a $1.5 billion contribution in return for releases of claims.  Caesars Entertainment Operating has 38 of the combined companies\u2019 50 casinos in five countries and 14 states. It listed assets of $12.4 billion and debt totaling $19.9 billion. The parent isn\u2019t in bankruptcy.  Caesars was named Harrah\u2019s Entertainment Inc. before the $27.2 billion leveraged buyout in January 2008 by Apollo Management LP and TPG Inc. There was a public offering in February 2012 where Apollo and TPG retained control.  The case is In re Caesars Entertainment Operating Co.

RadioShack Corp., the 4,100-store electronics retailer that filed for Chapter 11 last month, will have to overcome opposition from the U.S. Trustee before implementing a $2 million bonus program for eight top executives.  The program was designed to reward the executives with bonuses that aren\u2019t tied to any measurable incentives related to the sale process, the Justice Department\u2019s bankruptcy watchdog said in a Feb. 28 court filing.  At the outset of bankruptcy, the threshold for executives to earn $500,000 of the bonus pool was already met because the so-called stalking horse deal with Standard General LP for about half of the chain\u2019s stores was signed, the U.S. Trustee said.  The degree of difficulty to achieve the remaining two bonuses of $750,000 each is \u201cnot capable of calibration,\u201d according to the U.S. Trustee, who said the benchmarks may be \u201clay-ups.\u201d  A hearing on the executive bonuses as well as a separate $1 million retention bonus pool for 30 lower-level managers is scheduled for Wednesday.

The Grapevine, Texas-based retailer of video games will pay $15,000 for each lease it eventually agrees to buy, along with specified occupancy costs.  The court also permitted sales of individual store leases with prices ranging from about $20,000 to $42,000.  Also on Friday, the judge approved the sale of some leases back to landlords, with varying purchase prices to be paid for termination of the leases and surrender of the properties.  The judge already gave final approval to liquidators to run going-out-of-business sales at locations that are closing.  The Fort Worth, Texas-based retailer\u2019s Feb. 5 Chapter 11 petition listed assets of $1.2 billion and debt of $1.39 billion. Liabilities include $250 million to hedge-fund manager Standard General on an asset-backed loan. Salus Capital Partners LLC and affiliate Cerberus Capital Management are owed $250 million on a second-lien term loan. There\u2019s $330 million owing on 6.75 percent senior unsecured notes.  RadioShack had revenue of $2.06 billion over the first three quarters of 2014, a $314.5 million operating loss and a $396.8 million net loss.  The case is In re RadioShack Corp., 15-bk-10197, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  A bank that defeated a man\u2019s Chapter 13 debt-adjustment plan will ask the U.S. Supreme Court April 1 to reject the notion that there\u2019s more flexibility in permitting bankruptcy appeals.  If the bank wins, and depending on how the high court writes its opinion, fewer rulings by bankruptcy judges may be automatically appealable.  The decision will probably also establish when appeals can be taken in business reorganizations under Chapter 11. Fewer permissible appeals would enhance the power of bankruptcy judges at a time when the Supreme Court generally has been restricting the clout of those courts.  In Bullard v. Blue Hills Bank, a bankruptcy judge refused to approve an individual\u2019s Chapter 13 plan, which would have required paying a portion of claims over five years before receiving a discharge wiping out the remaining liabilities. Having lost on the first appeal to a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, the bankrupt turned to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston.  Although the bankrupt contended no other plan was feasible, the First Circuit dismissed the appeal, concluding that denial of confirmation wasn\u2019t a final order required by Section 158 of the Judiciary Code. The Supreme Court took the case because five circuit courts refuse to hear appeals from denials of confirmation in Chapter 13, while three permit them.  Supported by the U.S. solicitor general, the bankrupt filed his brief in January, arguing that denial of confirmation was appealable as of right because it finally determined a discrete dispute within the larger bankruptcy.  In a brief filed last week, the bank argued that the finality rule in bankruptcy is no different from other appeals in federal court. Adopting a more \u201cflexible finality\u201d would undermine the statutory structure by \u201crendering largely superfluous the specific statutory scheme governing interlocutory appeals in bankruptcy,\u201d the bank said.  When an important ruling that\u2019s not final deserves immediate appeal, Section 158 has a safety valve allowing so-called interlocutory appeals with permission from the court, the bank said. That mechanism should be used, rather than altering the overall notion of finality, according to the bank. An interlocutory appeal is one from an order that\u2019s not otherwise considered \u201cfinal.\u201d  The case will turn on Section 158(a)(1), which says there\u2019s a right of appeal from a \u201cfinal\u201d order in bankruptcy \u201ccases and proceedings.\u201d The solicitor general, the government\u2019s representative in the Supreme Court, said that statute is broader than those governing non-bankruptcy appeals because it allows appeals from \u201cproceedings.\u201d  The bank countered that a proceeding regarding a plan is \u201cfinal\u201d only when the plan is confirmed or the entire bankruptcy is dismissed.  Not all banks agree with Blue Hills, which won in the lower courts. Bank of America NA filed a friend-of-the-court brief advocating automatic appeals.

Blue Hills Bank, 14-116, U.S. Supreme Court (Washington).  After getting bids for various assets at auction totaling only $1.55 million, non-operating Aereo Inc. filed a Chapter 11 plan Friday offering undetermined recoveries to unsecured creditors.  A hearing to consider an approval of explanatory disclosure materials, filed alongside the plan, is set for April 1. May 19 would be the date for a plan-approval hearing.  The proposed plan would create a liquidating trust for distributions to creditors. Priority claims and so-called convenience claims will be paid in full under the plan.  From available cash, general unsecured claims are expected to be paid \u201cin part,\u201d except for creditors who benefit from the subordination of other creditors\u2019 claims, according to Aereo. The estimated recovery for this voting class is to be determined, according to the disclosure statement.  Holders of subordinated claims, also entitled to vote, will get distributions under the plan only if there\u2019s cash available after full payment to higher-ranked creditors.  Shareholders aren\u2019t expected to get any distributions under the plan, so they\u2019re deemed to reject it.  Backed by Barry Diller, Aereo was forced to shut down after the Supreme Court ruled on June 25 that its service violated broadcasters\u2019 programming copyright protections. Immediately after the Chapter 11 filing in November, the Boston-based company scheduled an auction, hoping to sell the business to a going-concern buyer.  Three buyers ended up winning the February auction. TiVo Inc. made the best bid of $1 million for trademarks, client lists, and domain names. RPX Corp. will buy patents for $225,000, and Alliance Technology Solutions Inc. got equipment for $320,000. The sale-approval hearing is set for March 11.  Developed with approximately $95.6 million in equity investments, Aereo listed assets of $20.5 million and liabilities totaling $4.2 million, not including liabilities for copyright infringement. There is no secured debt.  The case is In re Aereo Inc., 14-bk-13200, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  Samson Investment Co., the owner of an oil and gas development and production company, has an \u201cuntenable interest burden\u201d along with \u201cexceptionally heavy debt service relative to cash flow,\u201d Moody\u2019s Investors Service said on Monday in the course of issuing downgrades.  Moody\u2019s lowered the corporate rating three grades to Caa3, while the senior unsecured note rating fell to Ca.  Low commodity prices are not conducive to reducing debt with asset sales, Moody\u2019s said.  Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Samson is controlled by KKR & Co. LP, as the result of a $7.2 billion acquisition in December 2011, Moody\u2019s said.  GrafTech International Ltd., a supplier of graphite electrodes for the steel industry, saw its stock surge 20.8 percent in Monday\u2019s trading after announcing a new credit agreement and fourth quarter financial results.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service nonetheless issued a downgrade, lowering the corporate rating one step to Ba3. The senior unsecured notes of the Parma, Ohio-based company went down one level also to B1.  Moody\u2019s attributed the downgrade to oversupply in the industry and uncertainty resulting from another proxy contest.  The stock closed yesterday at $4.71 in New York trading. In the last three years, the high was $12.97 on Jan. 16, 2014. The low in the period was $3.58 on Oct. 9, 2014.  Trying to save a few bucks on fees owed to the U.S. Trustee, a couple who had been in Chapter 11 found themselves unprotected when a secured lender foreclosed.  The couple got a confirmation order approving their Chapter 11 plan. To avoid paying quarterly U.S. Trustee fees, they prevailed on the judge to close the case even though payments under the plan weren\u2019t completed and they hadn\u2019t been granted a discharge.  When they failed to pay a lender, the bank successfully sued in state court to enforce the plan and assert rights in some of the bankrupt\u2019s property. Later, the bankrupts reopened their Chapter 11 case and sued the bank for violating the so-called automatic stay and intruding on the bankruptcy court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over the plan.  The bankruptcy judge ruled against them, as did the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel in Denver.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Janice Miller Karlin said the result flowed from a \u201csimple reading\u201d of two provisions in the Bankruptcy Code, Sections 362(c)(1) and 1141(b).  The former dissolves the stay when property no longer belongs to the estate. Section 1141(b) provides that property on confirmation re-vests in the debtors. Consequently, the property was no longer protected by the stay after confirmation because it had been taken out of the estate and vested in the individual bankrupts.  Karlin also ruled that the bankruptcy court didn\u2019t have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from the plan.  The case is Rael v. Wells Fargo Bank NA (In re Rael), 14-035, U.S. Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (Denver).  A bank represented by lawyers in a Chapter 13 case has no excuse for failing to file a claim by the deadline, according to Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Cecelia G. Morris in New York.  Although the mortgage lender filed a timely objection to approval of a Chapter 13 plan, the bank didn\u2019t file a claim by the deadline. Later, the bank asked Morris to take the plan objection as an informal proof of claim.  The judge declined in an opinion March 2.  The bank first argued for a post-hoc expansion of the claim-filing deadline, based on excusable neglect. Morris said that enlargement of time to file a claim is governed by Bankruptcy Rule 3002(c), which has six exceptions to the 90-day deadline. Excusable neglect is not one of them, Morris said.  Consequently, Morris ruled that the excusable neglect standard in Rule 9006(b)(1) doesn\u2019t apply to claim-filing deadlines.  Next, the bank importuned Morris to view the plan objection as an informal claim. Morris said the bank didn\u2019t meet the fifth test for deeming another document as an informal claim.  The fifth test inquires whether it would be equitable to treat the plan objection as a proof of claim. Morris said it wouldn\u2019t.  The judge said that the fifth prong of the informal claim rule \u201cwas not meant to legitimize what would otherwise be considered sloppy legal practice.\u201d On that issue, she said the bank was represented by lawyers \u201cwell aware of the need to file a timely proof of claim.\u201d  Refusing to allow a late claim didn\u2019t visit prejudice on the bank, because the lender still had a secured claim, Morris said. Disallowing an unsecured claim only precluded the bank from participating as an unsecured creditors for any deficiency in the collateral.

It\u2019s Flight 370, he thought -- the Malaysia Airlines plane that had vanished 364 days earlier. A camera was raced down to confirm that the aircraft\u2019s wreckage had been found. Satellite Internet on the search vessels was cut off to prevent the news from leaking. \u201cWe thought, \u2018We might have solved this,\u2019\u201d Kennedy, a deputy managing director at search operators Fugro NV, said in an interview. \u201cIt was the right size, the right shape.\u201d The cameras brought back the truth: No wreckage, just volcanic boulders and starfish crawling over a silty sea floor. At Fugro\u2019s operations center, surrounded by mallee-tree scrub in the northern suburbs of Perth, Australia, analysts who\u2019ve been clicking through orange-and-yellow sonar images in search of the plane since last October aren\u2019t deterred. \u201cMost people come to work and think, \u2018Maybe today\u2019s the day,\u2019\u201d said Steve Duffield, the local managing director for Leidschendam, Netherlands-based Fugro. \u201cWe\u2019re a long way ahead, because now we know where the plane isn\u2019t.\u201d While investigators try to understand why a Germanwings pilot deliberately crashed his flight on March 24, the current search for Malaysian Airline System Bhd.\u2019s Flight 370 is winding down with no answers about the fate of the 239 people on board. Australia\u2019s A$39 million ($30 million) contract with Fugro runs through August 2016, but Australia, Malaysia and China haven\u2019t agreed on funding for any further searching after May. Government ministers are slated to meet to discuss the issue later this month, a spokesman for Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said by e-mail. More than 60 percent of the main search zone has been scanned without finding any sign of the Boeing Co. 777-200. The rest of the zone should be analyzed more quickly, Duffield said, allowing searchers to finish the task before the end of May, when the seas become too rough to navigate. Fugro, which mostly surveys the seabed for oil and gas and telecommunications-cable companies, has nearly 200 people dedicated to the search, including two 30-person crews on each of its three search vessels. Fewer than 20 people sit at desks here in Perth, carrying out more detailed analysis of the roughly 10 objects a week deemed worthy of further study. Hopes still run high among members of the team. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in the right spot -- all the analysis has been done,\u201d Kennedy said, examining a spare sonar submersible in a quiet warehouse two minutes\u2019 drive from the operations center. \u201cIt\u2019s actually getting more exciting as we get closer.\u201d Duffield, who expects that the search will indeed continue beyond the current stage, is already fitting out his ships to handle winter weather further to the north, where seas are calmer. The main question at this stage is whether Flight 370 glided for longer than expected after it ran out of fuel, or plunged into the sea further north than assumed, Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, said in a March 27 interview. It\u2019s \u201cpossible but highly unlikely\u201d that one of the pilots was flying the plane to the end, said Dolan, the main government official responsible for the hunt. \u201cOur assumption, based on the evidence available to us, is crew incapacitation,\u201d he said by phone from Canberra. \u201cThere was no one actually at the controls.\u201d If the plane isn\u2019t found by late May and funds permit further investigation, \u201cwe would move further north, but we\u2019d also have to contemplate whether we would go wider\u201d from the place where fuel ran out, Dolan said. For the moment, Duffield is focused on filling in gaps that amount to four or five percent of the 36,000 square kilometers scanned so far. Eyeballing the images is still the most reliable way of spotting debris, said Magnus Windle, the team\u2019s lead geophysicist. \u201cWe\u2019ve logged hundreds of contacts, and 99 percent of them look like that,\u201d he said, pointing to a yellow smudge on his computer screen that indicates an object sticking above the seafloor. \u201cThe plane\u2019s not going to be sitting there as a beautiful silhouette with two engines and a tailfin and everything else.

Cohn was on a short list of potential candidates to succeed Mohamed El-Erian as chief executive officer, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. At the time, Pimco and Bill Gross were working on a succession plan that included a smaller role for Gross, who co-founded the firm in 1971, the people said. A move by Cohn would have deprived Lloyd C. Blankfein of his top deputy and one of his most likely successors. Cohn, 54, the only bank employee other than Blankfein on the board of directors, is considered among a group of executives who could replace the 60-year-old CEO when he retires. In an October 2013 Bloomberg Television interview, Cohn said he was happy in his   and wanted to remain in it. While Pimco\u2019s idea of hiring Cohn never progressed beyond informal conversations, he stood to increase his compensation substantially. Pimco   El-Erian a bonus of about $230 million in 2013 as part of an executive profit-sharing plan as the firm\u2019s assets approached $2 trillion. Cohn was awarded $26.9 million for 2013, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index, which values an executive\u2019s compensation as of the company\u2019s fiscal year end. Since 2012, he\u2019s taken home about $61.7 million, which includes salary and cash bonuses, as well as vested stock and exercised options that were granted in previous years, the index shows. Mark Porterfield, a spokesman for Newport Beach, California-based Pimco, declined to comment. Cohn, who is based in New York, declined to comment through a spokesman. Pimco\u2019s unofficial search for the next leader of the $1.6 trillion asset manager was marred by internal turmoil, ending in the departures of both El-Erian and Gross last year. The upheaval spurred record redemptions at the firm in 2014 and prompted a reshuffling of management amid declining returns in the bond market. El-Erian, who also shared the role of co-chief investment officer with Gross, informed Pimco in late 2013 that he was going to leave, and Gross offered to step back instead, Bloomberg News   in December. El-Erian, a contributor to Bloomberg View, stuck with his decision and on Jan. 21, 2014, announced his resignation. Pimco overhauled its management after El-Erian left, naming Douglas Hodge CEO and creating six deputy CIOs who reported to Gross. Still, tensions within the firm worsened. By September, Gross\u2019s clashes with management created a divide that eventually forced him to leave rather than suffer the indignity of being fired.

It was the early 1980s, and though the family lived in a middle-class neighborhood, they didn\u2019t have a telephone, automobile or television. There was no way to get the results other than to retrieve them in person. Pichai had to take a city bus two and a half hours across town to the hospital and wait in a long line. When the results weren\u2019t ready, he returned home empty-handed. In the U.S., \u201ctechnology happens so fast, change is more continuous for people and sometimes they don\u2019t internalize it,\u201d he said in a Bloomberg Businessweek interview in 2014. \u201cFor me, it happened in these discrete moments.\u201d From that relatively hard-scrabble upbringing (his family got around by piling onto a Lambretta scooter,) Pichai attended the Indian Institute of Technology, won a scholarship to Stanford University, worked at the early Silicon Valley blue chip Applied Materials Inc. and joined Google Inc. as a product manager working on the toolbar, an important early window into Google\u2019s services that appeared on the top of Web browsers like Internet Explorer. That was 10 years ago. On Monday, Pichai, 43, was tapped to be chief executive officer of Google itself, the dominant unit of the new holding company Alphabet Inc., a stunningly rapid ascent to the top echelon of U.S. business. Now comes the hard part. His new role will be about positioning Google for the future, which hands him some of the toughest jobs in all of tech -- like shifting the profit engine from the desktop to mobile and combating the rapid growth of Amazon.com Inc. in e-commerce and cloud computing and Facebook Inc. in social networking. \u201cThe challenge is how to sustain revenue growth and profit enhancement in the face of slowing search growth,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group LLC. \u201cWhen you are 90 percent of the market, it\u2019s hard to get much bigger.\u201d The promotion announced Monday was the latest for an Indian-born executive in technology, with Satya Nadella named CEO of Microsoft Corp. in 2014 and George Kurian appointed CEO of storage company NetApp Inc. in June. Kurian\u2019s twin brother Thomas Kurian is president of product development at Oracle Corp., while Shantanu Narayen is CEO of Adobe Systems Inc. Pichai\u2019s rise says a lot about the newly globalized world, the spread of productivity enhancing technology and the way Larry Page sees the future of the company he co-founded. The new structure allows Page and his co-founder, Sergey Brin, to focus on the moonshots, like life-saving technologies at Calico and Internet-spreading gadgets at the Google X division. Never one to embrace the formal duties of running a tech giant, Page prefers to look beyond the pillars in front of him, so he can position Google for the future. That has led him to gradually hand off more duties to his most trusted lieutenants. \u201cIn the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant,\u201d Page wrote in a  . Over the past few years, no lieutenant has been as trusted as Pichai. He launched the Chrome browser, took over the Android operating system and, barely a year later, all of Google consumer products, save for YouTube. In the process, Pichai proved himself an effective product manager who shipped on time and a peacemaker inside Google and with partners like telcos and media companies. He also demonstrated an encyclopedic knowledge of Google\u2019s products and businesses. \u201cHe\u2019s basically committed to memory almost every statistical fact about Google and can extract details about those facts,\u201d said Alan Eustace, a former Google senior executive, last year. Pichai\u2019s father, R.S. Pichai, a retired engineer who once oversaw the factory floor for a company that made electrical relays, said he used to speak with his older son about his job and its challenges. \u201cEven at a young age,\u201d the father said in an e-mail last year, \u201che was curious about my work, and I think that really attracted him to technology.\u201d In Sundar\u2019s senior year of high school, he competed in the National Talent Search Examination (which included tests in mathematics and science) and received a scholarship awarded to only 750 students nationally. He got a coveted spot at IIT, but the family\u2019s true sacrifice came when he won the scholarship to Stanford in 1993. While the senior Pichai remembers making careful preparations to furnish Sundar with the 25,000 rupee for airfare, plus additional expenses for living, his son recalls that his parents basically ransacked their bank account to send him to the U.S. \u201cMy dad and my mom did what a lot of parents did at time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey sacrificed a lot of their life and used a lot of their disposable income to make sure the children were educated.\u201d In the U.S. for the first time, Pichai immediately commented that the fields looked remarkably brown (\u201c\u2018no, they\u2019re golden\u2019\u201d, he said his host family corrected him) and started missing his girlfriend Anjali, back home (she\u2019s now his wife and mother of their two kids.) At Stanford, he got unfettered access to computers, and to the Internet, for the first time. The rest is history. He talked last year about the necessity of making dramatic changes in life, and in business. \u201cI believe we have clear momentum but the ground underneath is constantly shifting and evolving,\u201d he said. \u201cEither you adapt, and you are at the forefront and you drive this.

In laying out a possible scenario for management of the combined company, Harrison said Jim Squires could be tapped to run either Canadian Pacific or Norfolk Southern. Keith Creel, chief operating officer at Canadian Pacific, could be put in charge of the other railroad and Harrison would head up the parent company.\u00a0 Canadian Pacific asked Norfolk management for a price it would accept but didn\u2019t receive a response, Harrison\u00a0said in a webcast presentation at a UBS Group AG conference in Boca Raton, Florida, on Thursday. Harrison said he met once with\u00a0Squires for about two-and-a-half hours and they haven\u2019t talked again. Harrison expressed willingness to find a price for Norfolk Southern to make the deal work. Other\u00a0issues, such as where the headquarters will be located and who gets what position, can be worked out, he said. Norfolk Southern is \u201cnot quite ready\u201d to talk, prompting Harrison to negotiate through the media, he said.

Harrison said Norfolk Southern\u2019s operating ratio -- an   measure in which a lower number is better -- could fall to as low as 59 percent. Its ratio was about 70 percent in the third quarter. Approval of a merger shouldn\u2019t take long because there are little overlapping operations, no environmental concerns and shippers\u2019 concerns will be allayed, Harrison said. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to address every issue that I know the shipping public has had,\u201d he said.

The buyer plans to finance the purchase with $2 billion of debt and by issuing as much as $800 million in equity, the companies said in a statement Tuesday. The deal for Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie is expected to be completed in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval, the companies said. Verisk, formed in 1971 as an association of property-casualty insurers to gather industry data, has been expanding through acquisitions since its 2009 initial public offering to provide information to credit-card and health companies. Chief Executive Officer Scott Stephenson has been pushing the Jersey City, New Jersey-based company to grow beyond the U.S. and enter new lines of business. \u201cWood Mac could leverage Verisk\u2019s property-information, aerial-imagery and weather-climate capabilities and help build out its supply chain solutions,\u201d Jeffrey P. Meuler, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a March 2 note. Wood Mackenzie provides research and consulting and has offices in locations including Beijing, London, Dubai, Calgary, Houston, New York and Moscow, according to its  . The company reported 2014 revenue of 227 million pounds and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 107 million pounds. The deal is Verisk\u2019s biggest since acquiring Argus Information & Advisory Services LLC for $425 million in 2012 to gather data from credit-card issuers and retail banks and benefit from the growth of the payments market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stephenson favors businesses that gain from scale as he assembles databases that can be sold to subscribers. He said Verisk can raise prices on the anniversary of contracts and sell additional services to its clients. \u201cThis model is very similar to that of Argus,\u201d Stephenson said of Wood Mac on a conference call.  Verisk slipped 0.5 percent to $70.98 at 9:48 a.m. in New York, after jumping more than 11 percent this year through Monday. Wood Mackenzie CEO Stephen Halliday will continue to lead the business, reporting to Stephenson. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. advised Verisk and are acting as joint lead arrangers on $2.9 billion of bridge financing. Verisk said it doesn\u2019t expect to need to use that facility. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is the company\u2019s law firm on the deal. Deutsche Bank AG and Lazard Ltd. are Wood Mackenzie\u2019s bankers, while Dickson Minto WS was legal adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP advised the selling private equity funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman and Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP. Hellman & Friedman acquired a 63 percent stake in the Edinburgh-based company in a 2012   that valued it at 1.1 billion pounds. Verisk had planned a $650 million takeover of EagleView Technology Corp. Stephenson scrapped the deal in December after antitrust regulators said the purchase would give Verisk too large a share in the market for aerial images used by insurers. The company said at the time that it would instead repurchase $500 million of shares. McGraw Hill Financial Inc., the parent of Standard & Poor\u2019s, was among bidders for Wood Mackenzie, the Financial Times said on Feb. 28, citing people familiar with the talks. \u201cHad we not acted now, acquiring Wood Mac would be more expensive, or perhaps impossible, in the future,\u201d Stephenson said. He said prospect of competitive bidding or a potential Wood Mac initial public offering spurred Verisk\u2019s offer, even as a plunge in oil prices rattled the energy industry.","timestamp":1425975902.0,"participant_ids":["VRSK:US","6902Z:US","7533148Z:AU"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-10\/verisk-analytics-to-buy-wood-mackenzie-for-2-8-billion","subject":"Verisk to Buy Hellman & Friedman\u2019s Wood Mac for $2.8 Billion"},{"body":" Twitter Inc. said it is seeking a chief executive who can make a full-time commitment to the company, ruling out interim chief Jack Dorsey as long as he remains in the top job at Square Inc. Twitter\u2019s board hired executive search firm Spencer Stuart to help find its next CEO, the San Francisco-based social-media company said in a statement Monday. The search is proceeding with a sense of urgency, but the committee will take the time necessary to find the right CEO, Twitter said in the statement. Dorsey, who became interim chief executive this month, also runs Square, a digital-payments company he co-founded in 2009.

Jim McCormick, the London-based global head of asset allocation research, and Sharon Casey, a managing director for interest rate sales in New York, were among the departures, said the person, who asked not to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. Barclays, which is losing its grip on Europe\u2019s fixed-income market to U.S. competitors, is trimming those operations as regulation makes trading debt less lucrative. Even with the bank\u2019s macro group, which includes currencies and interest-rate sales and trading, posting a 10 percent increase in revenue in the second quarter, Chairman John McFarlane plans to focus on debt and equity capital markets businesses. James White, a London-based spokesman for Barclays, declined to comment. McCormick declined to comment. E-mails to Casey weren\u2019t immediately returned. Casey had been with the bank for more than a decade, while McCormick joined from hedge fund Comac Capital in 2013. The cuts are part of former Chief Executive Officer Antony Jenkins\u2019s plan to cut 7,000 jobs at the investment bank by 2016, with reductions mostly taking place at the director and managing director level, the person said. The securities units employed 20,500 globally as of the end of 2014. So far, the revamp of the investment bank has helped boost the shares. Barclays has risen 18 percent this year, making it the top-performing major U.K. bank stock. The lender reported a 8.8 percent increase in profit in the second quarter, driven by its investment bank, which had a 35 percent jump in earnings. Jonathan Fischer, who worked in European credit sales in London, also left the bank as part of the cuts, said two different people with knowledge of his departure. Fischer didn\u2019t immediately respond to calls and emails. While fixed income is being cut back, Barclays has bolstered its advisory and debt arm, making senior hires in areas where it anticipates a competitive advantage. The bank added Barry Meyers from JPMorgan Chase & Co. as head of the U.K. equity capital markets team. He started this month as a director, a rank above his title at JPMorgan. Barclays also hired Philip Shelley in February from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was co-head of U.K. corporate broking. Barclays has added at least eight managing directors in the U.S. so far this year, with three of those in telecommunications, media and technology, including Peter Cohen, hired from Blackstone Group LP to run media banking. The British lender also cut employees from its European asset-backed securities unit in London this week, according to three people familiar with the matter. Chris Carnell, head of European ABS sales, and Stuart Calnan, head of European ABS trading are no longer with the bank.","timestamp":1438329579.0,"participant_ids":["BARC:LN","BARC:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-31\/barclays-said-to-cut-150-at-investment-bank-as-mccormick-departs","subject":"Barclays Said to Cut 150 at Investment Bank; McCormick Exits"},{"body":" Employers in the U.S. probably added workers in May at a pace that may keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise borrowing costs later this year, data this week may show.

BNSF Railway Executive Chairman Matt Rose is open to making a competing offer for Norfolk Southern Corp., the company targeted by Canadian Pacific, and CSX Corp. also would be \u201cvery much in play.\u201d While BNSF doesn\u2019t favor fresh dealmaking, the carrier won\u2019t be sidelined if any occurs, Rose said Thursday in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve never in this industry just done one merger,\u201d said Rose, 56, who moved into his current post in 2014 after serving as chief executive officer since 2002. \u201cYou do a merger and then somebody else announces it because of this issue of stabilization of the industry and parity in various markets.\u201d BNSF\u2019s willingness to pursue a tie-up underscores the potential challenge for the  , which would have to evaluate any deal. There have been no major U.S. rail mergers for more than 15 years, and the STB has new, untested rules requiring that it evaluate possible follow-on combinations as part of its regulatory review. CSX and Norfolk Southern both were bright spots for the U.S. stock market Friday, when major indexes slumped. CSX rose 4.1 percent, the most in three months, to $25.72 at the close in New York while Norfolk Southern gained 2 percent to $89.44. Norfolk Southern has snubbed Canadian Pacific, which wants to create a cross-border, coast-to-coast carrier in a North American industry dominated by six railroads: Norfolk Southern and CSX compete east of the Mississippi; Calgary-based Canadian Pacific vies with Canadian National Railway Co.; and BNSF goes head to head with Union Pacific Corp. in the western U.S. Tony Hatch, a former Wall Street analyst who tracked many of the 1990s mergers that created the modern industry, said Rose\u2019s comments were intended to slow down any rush to a round of deals that would shrink the industry\u2019s ranks. \u201cWe\u2019re at this stage where everybody is saying, \u2018Look if this happens it\u2019s going to be kind of a big thing and not necessarily a good thing,\u2019 \u201d said Hatch,\u00a0who now runs ABH Consulting. \u201cMatt\u2019s move is a warning in order to prevent that.\u201d Spokesmen for Norfolk Southern, Canadian Pacific and CSX declined to comment on Rose\u2019s remarks, while Union Pacific\u2019s Aaron Hunt said, \u201cWe oppose rail industry mergers in the current environment and believe the regulatory hurdles for future consolidation would be significant.\u201d Putting Canadian Pacific together with Norfolk Southern would leave Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX at a disadvantage, inevitably making that railroad a target as well, Rose said. Canadian Pacific sees $1.8 billion in merger benefits from a Norfolk Southern deal, which \u201cquite frankly creates an uneven, unstable railroad network with CSX,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got two railroads in the west that would be looking at, \u2018Should one of us jump in with the NS assets or should the other one jump in on the CSX assets?\u2019 \u201d Rose said. A BNSF offer for Norfolk, Virginia-based Norfolk Southern would be akin to Union Pacific\u2019s efforts to step in during the 1990s to \u201cprovide a competitive bid when the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe were merging,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIf there is consolidation to be had, we would participate as well.\u201d Buffett completed his purchase of Fort Worth, Texas-based BNSF in 2010, a transaction valued at about $34 billion that he described as a bet on the U.S. economy because of railroads\u2019 vital role in moving freight. BNSF could bring considerable resources to bear in future consolidation. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire had more than $66 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter. While there haven\u2019t been any combinations among major North American carriers in the 21st century, BNSF does \u201cscenario planning every year,\u201d Rose said. Rose said shippers don\u2019t support large deals.

The U.S. railroad, which rejected its suitor\u2019s revised proposal on Monday, hasn\u2019t engaged in negotiations, Harrison said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to talk turkey,\u201d he said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to talk to us, or we\u2019re going to have to take another tactic.\u201d Since Norfolk Southern hasn\u2019t agreed to discuss the proposal, a proxy battle \u201csure seems\u201d likely, Harrison said in the interview with\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s Erik Schatzker. Harrison, 71, wants to create a transcontinental railroad by combining Canada\u2019s second-largest carrier with the No. 2 operator in the eastern U.S.\u00a0Canadian Pacific   its bid last week, offering Norfolk Southern shareholders $32.86 in cash and 0.451 share of stock. That indicates a value of $27 billion based on Canadian Pacific\u2019s closing price last Monday. Harrison has been rebuffed twice by the Norfolk, Virginia-based carrier. Norfolk Southern\u00a0said in a regulatory filing Monday that the premium offered by Canadian Pacific was too small and the merger and the voting trust proposed wouldn\u2019t be approved by regulators. Canadian Pacific remains convinced that the combination and the trust would be approved by U.S. regulators, according to a person familiar with the railway\u2019s thinking. If the voting trust is rejected by regulators, very little would be lost in pursing the matter, outside of legal fees, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.\u00a0And if the merger is ultimately rejected, Norfolk Southern or Canadian Pacific would simply be spun out to shareholders as a special dividend, the person said. Harrison said Monday that a different instrument beyond the cash-and-stock offer could allow the Calgary-based railroad to \u201csweeten the pot.\u201d He suggested a contingent value right, a tool that gives holders of an acquired company additional benefits if a specified event occurs, subject to an expiration date. \u201cIt, to some degree, brackets the upside and downside of the offer, and if there is in some people\u2019s view, certain risks, it modifies the risk,\u201d he said. Canadian Pacific can\u2019t overpay for Norfolk Southern \u201cbecause we don\u2019t think the value\u2019s there.\u201d Canadian Pacific \u201ccannot lose sight of who we\u2019re representing here,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThat\u2019s the CP shareholders here. We\u2019re not going to dilute their position. We\u2019re not going to pay $150 or whatever.\u201d Norfolk Southern shares closed little changed at $89.35 in New York, while Canadian Pacific fell less than 1 percent to C$169.08 in Toronto. \u201cWe\u2019ve made some breakthrough with the shareholders,\u201d Harrison said in the interview, at his horse farm in Florida. \u201cOur polling says they\u2019re very interested in the transaction. We\u2019d love to sit down with Norfolk Southern.\u201d\u00a0 The way Harrison sees it, the odds of a deal going forward are in Canadian Pacific\u2019s favor. \u201cMy personal view is, it\u2019s better than 50-50,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a slam dunk. We\u2019ve certainly got some challenges ahead of us.\u201d\u00a0A Norfolk Southern spokesman declined to comment on Harrison\u2019s remarks. Harrison also said he doesn\u2019t expect that the railroad controlled by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. will jump into the contest. BNSF Railway Chairman Matt Rose said last week he would be open to making   for Norfolk Southern -- comments that didn\u2019t sit well with the Canadian Pacific CEO. \u201cMatt\u2019s a good friend of mine, he\u2019s trying to muddy the water, I think.\u00a0I\u2019m not saying they couldn\u2019t do it if they want to. They\u2019re just not prepared and don\u2019t have the team in my view to do it,\u201d Harrison said.\u00a0\u201cFor Matt just to get on and start throwing statements around is a little irresponsible.\u201d A BNSF spokesman didn\u2019t have an immediate comment. Canadian Pacific has maintained that Norfolk Southern would benefit even during regulatory review, which is expected to last as many as two years, if Harrison was able to run the railroad as he has proposed. He gained a reputation for improving the efficiency of Canadian Pacific since taking the helm in 2012 and at Canadian National Railway Co. and Illinois Central before that.","timestamp":1450092472.0,"participant_ids":["CP:CN","NSC:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-14\/cp-s-harrison-says-time-to-talk-turkey-with-norfolk-on-deal","subject":"CP's Harrison Says `Time to Talk Turkey' With Norfolk on Deal"},{"body":"Verisk Analytics Inc., the provider of data to insurers and banks, was named to join the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index after the company\u2019s market value passed $12 billion on a share rally and expansion through acquisitions.

The Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against the companies and is seeking an order in federal court to block the merger pending the administrative proceeding, it said in a   Thursday. \u201cThis proposed merger would eliminate significant competition in the marketplace and create a dominant national broadline foodservice distributor,\u201d said Debbie Feinstein, the director of the agency\u2019s Bureau of Competition. Sysco fell 3.4 percent to close at $38.56 in New York. The FTC\u2019s case is a blow to Sysco, which offered to sell assets to satisfy antitrust concerns and had aimed to close the transaction late last year after announcing the deal in December 2013. The company, which says it will fight the FTC\u2019s case, has hired Washington antitrust lawyer Rich Parker of O\u2019Melveny & Myers LLP to defend the merger. \u201cThe facts are strongly in our favor and we look forward to making our case in court,\u201d Sysco Chief Executive Officer Bill Delaney said in a statement. \u201cThose of us who work in this industry every day know it is fiercely competitive.\u201d Sysco, based in Houston, made a   attempt to persuade the FTC to clear the deal after agency staff rebuffed the company\u2019s offer to sell 11 US Foods facilities with $4.6 billion in sales to Performance Food Group to preserve competition. Sysco presented its case directly to the agency\u2019s five commissioners, who have the final say on whether to sue to block a merger. The commission voted 3-2 to issue the complaint. Ten state attorneys general joined the FTC\u2019s case, including California, Illinois, Minnesota and Ohio, in addition to the District of Columbia. The FTC rejected Sysco\u2019s settlement proposal because Performance Food Group wouldn\u2019t be able to replace US Foods even with the addition of new facilities, Feinstein said in an interview. \u201cWe are concerned that they don\u2019t have the capacity or operational capabilities to serve national customers as effectively,\u201d she said. Feinstein declined to comment on whether Sysco could improve its offer to resolve the agency\u2019s concerns. Sysco agreed to spend $3 billion in common stock and $500 million in cash for US Foods, creating a combined company with sales of $65 billion. Private-equity firms KKR & Co. and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC own Rosemont, Illinois-based US Foods after buying it for $7 billion from Royal Ahold NV in 2007. Sysco and US Foods are the largest companies in the so-called broadline foodservice market, where customers include schools, hospitals, restaurants and hotels. The merged company would account for 75 percent of the national market, reducing competition across the country and in 32 local markets, the FTC said. The FTC and the Justice Department, which share antitrust enforcement power in the U.S., rarely sue to stop mergers. Of the 1,326 transactions reviewed in the year ended Sept. 30, 2013, less than 1 percent went to court without a settlement, according to the most recent  . The FTC last sued to block a merger in December when it   Verisk Analytics Inc.\u2019s proposed $650 million acquisition of EagleView Technology Corp., according to the agency. Verisk then abandoned the deal, which would have created a virtual monopoly in the market for rooftop aerial measurement products used by insurers to assess property claims, the commission said. The agency challenged bigger mergers in 2013 when it sued to stop Pinnacle Entertainment Inc.\u2019s $2.8 billion   for Ameristar Casinos Inc. and glass-container manufacturer Ardagh Group SA\u2019s $1.7 billion   of Saint-Gobain Containers Inc.

Getty, which doesn\u2019t publish its financials, told holders of its $2.46 billion of debt this week that it depleted a third of its cash during the last three months of 2014, leaving it with $27 million, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak about the private report. It had almost $41 million three months earlier. \u201cTheir free-cash flow is challenged or muted by the high debt service and therefore they have to be prudent in their investments,\u201d Carl Salas, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t have as much capacity as Moody\u2019s would like to see for them to be more competitive\u201d against rivals such as Shutterstock Inc., he said. The announcement sent prices of the company\u2019s debt tumbling. Its term loan, due in October 2019, dropped 4 cents to a record-low 86.8 cents on the dollar, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. Getty\u2019s $550 million of unsecured 7 percent notes maturing in October 2020 have fallen 6.25 cents to 63.25 in the past two days and traded at a record-low 57.75 cents Tuesday, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\u2019s Trace price-reporting system. Sarah Lochting, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Getty Images, declined to comment about the company\u2019s performance, as did Randy Whitestone, a spokesman for Washington-based Carlyle. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, known as Ebitda, dropped 7 percent from a year earlier to $68.7 million, according to the people with knowledge of the Feb. 23  . Executives of the company also discussed the earnings on Tuesday with investors at an invitation-only   in Miami hosted by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The weak performance is squeezing Getty\u2019s access to credit because of terms of its $1.9 billion loan that limit borrowing when debt is more than six times its Ebitda. That ratio was already eight times as of Sept. 30, according to a Dec. 16 Moody\u2019s report. The company can\u2019t draw more than $30 million on its $150 million revolving credit line due October 2017 because doing so would run over the leverage test, Moody\u2019s said in the report. Tripping the covenant would trigger a breach of its debt terms and risk a technical default. Getty Images took on almost $2.6 billion in debt to finance Carlyle\u2019s $3.3 billion purchase of the business from Hellman & Friedman LLC in October 2012. Carlyle\u2019s Eliot Merrill, a managing director, said when his firm announced the purchase that it would \u201chelp take Getty Images to the next stage of product innovation and global growth.\u201d The company is a successor to Getty Communications Plc, which was controlled by the Getty family that made a fortune in the energy industry. It acquired PhotoDisc Inc. for $160 million in 1998 and changed its name. Hellman & Friedman bought the company for $2.1 billion a decade later. Getty Images\u2019s most challenging segment is its midstock business, which sells photographs to websites and small businesses, because of competition from companies including Shutterstock and Adobe System Inc.\u2019s Fotolia LLC, Salas said. Profit from that business fell 17 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the similar period last year, the people with knowledge of the financial results said. Getty Images told its investors that it used up $2.3 million of free cash in the quarter, said the people. Free cash is money available to be reinvested in the business or for shareholder rewards such as dividends and stock buybacks.","timestamp":1424886320.0,"participant_ids":["GYI:US","CG:US","MCO:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-25\/carlyle-s-getty-images-said-to-run-tight-on-cash-as-profit-drops","subject":"Getty Images Is Running Tight on Cash"},{"body":" The two oil basins off Rio de Janeiro\u2019s coast offer a glimpse into the tough choices Petroleo Brasileiro SA is making as it slashes $77 billion in investments. The Campos Basin along Rio\u2019s north shoreline produces more oil than any other region in Brazil, but output is sliding fast as fields age. The Santos Basin to the south holds Brazil\u2019s biggest-ever crude finds, but the massive deposits up to four miles deep are costly to tap. They each need billions of dollars in investments. Petrobras doesn\u2019t have the cash for both. The dilemma highlights how far Brazil\u2019s state-run oil giant has fallen since its 2010 heyday, when it raised $70 billion in what was then the world\u2019s biggest-ever share sale to fund projects from Africa to the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, a sweeping corruption scandal and tumbling oil prices have forced it to scale back operations. It\u2019s now trying to sell almost $60 billion of assets and cut more than a third of a five-year investment plan that was once the world\u2019s largest. \u201cThey definitely took their eye off the ball when everyone got overly excited about the pre-salt,\u201d as Santos\u2019s biggest fields are known, said Ruaraidh Montgomery, a Houston-based senior analyst for oil and gas corporate research at Wood Mackenzie. Petrobras\u2019s challenge is to balance Santos\u2019 \u201cheavy upfront investments\u201d while making sure \u201cthe good cash-flow-generating assets get the investments they need\u201d at Campos. The decision whether to focus on Santos or Campos isn\u2019t just about bolstering Petrobras\u2019s output or cash flow -- although the struggling company certainly needs the boost to help pay off the global oil industry\u2019s heaviest debt load. Santos, which holds as many as 100 billion barrels of recoverable oil according to some estimates, is also a cornerstone in Brazil\u2019s plan to become a major oil player on the world stage. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The company\u2019s stock fell 3.6 percent to 9.59 reais at 2:21 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading. Petrobras has been scaling back some Campos operations and shedding some older assets in recent years in favor of ramping up Santos output. And it shows: Petrobras\u2019s production at Campos fell to 1.4 million barrels a day in June, a 16-month low. That accounts for 65 percent of national production, down from 76 percent in 2012. While Petrobras is boosting oil extraction from its money-losing pre-salt fields, it\u2019s barely enough to make up for the drop at Campos. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to get net increases with this type of decline and the cap-ex cuts we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Bernardo Wjuniski, a Brazil oil industry research analyst at Medley Global Advisors. Petrobras is also embroiled in a corruption scandal that has spread to the nation\u2019s biggest builders and helped drive Brazil toward its worst recession in a quarter century. Further complicating matters is the plunge in oil prices, which could prompt Petrobras to cut investments even more, Deutsche Bank AG said Monday in a report. Oil has tumbled 52 percent in the past year, and Brent for September settlement closed at $50.21 a barrel Monday. The company needs Brent prices of at least $85 a barrel and parity with international fuel prices to fund investments and interest payments next year, Deutsche Bank said. Petrobras says Brent at $60 a barrel in 2015 and $70 in 2016 through 2019 are enough to finance its $130 billion, five-year investment plan. The oil-price plunge \u201cincreases all the pressure on their balance sheet,\u201d said Montgomery, the Wood Mackenzie analyst. \u201cThe pre-salt business, it\u2019s still not giving anything back.

Its billionaire Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg last week became the flag-bearer for a commodities revival after his move to cut zinc production by a third sparked one of the biggest metals rallies this year. \u201cThe difference between us and some of our competitors again is that we, in the current portfolio, have tier-one, big, high-margin businesses,\u201d Balhuizen said. \u201cObviously we are not going to shut in very cash rich operations.\u201d BHP, based in Melbourne, has dropped 11 percent in London trading this year. That compares with a 60 percent plunge for Glencore and a 4.5 percent retreat for the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 Index. BHP has closed some unprofitable production of steel-making coal in Australia in recent years,\u00a0Balhuizen said. Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the largest publicly traded copper supplier, said this week it may look to further reduce production amid falling prices. \u201cIf you are not making money, I believe you should take production out and reduce the supply,\u201d Glencore\u2019s Glasenberg   last week, prior to the company\u2019s announcement that it would cut zinc output.

In iron ore, trading more than two-thirds below its 2011 peak, more high-cost production will probably be cut as a glut of new supplies from Australia and Brazil continues to flood the market, Balhuizen said. \u201cThe cost curve will continue to flatten, will continue to come under pressure,\u201d he said.

The nation\u2019s largest grid, serving more than 61 million customers from Washington to Chicago, is revising its demand forecasts after recognizing that better lighting has undercut its projections. Swapping all of Thomas Edison\u2019s incandescent lightbulbs with lamps containing light emitting diodes, or LEDs, would save enough electricity to power 20 million American homes, according to the Energy Department. Americans\u2019 energy-conservation efforts, from switching bulbs to upgrading washing machines and air conditioners, have done more to reduce carbon emissions than the increased use of solar, wind and natural gas, according to consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Efficiency can help meet half of the emissions cuts sought under President Barack Obama\u2019s  , the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a total bulb revolution,\u201d Prajit Ghosh, director of power and renewables research at Wood Mackenzie in Houston, said Aug. 10 by phone. \u201cThe decline in load growth from both macroeconomic factors and energy-efficiency gains is by far the biggest reason carbon emissions fell. At least for the last five years, a majority of these savings came from lighting.\u201d A switch from the incandescent lamps, which were introduced in the 19th century, was prompted by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 that required lighting to become 25 percent to 30 percent more efficient by 2014 from 2008 levels. Lighting accounts for about 5 percent of a home\u2019s energy budget and switching to more efficient bulbs is one of the fastest ways to cut those costs, according to the Energy Department. LEDs use 75 to 80 percent less   than incandescents and last 25 times longer. LEDs will account for 83 percent of the lighting market share by 2020 and almost all of it 10 years later, the Energy Department says. The cost of the bulbs has fallen by more than 85 percent in six years, according to ACEEE, a Washington-based non-profit that promotes conservation. Bulbs are now available for less than $5. Use of the new bulbs is catching on. In February, the Super Bowl became the first National Football League championship played under LEDs. Ikea Group, the worldwide furniture retailer, said Aug. 10 that it will carry only LEDs starting next month and that they would be sold at the   on the market. PJM Interconnection LLC, which manages the largest U.S. grid, will for the first time include the effect of more efficient light bulbs and appliances in its long-term demand outlook, Tom Falin, manager of resource adequacy planning, said at the grid operator\u2019s headquarter in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The forecast for peak demand, a reflection of supplies needed on the hottest day of the year, will decline in 2016 from this year\u2019s level using a  , he said. Forecasts will be cut by about 4 percent each year through 2031 in the 15-year outlook. \u201cWithin the last three or four years, our performance model has not been performing as well as it had been,\u201d Falin said. Electricity demand no longer has the same responsiveness to economic growth that it had, he said. PJM isn\u2019t alone in recognizing the new efficiency. The Texas grid operator revised demand forecasts as growth lagged behind the economic rebound, easing concern about blackouts in the country\u2019s biggest energy-consuming state.  Duke Energy Corp. and American Electric Power Co. say energy efficiency helped them reduce carbon emissions. Exelon Corp. said higher demand from the improving economy in Chicago, Baltimore and Washington is being partially offset as consumers become more efficient. DTE Energy Inc. sees flat growth over the next few years compared with earlier projections of a 0.5 percent increase. U.S.   reached a record 10.66 billion kilowatt-hours a day in 2007, a level not matched eight years later, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Carbon dioxide  from electricity producers declined by 15 percent to 2.17 billion metric tons in 2013 from 2005, the agency said. Lower demand forecasts mean providers need less power generating capacity and that can result in lower costs for consumers. \u201cPower demand growth that was expected to be reached in 2017 won\u2018t be achieved before 2030,\u2019\u2019 said Ghosh of Wood Mackenzie.","timestamp":1439496060.0,"participant_ids":["DUK:US","DUK:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-13\/the-lowly-lightbulb-outshines-solar-and-wind-on-u-s-power-grids","subject":"The Lowly Lightbulb Outshines Solar and Wind on U.S. Power Grids"},{"body":"Walmart has accused labor activists of defying an administrative\u00a0judge\u2019s order by sharing private documents with  , which used them in a   about how the company combats protests.

Restaurants and other customers have many choices among food distributors that restrain prices and the merger will increase competition in those markets, Rich Parker, a lawyer for Sysco, said Friday on a conference call with analysts. \u201cThe commission simply got it wrong,\u201d he said about the FTC. \u201cThis transaction is procompetitive.

The case will probably go to trial before a federal judge in Washington within 60 to 90 days, Parker said. Sysco and US Foods are the biggest so-called broadline foodservice distributors in the U.S. and the only ones with distribution centers across the country that can provide nationwide service, the FTC said. The merged company would control 75 percent of the national market, according to the agency. Parker disputed the commission\u2019s view that there is a national market for food distribution, saying the business is based on local markets, where competition is fierce. \u201cThere is no national market. It is pure mythology,\u201d he said. Sysco, based in Houston, rose 2.9 percent to $39.66 in New York. The FTC declined to comment about the conference call. Sysco tried to resolve the FTC\u2019s concerns by agreeing to sell 11 US Foods facilities with $4.6 billion in sales to Performance Food Group.

Parker said negotiations with the FTC have come to a \u201cloggerhead\u201d and that there are no settlement talks taking place with the agency.

Law Firm Contributions to Legal Aid Groups Are Relatively Low Is there a mismatch between the biggest law firms and their charitable giving to legal organizations that help the poor and underserved? A new American Lawyer report says that although the \u201ccollective revenue of these firms passed the $100 billion mark\u201d and there have been records set for revenue and profit at some of the biggest 200 firms, \u201cit appears that the most generous firms contribute little more than one-tenth of 1 percent of their gross revenue to groups that provide basic legal services for the poor, and many fall far below that amount.\u201d There\u2019s an important caveat, however. The statistic doesn\u2019t include donations that individual lawyers make because those aren\u2019t feasible to track. Many firms have established foundations for charitable giving. It seems that these firms, according to the American Lawyer, donate to causes other than legal aid groups, including charities supported by clients and many law schools. The American Lawyer cited an American Bar Association report which said that contributions by individual lawyers and law firms of all sizes amounted to $95.8 million, or 7 percent of legal aid funding in 2013, the last year for which there are ABA statistics.

The debate holds big financial consequences for companies including start-ups like Uber Technologies Inc., the San Francisco-based developer of ride-sharing software for drivers and passengers, as well as traditional businesses that perform construction, trucking and cleaning services. Companies using contractors don\u2019t have to pay a minimum wage, reimburse expenses or contribute to Social Security. Employees, but not contractors, can form labor unions. \u201cThis is a stealth issue; technical on the surface, but with tremendous underlying importance,\u201d said Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. \u201cThis is about classifying workers as full participants in the workforce and capable of being unionized.\u201d Last week, California\u2019s labor commissioner   an Uber driver was an employee, ordering the company to reimburse her expenses. Federal labor attorneys in Boston and Chicago are reviewing a complaint brought by a driver for Uber competitor Lyft Inc. who is trying to organize a union. The U.S. Labor Department is preparing new guidance on the subject, and is spending more time investigating companies that may be misclassifying workers to avoid having to pay minimum wage or meet federal workplace standards. The developing \u201con demand\u201d economy, which links workers - - drivers and cleaners, for example -- directly with customers, is creating new challenges for regulators. But classification issues are broader and, analysts say, increasing as the nature of work shifts away from permanent jobs that last a career. \u201cIt\u2019s going to impact not just independent contractors and sharing economy stuff, but a whole range of employment relationships,\u201d said Alexander Passantino, a partner at Seyfarth Shaw in Washington. \u201cThere are some businesses whose whole business model may be called into question.\u201d If upheld in court, the California labor commission ruling against Uber could lead more drivers to seek reimbursement for gasoline and other expenses, a direct challenge to its business model. Uber spokeswoman Jessica Santillo said the decision contradicts rulings in five other states that concluded that drivers were independent contractors. ``The majority of them can and do choose to earn their living from multiple sources, including other ride sharing companies,''Santillo said in an e-mail. In addition, Uber and Lyft face federal lawsuits that contend their drivers should have legal protections afforded employees. The ranks of contingent workers, including the self-employed, temporary hires and independent contractors, swelled to 40 percent of the workforce in 2010, from 31 percent in 2005, the Government Accountability Office, Congress\u2019s investigative arm, said in an April report. Most of the growth came in part-time workers, possibly due to the recession, the report said. The National Employment Law Project, a New York-based group that advocates for workers, said in a report last year that the 2.8 million temporary workers in the U.S. was a record. David Weil, who heads the U.S. Labor Department\u2019s wage and hour division, said he\u2019s concerned that the shift is costing workers wages and workplace protections provided to employees. The agency has stepped up investigations into back pay violations by more than 20 percent since 2009, and has signed cooperation agreements with 21 states as part of a campaign against misclassification. Weil said he plans to issue a new \u201cadministrative interpretation\u201d to provide further guidance to help companies judge who\u2019s an independent contractor and who\u2019s an employee. \u201cEmployment relationships in more and more industries have been broken apart,\u201d said Weil, who as an economics professor at Boston University wrote an influential book on the subject called the \u201cFissured Workplace.\u201d In a fissured workplace, workers at a hotel may not be directly employed by the brand name on the door but a subcontractor hired by a staffing agency. Companies can reduce costs as much as 30 percent by using contractors instead of employees, Weil said. \u201cAs each business takes its cut, things like pensions and other benefits fall out,\u201d said Rebecca Smith, deputy director of the employment law project. The employer-versus-independent contractor question also is arising in labor disputes. Attorneys with the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s regional offices in Chicago and Boston are looking into a complaint by a driver at Lyft who is trying to organize a union at the company. As a first step, board investigators will have to determine if the driver is an employee and therefore eligible to organize under labor law. Shannon Liss-Riordan, an partner at Lichten & Liss-Riordan, P.C. in Boston, is representing the Lyft worker. She also represents Uber drivers in California. Liss-Riordan didn\u2019t return a call for comment. \u201cLyft drivers are not employees,\u201d said Chelsea Wilson, a Lyft spokeswoman, in an e-mailed statement. \u201cThey use Lyft, and other on-demand services, as a flexible and reliable way to make ends meet without having to be stuck in a schedule that doesn\u2019t work for them. We hear from drivers that this flexibility is one of the main reasons they choose Lyft.\u201d The NLRB also is reconsidering its definition of an employer. The five-member panel, which investigates worker claims and adjudicates labor disputes, soon may rule on a proposal from its general counsel to rewrite its \u201cjoint employer\u201d standard, which could change the responsibility some businesses have over the working conditions and benefits of the contractors and temporary staff. Business group are challenging the shift, arguing a new classification would raise costs and slow expansion in a growing segment of the economy. \u201cUpending the current, well-established, joint employer standard would cause uncertainty and disruption for many small business owners, force some small businesses to close and deter aspiring entrepreneurs from opening businesses and creating new jobs,\u201d said Matthew Haller, a spokesman for the International Franchise Association, which opposes the proposed revision to the NLRB\u2019s joint employer standard. The issues over classification are \u201cmuch more visible, much more complicated and much more significant in many ways,\u201d due to the shifting nature of the workforce, Wilma Liebman, a former chairwoman of the National Labor Relations Board, said in an interview.","timestamp":1435125600.0,"participant_ids":["0084207D:US","0812823D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-24\/uber-case-spotlights-a-challenge-when-is-a-worker-an-employee-","subject":"Uber Case Spotlights a Challenge: When Is a Worker an Employee?"},{"body":" football players cannot form a union,\u00a0the National Labor Relations Board ruled, overturning a March 2014 decision and ending the players\u2019 bid to change the college sports landscape. In its unanimous decision, the labor board skirted the issue of whether the players are employees and left open the door to other college athletes winning the right to unionize. The board cited the unique nature of college sports in saying it would foster instability to permit Northwestern football players to form a union while players elsewhere in the National Collegiate Athletic Association are not. \"Our decision is primarily premised on a finding that because of the nature of sports leagues...it would not promote stability in labor relations to assert jurisdiction in this case,\" the decision said. This was the first case before the NLRB involving college athletes of any kind, and it\u2019s the first time the board has been asked to certify a single-team unit in any sport. Of the 125 football programs in\u00a0the NCAA\u2019s Football Bowl Subdivision, the top echelon, just 17 are private schools and Northwestern is the only one in the Big Ten Conference. The NLRB only has jurisdiction over private schools, while state labor boards oversee public institutions. Surprised by Ruling The ruling was surprising, according to Brian Paul, a labor attorney at Michael Best & Friedrich LLP in Chicago. \u201cWhat the NLRB has done is invite the group to come back if the landscape changes enough to warrant unionization,\u201d Paul said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe single school doesn\u2019t have enough influence on how the FBS as a whole is operated.\u201d Northwestern is pleased by the decision and considers its athletes to be students first and foremost, Vice President for University Relations Alan K. Cubbage said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cNorthwestern\u2019s position remains that participation in athletics is part of the overall educational experience for our student-athletes, not a separate activity,\u201d he said. Former UCLA football player Ramogi Huma, founder of College Athletes Players Association, which was trying to organize the Northwestern players, declined to comment before reading the ruling. Lamar Alexander, the Republican senator from Tennessee who is chairman of the Senate labor committee, said in a statement that preventing the union effort was the right thing for student athletes but that the board had done them \u201cno favor by leaving the question open for the future.\u201d \u201cI do not believe that Congress, when it wrote the National Labor Relations Act, intended that students \u2013 whether they be athletes or graduate assistants - be considered employees of their university,\u201d Alexander said. The unionization effort, along with recent lawsuits seeking to increase college players\u2019 rights, had the potential to upend the business of college sports. Schools in college football\u2019s top division turned a $1.4 billion profit on $3.4 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ended June 2014, according to data schools submit to the U.S. Department of Education. The NLRB\u2019s decision leaves no recourse for Northwestern players to appeal. \u201cThat is it,\u201d Doug Allen, a labor-relations professor at Penn State University\u00a0who was assistant executive director of the NFL Players Association from 1982-2007, said about such an outcome prior to the NLRB review. \u201cThat\u2019s a final and binding result.\u201d There were 76 scholarship players at the Evanston, Illinois, school who were eligible -- though not compelled -- to vote in April 2014 over whether to form a union. They did vote, needing a simple majority for approval, though those ballots now will be destroyed without being counted. A month earlier, an NLRB regional director upheld the players\u2019 right to vote, though the Washington-based board granted the school\u2019s request to review the initial ruling and said players\u2019 ballots would be impounded until it decided. Of the 111 student-athletes who will be on the Wildcats\u2019 roster this fall, from 44 to 47 of them will have voted in the April 2014 NLRB election, estimated Northwestern spokesman Paul Kennedy. Players\u2019 Issues The group trying to organize the players was seeking guaranteed coverage of sports-related medical expenses for current and former athletes, sponsorship compensation, an increase in scholarship value and a trust fund to help former players finish their degrees. Many of those issues have been addressed by the sport\u2019s overseers over the ensuing months, and college athletics have changed significantly. In August 2014, a federal court ruled that student athletes should be allowed to seek a share of $800 million in annual broadcast revenue. The NCAA has appealed the ruling on the lawsuit filed in 2009 by ex-college basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon. That same month the NCAA altered its governance, granting partial autonomy to the five richest conferences. In January, those conferences voted to give their schools the option of offering scholarships that meet the cost of attendance, estimated to provide an additional $3,000 annually to student athletes. With 36,000 people in that group, it would be a commitment of around $108 million. Both the Big Ten Conference, of which Northwestern is a member, and Pac-12 Conference now guarantee four-year scholarships. Northwestern has done so since 2011. Medical Coverage The Pac-12 also decided in October that athletes injured during college competition would have medical coverage for up to four years after graduating. \u201cA lot of these things that we\u2019ve been fighting for for decades, they finally came about because college players decided to stand up for what they believe in,\u201d former Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter, the face of the unionization push, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the outcome that we wanted but the big thing is that they didn\u2019t rule against us; they basically decided not to rule.\u201d Colter said on a media conference call in January 2014 that the NCAA system \u201cresembles a dictatorship\u201d that left players without any way to input or negotiate their views. Colter wasn\u2019t picked in the 2014 NFL draft, though he spent the following season on the Minnesota Vikings practice squad. He was cut from the team in May and said he\u2019s still hoping to be picked up by an NFL franchise.","timestamp":1439816254.0,"participant_ids":["1003059D:US","6100Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-17\/northwestern-football-players-cannot-form-a-union-nlrb-rules","subject":"Northwestern Football Players Cannot Form Union, NLRB Rules"},{"body":"U.S. aviation regulators plan to require all newly built helicopters to have crash-resistant fuel tanks to cut the risks of leaks and deadly fires after accidents as part of the broadest effort in decades to improve\u00a0rotor-aircraft safety. The Federal Aviation Administration asked an advisory committee to draft new regulations requiring the technology, according to a\u00a0Sept. 28 letter sent to the National Transportation Safety Board and posted on the agency\u2019s website. That marks a significant shift on a controversial safety issue that has been linked to more than 200 civilian deaths since 1994. The U.S. Army has cut casualties from fires after helicopter crashes with the use of bladder-like fuel tank linings developed during the Vietnam War, but some operators and manufacturers argued that such technology was too expensive and would hamper operations. \u201cIt is going to be extremely difficult and expensive to figure out how to incorporate it into an existing design,\u201d\u00a0Walter Desrosier, the vice president for engineering and maintenance at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association trade group, said in an interview. The FAA asked the industry panel,\u00a0called the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee, to explore ways to better protect helicopter occupants from crashes, according to an Oct. 8 letter. It was spurred by a recent study showing better protections would save lives, according to the FAA letter. The agency also is asking for a review of other safety measures, including requiring seats that don\u2019t break loose in accidents and structural changes to prevent occupants from being crushed. The action was spurred by emerging data on helicopter crashes and how to prevent them in the future, FAA\u00a0Administrator Michael Huerta said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cWhat we want to do is take advantage of what more do we know,\u201d Huerta said. In the 1980s and 1990s, the FAA adopted helicopter safety standards for new designs. Since then, however, only 16 percent or fewer helicopters sold have the protections because manufacturers mainly produce aircraft based on older designs. \u201cThis approach has resulted in a very low incorporation rate of occupant protection features into the rotorcraft fleet, and fatal accidents remain unacceptably high,\u201d the FAA said. While the helicopter industry supports reviewing whether new standards make sense, it hasn\u2019t endorsed any specific measures, Desrosier said. Requiring fuel-tank upgrades may cost manufacturers millions of dollars, an expense that wouldn\u2019t justify whatever benefit it creates, he said. One option may be to create a streamlined protection system that would be cheaper to install on existing models, he said. GAMA represents helicopter makers including United Technologies Corp.\u2019s Sikorsky Aircraft division, Airbus Group SE\u2019s Airbus Helicopters Inc. and Textron Inc.\u2019s Bell Helicopter. GAMA members delivered 971 new helicopters last year, according to the group\u2019s annual statistical report. The Helicopter Association International, a trade group representing fleet operators, supports the FAA\u2019s effort though it hasn\u2019t endorsed changes to fuel tanks or other specific measures, said Chris Dancy, a spokesman.\u00a0The group will work on the advisory committee, he said. Safer fuel tanks were developed by the military in the 1960s in response to the high number of casualties in Vietnam after helicopters caught fire in the aftermath of crashes that were otherwise survivable. Companies including   of Tempe, Arizona, have built such tanks for military aircraft and ground vehicles, as well as race cars, according to company founder S. Harry Robertson. Their system, known as \u201cRobbie Tanks,\u201d work by preventing leaks even after being pierced by bullets or fractured by an impact. The safety board on July 23 urged the FAA to impose stricter standards. The FAA agrees with the NTSB on the need to upgrade fuel tanks and has started the rulemaking process, the FAA\u2019s Huerta wrote in the September letter. The NTSB\u2019s July recommendation was prompted by an Oct. 4, 2014, helicopter accident in Wichita Falls, Texas. Surveillance video that captured the crash showed a flight nurse and paramedic survived the impact, but died when fuel spilled and ignited, according to the NTSB. From 1994 to 2013, there were 135 helicopter accidents in which fire broke out after impact, resulting in 221 deaths and 37 serious injuries, according to NTSB. Of those crashes, only three had crash-resistant fuel systems. After the U.S. Army began requiring fuel protections in the 1960s, it saw a 75 percent decrease in injuries and zero fatalities attributed to post-crash fires, according to the NTSB letter. The letter didn\u2019t specify the years when the decrease took place or how many deaths there were prior to the requirement taking effect. The FAA didn\u2019t set a deadline for when it would complete its new regulations. It must first draft the rule and then allow the public and industry to comment.","timestamp":1445407200.0,"participant_ids":["SFTCHZ:KS","0212932D:US","0289996Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-21\/vietnam-era-fuel-tank-safety-for-helicopters-sought-by-u-s-faa","subject":"The FAA Wants New Helicopters to Have Crash-Resistant Fuel Tanks"},{"body":"Doosan Corp.\u2019s U.S. fuel cell unit agreed to supply 70 power plants to South Korea\u2019s largest utility.

Like the government-backed JPX-Nikkei Index 400, the iStoxx MUTB Japan Quality 150 Index started by Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp. and Stoxx Ltd. picks companies with high return on equity. But the new gauge doesn\u2019t care about changing their behavior or choosing the biggest firms, its planners say, as its sole focus is finding winning shares. While the index only began trading on Aug. 4, it beats the JPX-Nikkei 400 in back tests. The index is further proof Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s push to make companies more capital efficient is finding friends in the nation\u2019s markets. It also highlights a limitation of the JPX-Nikkei 400, whose success in getting firms to stop hoarding cash hasn\u2019t been matched by the returns it gives investors. \u201cThe JPX-Nikkei 400 is about pressing companies to improve their governance,\u201d said Yoshiyuki Masuda, an executive at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking who helped design the gauge. \u201cOur goal is totally different.\u201d While the iStoxx MUTB Japan Quality 150 picks firms with high ROE, it also looks at a company\u2019s cash flow and how consistently it generates profit over five years. Companies with less debt have a greater chance of being chosen. ROE accounts for 40 percent of the selection criteria, with the other three set at 20 percent each. \u201cThe ability to generate cash flow is the ability to be profitable,\u201d said Roy Wong, regional director for Stoxx in Tokyo. \u201cWe found the five-year period to be a good indicator. It\u2019s a comfortable time period to catch enough data to evaluate the company.\u201d The JPX-Nikkei 400 selects constituents based on three-year average ROE and cumulative operating profit, each accounting for 40 percent of the total. Market value makes up the remaining 20 percent. Investors have criticized the gauge for adding large companies even if their ROE is low, and for recommending overpriced stocks at the top of their cycles. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Japan\u2019s biggest drugmaker by market value, has a place on the JPX-Nikkei 400 despite ROE of minus 6.8 percent. Gamemaker Sega Sammy Holdings Inc. remains on the gauge even with ROE of minus 7.7 percent. \u201cWe don\u2019t choose stocks directly based on size,\u201d said Masuda of the new gauge. \u201cBut we do narrow them down to the somewhat large firms of the Stoxx 600 Index.\u201d The Mitsubishi UFJ-Stoxx gauge and to some degree the JPX-Nikkei 400 reflect a   in passive investing that says indexes can be designed with more in mind than simply replicating a market\u2019s return. Dubbed smart beta or fundamental indexing in some quarters, proponents attempt to group stocks that, by virtue of characteristics like higher earnings growth or dividends, they hope will beat returns of past indexes. The iStoxx MUTB Japan Quality 150 would have risen 38 percent when calculated retroactively from the start of 2014, when the JPX-Nikkei 400 began trading, through Tuesday\u2019s close. The shame gauge climbed 28 percent in that period, as did the broader Topix index. The Mitsubishi UFJ-Stoxx gauge lost 2 percent on Wednesday, while the JPX-Nikkei 400 slid 1.5 percent and the Topix dropped 1.4 percent. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of having so many different types of ROE indexes,\u201d said Tomomi Yamashita, a fund manager in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co. \u201cIndexes end up all moving in similar ways.\u201d The JPX-Nikkei 400 drew criticism after its second annual reshuffle this month. The measure didn\u2019t pick Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility behind the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, even as brokerages   it was set to make the cut. The reasons for excluding Tepco are \u201cdubious,\u201d SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. Chief Quants Analyst Keiichi Ito wrote in a note on Aug. 7, calling on the bourse to clarify its selection decisions. Because the new index doesn\u2019t aim to   Japan\u2019s best companies, it can follow its quantitative criteria no matter what companies make the cut. \u201cOther than what\u2019s available in our rulebook, we don\u2019t have any hidden rules,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThe market likes to have clarity on what index they\u2019re getting into, and to share that information is a given.\u201d The JPX-Nikkei 400 is designed for both companies and investors, according to Kazunari Tomita, head of information services at the Tokyo exchange. We aim to \u201cencourage company management to think about capital efficiency,\u201d he said. \u201cTo do that we need investors to use it. From the beginning, we tried to create an index investors can\u2019t find anywhere else.\u201d The JPX-Nikkei 400 has made some Japanese executives change their strategies. Amada Holdings Co. is one example. The machinery maker pledged last year to pay half its profit in dividends and spend the other half on buybacks for three years, in a bid to be selected. Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co., which manages about 12 trillion yen ($96 billion), will start an exchange-traded fund tracking the Mitsubishi UFJ-Stoxx measure this year, Masuda said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying our index is better than the JPX-Nikkei 400,\u201d Masuda said. \u201cIt just has a different role.\u201d","timestamp":1439932846.0,"participant_ids":["156250Z:SW","8306:JP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-19\/japan-shame-gauge-gets-rival-with-no-mission-to-make-ceos-change","subject":"Japan Shame Gauge Gets Rival With No Mission to Change CEOs"},{"body":" While Japan\u2019s   nuclear power restart had to endure protests and even a volcano alert, the bond market is already pricing in more reactors resuming operations. The cost to insure Kyushu Electric Power Co. debt against nonpayment fell to 39 basis points last week, the lowest since right after the March 2011 Fukushima meltdown, as its Sendai power station came back online. That for Kansai Electric Power Co. also slid to a four-year low. Twelve reactors will restart by March 31, 2017, out of Japan\u2019s operable fleet of 43, the average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows. Adding back nuclear energy should improve the finances of utilities since it has the lowest electricity generation cost of any power source, according to government data. Japan raised an eruption   for a volcano on the southern island of Kyushu to the second-highest level on Aug. 15, four days after restarting the Sendai reactor 50 kilometers (31 miles) away. \u201cReactor restarts will cut costs, such as those from purchasing liquid-natural gas, and increase profits,\u201d said Mana Nakazora, the chief credit analyst in Tokyo at BNP Paribas SA. \u201cBecause of that, it will also tighten spreads.\u201d The bond risk of Kansai and Kyushu Electric has fallen below a gauge for Japanese companies. The Markit iTraxx Japan CDS index has dropped six basis points in the past year to 59, compared with a tumble of 48 in Kansai\u2019s risk and a decrease of 26 for Kyushu, according to CMA data. With the reactor online, Kyushu Electric\u2019s profits are expected to increase by 7.5 billion yen ($61 million) a month, and that figure will double when it restarts a second reactor around the middle of October, according to Tokyo-based Kenji Kawabata, the company\u2019s deputy regional director. The company, based in Fukuoka in southern Japan, reported a net income of 18.8 billion yen for the three months ended June 30, compared with a 40.6 billion yen loss a year earlier. Kyushu Electric\u2019s probability of debt non-payment within one year has dropped to 0.29 percent from 0.9 percent 12 months earlier, according to the Bloomberg default-risk model, which considers factors such as share prices and debt levels. The gauge suggests the utility\u2019s credit rating has risen to the second-lowest investment grade from a high-yield score. Japan\u2019s Nuclear Regulation Authority has said that  , including two of Kyushu Electric at Sendai, meet its safety requirements. So far, 25 of Japan\u2019s fleet of 43 reactors have applied to resume operations. Now that Sendai\u2019s back online, the pace at which the NRA approves reactors will be faster, according to Polina Diyachkina, an analyst who covers Japan\u2019s power utilities at Macquarie Group Ltd. \u201cThe framework for approval of new safety standard has been developed, the NRA knows which questions to ask and companies know how to answer them,\u201d she said by e-mail. Osaka-based Kansai Electric\u2019s two reactors at the Takahama station, about 60 kilometers north of Kyoto, have received NRA approval, but court challenges have prevented them from restarting. Once Kyushu Electric turns its second reactor at Sendai back on in October, the NRA will accelerate its review process for Kansai Electric\u2019s Ohi units 3 and 4, Hidetoshi Shioda, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., wrote in a July 30 note. Legal issues at Takahama will also be resolved and its two reactors will be back online by the end of next year, he said. In a Kyodo News poll this month, 55 percent of Japanese opposed restarting atomic plants while 37 percent were in favor. In the long term, nuclear power output will probably taper. London-based Bloomberg New Energy Finance expects 15 gigawatts worth of nuclear power to be operating by 2030. This is below the government\u2019s goal of more than 37 gigawatts. Some reactors will retire in the mid-2020\u2019s \u201cbecause they will be hitting their lifetime limit\u201d of 40 years without special permission, said Ali Izadi-Najafabadi, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cOur assumption is that only the larger reactors worth upgrading will get a 20-year extension.\u201d","timestamp":1439985660.0,"participant_ids":["9501:JP","3470094Z:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-19\/japan-atomic-restart-endures-protest-volcano-as-bond-risk-drops","subject":"Japan Atomic Restart Endures Protest, Volcano as Bond Risk Drops"},{"body":"The United Auto Workers is expected to take contract talks to the brink of a strike deadline Sunday night with General Motors Co. and ultimately reach a deal that is similar, though somewhat richer, than the four-year pact it recently negotiated with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. \u201cThere\u2019s always the possibility of strike, it\u2019s never an idle threat,\u201d said\u00a0Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cBut I think they will find a way. The pressure of a deadline will force both sides to confront the fact that they have to compromise.\u201d The union\u00a0  Saturday it informed GM\u00a0that it will terminate its contract with the carmaker at 11:59 p.m. Sunday, effectively setting a strike deadline. The Detroit-based company said it was working with the UAW \u201cto address the issues and remain committed to obtaining an agreement that is good for employees and the business.\u201d The move follows the UAW\u2019s deal reached\u00a0Oct. 22 with Fiat Chrysler that provided\u00a0raises across the board, including increases for so-called Tier 2 employees that would eventually boost their maximum wage from about $19 an hour to the more than $29 rate of senior workers.\u00a0The Fiat Chrysler pact will cost the company almost $2 billion over four years, people familiar with the matter have said. UAW President Dennis Williams has sought richer agreements with GM and Ford Motor Co., which are each more profitable than FCA. \u201cGiven that the heavy lifting has already been done at Chrysler and the fact that GM just announced record North American profits, both sides have a reason to make this work,\u201d Shaiken said. \u201cGM is in far stronger economic shape than Chrysler, and the union will want to see more in what they get from them.\u201d The UAW last struck GM in 2007 for two days before reaching agreement on a four-year contract that included a lower wage for new hires, the Tier 2 workers, to help the automaker through an economic downturn. GM and Chrysler ultimately went through government-sponsored bankruptcies in 2009. \u201cThere is a profound difference between now and 2007 because GM and the UAW have built a solid working relationship,\u201d Shaiken said. \u201cThe experience of the bankruptcy was searing for both sides.\u201d The UAW is reaching agreements that add substantially to the automakers\u2019 costs\u00a0for the first time in a decade. The UAW may win greater profit-sharing and bonuses and more jobs from GM and Ford. GM and Ford may also have to provide more for senior workers, who account for about 80 percent of union members at GM and and 72 percent at Ford. The UAW will need to make them happy to get any deal ratified. GM\u2019s workforce is seeking to phase out the two-tier pay system of previous contracts, increase job security and get more money, said Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan. GM has been building goodwill with its workers in hopes of avoiding a contract rejection like Fiat Chrysler\u2019s, he said. \u201cThe lights will be on late,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cNeither side wants a strike.\u201d The Fiat Chrysler contract was   after UAW members there rejected an initial agreement and sent their leaders back to the bargaining table, where they secured larger signing bonuses and bigger raises for the second-tier workers. About 200 negotiators, divided into 13 subcommittees focusing on issues including health care, safety and training programs, are meeting in Detroit\u2019s UAW-GM Center for Human Resources, a GM spokeswoman said. Talks are expected to go late into the night and may run up against tonight\u2019s deadline. If the two sides fail to reach an agreement before the end of the weekend, they may agree to extend the deadline to continue talks. Should GM and the union fail to reach an agreement, the UAW might call a strike targeting a plant that makes key parts, such as engine or transmission components, to choke off production companywide, said Bloomberg Intelligence automotive analyst Kevin Tynan. The union\u2019s strategy would be to minimize the number of workers it has to pay from its strike fund, he said. GM said Thursday that it will add 1,200 jobs at a car factory in Detroit before announcing Friday that it plans to lay off about 500 hourly employees at its small-car plant north of the city.","timestamp":1445789714.0,"participant_ids":["GM:US","F:IM"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-25\/gm-faces-sunday-midnight-strike-deadline-in-uaw-contract-talks","subject":"GM Faces Sunday Night Strike Deadline in UAW Contract Talks"},{"body":" As U.S. regulators study how to govern commercial drones, corporate America is plunging ahead on using unmanned aircraft in a bid to speed the process and win concessions on proposed restrictions. Large companies including American International Group Inc., Chevron Corp. and BNSF Railway Co. are planning flight trials to inspect storm damage, pipelines and railroad tracks. Union Pacific Corp. will employ its 7-pound drones to monitor derailments of hazardous materials. The tests come amid complaints from critics led by Amazon.com Inc. that the Federal Aviation Administration is impeding technology that is being deployed rapidly abroad and could reshape everything from industrial inspections to farmland management. While Amazon works on futuristic cargo carriers, other companies are seeking less-restrictive rules as they begin to get unmanned aerial vehicles into U.S. skies. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us are out to do this because it\u2019s a cool thing to do,\u201d Lynden Tennison, Union Pacific\u2019s chief information officer, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re out to do it because we believe it has business benefits.\u201d Drones\u2019 potential will be a centerpiece this week in Atlanta as manufacturers and users gather for the annual trade show for the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. The FAA will be urged to move quickly on permanent rules. The agency proposed regulations in February to lift the current ban on the commercial use of drones weighing less than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) while imposing restrictions. Final rules may be more than a year away as regulators assess about 4,500 public comments. Other regulations cover drones\u2019 recreational use. Safety advocates welcome the FAA\u2019s caution, but the planned restrictions remain onerous to drone makers and customers: no flying beyond line of sight, no nighttime flights, no operating near people -- and the list goes on. Last year, the FAA agreed to grant exemptions for companies wanting to test drones, and has issued   since September. About a dozen went to large companies. The agency created the exemption so commercial users could start flying even as it follows its usual rulemaking procedure, spokesman Les Dorr said. The FAA\u2019s main priority is to keep the flying public safe, he said. Chevron is proceeding with development of unmanned aircraft to check pipelines, according to Christian Sanz, chief executive officer of Skycatch, a drone and software maker working with the oil company. The catch: Chevron\u2019s operators would be miles from the drones, while the FAA requires them to be in sight. If the rule isn\u2019t relaxed by the time the UAVs are ready to fly, the tests will be done outside the U.S., Sanz said. \u201cYou have all these multibillion-dollar companies knocking on the door saying, \u2018We want to use this now and you need to make it easier,\u2019\u201d said Sanz. He predicts the FAA eventually will drop the line-of-sight requirement. Amazon, which is developing drones to deliver packages, has been especially critical of the FAA. A proposed agency rule would require drones to be under an operator\u2019s direct control, while Amazon\u2019s craft, flying at least 200 feet off the ground, would be guided by computers and sensors. In testimony to a U.S. Senate subcommittee in March, Paul Misener, Amazon\u2019s vice president for global public policy, criticized regulators for paying little heed to rules for such autonomous flight. \u201cThis low level of government attention and slow pace are inadequate, especially compared to the regulatory efforts in other countries,\u201d Misener said in a transcript of his testimony. Amazon also complained it took six months to receive an exemption, compared with two months or less in other countries where it\u2019s experimenting with delivery drones. In an April 24 filing with the FAA, Amazon said its drones should be allowed to fly if they\u2019re not at risk of a collision or a crash. Most countries, including Canada, the U.K. and Japan, already have permanent laws in place to fly commercial drones. In Japan, farmers use unmanned aircraft to apply pesticides to their fields. The agency has been one of the biggest \u201croadblocks\u201d to the commercial drone industry\u2019s growth, said  , chief of sales and marketing for dronemaker 3D Robotics, which is supplying BNSF and AIG with their aircraft. The FAA pays too little notice to how drones flying for business could save lives by replacing piloted helicopters and planes, he said. \u201cEvery single year there are multiple deaths from people flying over power lines taking pictures,\u201d Guinn said. BNSF plans to use drones to supplement inspection of track and bridges, spokesman Michael Trevino said. Union Pacific next wants to use drones to check on railroad radio towers that stretch as high as 400 feet and now require inspectors to scale them, Tennison said. Drones would make the work faster and safer, he said. AIG already is making inspection flights with drones in New Zealand, said Eric Martinez, chief of claims and operations. With unmanned aircraft, the insurer will be able to survey natural-disaster damage with greater speed, detail and safety than relying on workers on ladders and mobile lifts. \u201cPreviously we either wouldn\u2019t have had access to this information, would have had to wait, or in some cases collect it with hands-on methods,\u201d Martinez said by e-mail. Pilots and small-plane makers say the FAA is right to move carefully. Adding commercial drones to U.S. airspace dwarfs the transition to jets from piston planes and the debut of helicopters, said  , a vice president with the General Aviation Manufacturers Association trade group. \u201cIndustry is going 1,000 miles per hour with all-new technologies, capabilities and products,\u201d Desrosier said. \u201cAnd the FAA and the government in terms of how it establishes new regulations and safety standards can only go 50 miles per hour.\u201d Drone mishaps have stoked critics\u2019 concerns. In January, a man in Washington lost control of a recreational drone that crash-landed on the White House lawn. Last year, a military drone weighing about 375 pounds slammed down near a Pennsylvania elementary school during an exercise and was struck by a vehicle. \u201cThere a sizable number of restrictions,\u201d Union Pacific\u2019s Tennison said. \u201cThe FAA has been listening and is recognizing this is an evolving area for them and that it will require change over time.\u201d","timestamp":1430728221.0,"participant_ids":["AMZN:US","AIG:US","UNP:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-04\/corporate-america-s-unleash-the-drones-plea-puts-the-heat-on-faa","subject":"Corporate America\u2019s Unleash-the-Drones Plea Puts the Heat on FAA"},{"body":"Chipotle is fresh -- and suddenly, that\u2019s a problem.

Unlike the big burger-and-fries chains that deal with a handful of beef and potato suppliers and distributors, Chipotle depends on a more complex supply chain for its 1,900 outlets that includes scores of small, independent farmers. That can lead to ingredient shortages and questions about food safety. When Chipotle can\u2019t deliver on its healthy and fresh promise, its greatest strength can turn into its biggest weakness. In the latest sign of trouble, Chipotle temporarily closed a restaurant in Boston on Monday after several Boston College students, including members of the men\u2019s basketball team, reported getting sick after eating there. In that case, health officials are leaning toward norovirus as the culprit, not E. coli, Chipotle said. \u201cIt strikes deeper at their brand because so much of their story is based on the quality of their ingredients,\u201d said Allen Adamson, a brand consultant and the former chairman of Landor North America. \u201cThis can clearly do long-term damage if they don\u2019t get it under control.\u201d The fallout from the E. coli outbreak has been swift. Sales tumbled 16 percent in November, prompting Chipotle to rescind its 2016 forecast and announce a $300 million stock buyback to shore up the company\u2019s sliding share price. Chipotle\u2019s shares are down 22 percent over the last four months, the worst performance among restaurant companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. The shares fell an additional 5.6 percent to as low as $521.01 on Tuesday after the latest reports about Boston College. Dealing with local farmers is not Chipotle\u2019s only supply chain challenge. It\u2019s also struggled at times to secure a reliable flow of the hormone and antibiotic-free chicken, beef and pork it uses to make burritos. The company has said that 95 percent of the pork raised in the U.S. does not meet its standards. Earlier this year, the company suspended a pork supplier after an audit determined that its pigs weren\u2019t kept in \u201cdeeply bedded barns\u201d and didn\u2019t have adequate access to the outdoors. Chipotle was forced to pull carnitas from about a third of its restaurants and it took the chain months to find additional pork suppliers. The gap in the menu dragged on sales and led to questions about the potential for the chain\u2019s food standards to restrain its growth.\u00a0 Now in the wake of the E. coli cases, Chipotle is tightening its supplier standards and re-evaluating its local produce program, which dates back to 2008. The pullback hits at the the heart of Chipotle\u2019s culture and marketing, which has touted its support of sustainable agriculture. \u201cYou can never eliminate all risk, regardless of the size of suppliers, but the program we have put in place since the incident began is designed to eliminate or mitigate risk to a level near zero,\u201d Chris Arnold, a spokesman for the Denver-based company, said in an e-mail. Nonetheless, Chipotle has made itself vulnerable with its reliance on small suppliers, according to David Acheson, a former Food and Drug Administration official who now runs a food-safety consulting business. \u201cI worry about the small, local supplier who doesn\u2019t have the resources to track the latest things to do on food safety,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cThey\u2019re small operators and you simply don\u2019t have the infrastructure and the capacity to keep up with this stuff.\u201d Even before the health scares, Chipotle had been struggling with slowing growth. The company has faced higher food costs associated with sourcing GMO- and hormone-free ingredients. It has also stepped up its marketing spend to tout those benefits. This isn\u2019t time first Chipotle has hit a bump in the road. The company posted a meager 2.2 percent gain at established restaurants in 2009, leading to questions that the burrito chain may have plateaued after double-digit growth in two of the previous three years. But that, it turned out, was a rare off year. Chipotle\u2019s sales surged 17 percent in 2014 and the company\u2019s shares still trade at about 32 times earnings, second only to Starbucks Corp. among restaurant companies in the S&P 500. That said, Chipotle may be facing a more serious challenge now. What initially appeared to be an E. coli outbreak limited to the Pacific Northwest, where Chipotle closed\u00a043 restaurants in Oregon and Washington, took on larger proportions when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were E. coli cases in additional states, including New York and California. It\u2019s been a rough few months for Chipotle. In July, a smaller E. coli outbreak occurred in Washington, sickening five people, though it was never reported by local authorities. Also over the summer, a norovirus outbreak at a Chipotle in California left about 200 ill. And in September, salmonella infected dozens of Chipotle customers in Minnesota. In that case, tainted tomatoes were to blame.\u00a0 E. coli poisoning has surfaced from time-to-time in the fast-food industry, notably in 1993 at Jack in the Box, where beef patties tainted with E. coli struck more than 700 people, including four who died. And in 2006, E. coli sickened more than 70 diners at Taco Bell restaurants. Still, it\u2019s odd to see so many issues at one chain, said Benjamin Chapman, an associate professor and food-safety specialist at North Carolina State University. \"It\u2019s not very common to see outbreaks linked to the same place, the same brand, in a couple of months with different issues,\" Chapman said. \"It does make you wonder how they\u2019re managing food safety as a whole.\"","timestamp":1449561782.0,"participant_ids":["CMG:US","326463Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-08\/chipotle-s-greatest-strength-is-now-its-greatest-weakness-too","subject":"Chipotle's Biggest Strength Is Suddenly Its Biggest Weakness"},{"body":" Textron Inc. is working to drum up buyers for its self-funded, $20 million Scorpion military jet, betting the plane may one day generate thousands of sales. After two years of pitches, Chief Executive Officer Scott Donnelly is still trying to prove the case for the light-attack fighter, created with off-the-shelf commercial systems and outside of the military acquisition process. \u201cWe\u2019re closer every day, but not there yet,\u201d Donnelly said at the Paris Air Show Monday, where the first Scorpion is parked on display for customers. \u201cThere is evaluation work going on, there are a lot of people looking at it. It is government business, so you have to go through budgetary cycles.\u201d Textron\u2019s new jet and the pull-out-the-stops sales effort exemplify the kind of business done the aerospace industry\u2019s largest and oldest event. About 139,000 trade visitors and 2,260 exhibitors from 47 countries are gathering this week to strike deals and find markets for innovations. Donnelly\u2019s days are a blur of back-to-back meetings with government delegations, suppliers and customers of Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron, whose product portfolio includes Bell helicopters, Cessna jets and even the riding lawn mowers that tailor golf course fairways. To reach the show, the Scorpion completed its second trans-Atlantic flight and reached 400 hours of flight-testing. It will travel around Europe for several weeks after the event for trial runs by interested companies. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of where we expect it to be,\u201d Donnelly said in an interview. \u201cWe have more and more people paying interest, people who want to fly it.\u201d Two retractable pods attached to the model\u2019s belly this year give pilots cameras, light and heat sensors and multi-purpose radar. Textron plans other changes for next year including static testing, the first flight of a production aircraft and assessing live weapons systems. Textron\u2019s target markets for the Scorpion are countries that need search-and-rescue aircraft, trainers for military pilots and light attack fighters for border patrol but can\u2019t afford separate aircraft fleets for each function or state-of-the-art weapons systems such as Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s F-35. \u201cThe Scorpion is a little bit risky,\u201d Brian Foley, an aviation market analyst, said in an interview before the show. \u201cTraditionally a company that builds an aircraft on spec without an RFP is taking a tremendous gamble.\u201d Textron is anticipating demand that may never emerge, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace and defense analyst with Teal Group, a Fairfax, Virginia-based consultant. Countries looking to replace Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s F-5 jets, also developed on spec, trainers and military and Russian aircraft will probably look to supersonic models like South Korea\u2019s KAI T-50s rather than planes powered by business-jet engines, Aboulafia said. \u201cSomebody investing in a new aircraft? That\u2019s commendable,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cIt\u2019s even pretty neat-looking, too.

The $106 billion maker of aircraft engines and elevators   in March that it would divest Sikorsky, either by selling it or spinning it off. A final decision by United Technologies will come in about a month. Analysts initially said a spinoff of Sikorsky was  . The business was acquired by United Technologies in 1929, so a sale now would result in a significant capital gain and tax bill. But there\u2019s an alternative. United Technologies could spin off Sikorsky and then merge it with Textron through a stock swap, in a transaction known as a Reverse Morris Trust. As long as United Technologies\u2019 shareholders ended up with more than 50 percent of the combined entity, the deal would be tax-free. Textron\u2019s $13 billion market value makes the manufacturer of Bell helicopters much closer to the right size for this type of a transaction than giants such as Boeing Co. or Lockheed Martin Corp. that could also be interested. \u201cTextron is the only one that really qualifies,\u201d Jason Gursky, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cYou have to have two roughly equal partners come together.\u201d Sikorsky should be valued at about $8 billion as a standalone entity, analysts have estimated. That means Textron would need to shed about $3 billion in assets and take on some debt to make a deal work, according to Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Textron can do that by spinning off its industrial unit, which makes golf carts and fuel systems, he said. That has a side benefit of better focusing the company, which also makes Cessna aircraft, on the aerospace and defense industries. \u201cIt\u2019s in our space, so of course we\u2019ll pay attention to it,\u201d said Textron Chief Executive Officer Scott Donnelly in a May 7 interview. \u201cObviously at this stage of the game, it is very much directed and managed by what UTC wants to do.\u201d United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes said in an interview last month that he\u2019d sell Sikorsky if buyers can overcome the tax hurdles. Boeing, Lockheed and Airbus Group NV are considering bids for Sikorsky, or taking a minority stake, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. An acquisition of Sikorsky would be the aerospace and defense industry\u2019s biggest deal since 2012 when United Technologies bought Goodrich Corp. for more than $16 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For Textron, one benefit would be getting major new military contracts as deliveries drop off for the V-22 Osprey combat aircraft that the company co-develops with Boeing, said Doug Rothacker, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. An acquisition of Sikorsky would give Textron a bigger and broader slice of the commercial helicopter market. \u201cTextron makes little helicopters, Sikorsky makes bigger helicopters,\u201d said Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen Group Inc. \u201cThey\u2019re both in military, and in different areas. The fit is probably best with Textron.\u201d Textron may have to stretch financially to get a deal done. Sprague of Vertical Research estimated it would need to take on about $1 billion of debt. Also, combining with Sikorsky to create a helicopter powerhouse may draw regulatory scrutiny, said Chip Pettengill, principal and fund manager at United Technologies investor Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel Inc. Should United Technologies instead pursue a spinoff of Sikorsky, the division may end up getting acquired eventually anyway. Buyers just may wait awhile before making a move. Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Corp. or Boeing may be among the defense companies intrigued by the chance to buy the helicopter maker, said Pettengill. London-based BAE Systems Plc is another possibility, said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer at Lexington Institute. Boeing is the likeliest buyer among the big defense companies because Sikorsky would complement its existing U.S. helicopter manufacturing business. Production of Sikorsky\u2019s new combat-rescue helicopter and other U.S. programs should start to ramp up early in the next decade, which would soften the blow from dwindling deliveries of Chicago-based Boeing\u2019s F-15 and F\/A-18 fighter planes. While Boeing is a good fit strategically and financially, antitrust objections would make a transaction difficult, according to Citigroup\u2019s Gursky. Combined, Boeing and Sikorsky would control more than 80 percent of the U.S. military helicopter market and more than 60 percent of the global military market, he said. Chaz Bickers, a Boeing spokesman, declined to comment. If Textron can overcome its own challenges to a deal, it\u2019s got a prime opportunity to approach Sikorsky now. \u201cIf they could do it, I think it would make a lot of sense for the companies,\u201d Bahl & Gaynor\u2019s Pettengill, whose firm oversees about $14 billion, said in a phone interview. \u201cThere would be wonderful synergies there just in terms of the engineering, product know-how, the manufacturing.\u201d","timestamp":1432058859.0,"participant_ids":["TXT:US","UTX:US","BA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-19\/textron-is-best-option-for-sikorsky-sale-over-spinoff-real-m-a","subject":"Textron Is Best Option for Sikorsky Sale Over Spinoff"},{"body":" Lockheed Martin Corp. is in advanced talks to acquire United Technologies Corp.\u2019s Sikorsky helicopter business, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Nike Inc. won\u2019t renew its apparel contract with the University of Texas before the company\u2019s exclusive negotiating window expires on Oct. 1, according to people with direct knowledge of the talks. That opens the bidding to Nike rivals including Under Armour Inc. and Adidas AG, the companies most likely to pay to put their logos on every uniform the Longhorns wear -- and on the millions of dollars in gear Texas fans buy. Recent deals suggest that could be worth more than $15 million annually. Earlier this year, Nike agreed to pay the University of Michigan   over 11 years, ousting Adidas from Ann Arbor. Last year, Under Armour   to the University of Notre Dame, which said at the time the contract was the largest in the history of college sports. The exact terms of that deal aren\u2019t public, but it included an equity stake in Under Armour for the university. Texas\u2019s original contract with Nike was substantially smaller. In 2000, Texas ended its relationship with Reebok for a seven-year, $17 million contract with Nike, according to the Austin American-Statesman. Texas and Nike have since extended that contract three times. Nike still has the contractual right to match any offer Texas receives, according to a person with knowledge of the agreement. Adidas and Under Armour have been stretching the market for marquee college programs and for professional players. Adidas recently wooed Houston Rockets guard James Harden from Nike for a whopping $200 million over 13 years. And Under Armour drove up the bidding for National Basketball Association MVP Kevin Durant, who ultimately stayed with Nike for $300 million over 10 years. Texas athletic department spokesman Nick Voinis declined to comment, as did Nike spokesman KeJuan Wilkins. Spokeswomen from Adidas and Under Armour didn\u2019t immediately respond to voice messages and e-mails. Texas is already the richest athletic program in the country. It earned $161.3 million during the 2013-14 school year, according to its most recent financial report, and unlike most college athletics programs, it covers its own expenses. Most of that money comes from the football team, which turned a $74.1 million profit in the 2013-14 school year, according to the U.S. Education Department. That makes it the most profitable team in college football by almost $10 million. Michigan is No. 2, with $64.6 million in profit. Negotiations come at a tumultuous time for Longhorns sports. Athletic Director Steve Patterson resigned earlier this month, after repeated clashes with school officials and boosters. The football team has lost three of its first four games this season; it plays No. 4 Texas Christian University on Saturday. Texas has already shown its willingness to break ties with a market leader. In March, the school said it would part with its licensing representative, Collegiate Licensing Company, a unit of WME\/IMG, once its agreement expires in June 2016, in favor of Learfield Licensing Partners. The change was designed to save the UT system about $1 million annually.

The billionaire\u2019s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., has made industrial purchases before, including the 2006 buyout of Iscar Metalworking Cos. and the takeover of railroad giant Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2010. With Buffett\u2019s latest deal, the agreement announced Monday to buy Precision Castparts Corp., he\u2019s widening his purview. \u201cHe\u2019s stepping out away from what they\u2019re normally involved in,\u201d said Walter Todd, who oversees about $1.1 billion as chief investment officer for Greenwood Capital Associates. \u201cI doubt this would be a one-off situation. I would think they would now use Precision Castparts as a platform to go out and build some scale in this area.\u201d Airplane-part manufacturers from B\/E Aerospace Inc. to KLX Inc. and Rockwell Collins Inc. rose on news of the deal, in part on speculation they too could become targets. A company such as parts maker Astronics Corp., which makes aircraft lighting, could also complement Precision Castparts, said Todd, whose firm owns Astronics shares. Prior to the Precision Castparts announcement,  about Buffett targets had focused on food-related companies after his big bets on H.J. Heinz Co. and Kraft Foods Group Inc. with 3G Capital. \u201cThis creates a couple of different new M&A venues for Berkshire to play off of,\u201d said Joel Levington, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Any acquisition Buffett makes in the near term will probably be smaller. He told CNBC that the Precision Castparts takeover takes him \u201cout of the market for an elephant,\u201d his code word for a mega-deal. Companies such as $2 billion KLX or $1.2 billion Astronics would be pocket change for Berkshire, which will still have about $40 billion in cash after the Precision Castparts takeover closes. And Buffett has a history of using acquisitions as starting points for more deals. In 2000, for example, Berkshire bought MidAmerican Energy Holdings. The utility business -- now called Berkshire Hathaway Energy -- became a platform for buying power companies in states including Nevada and Oregon, as well as an electric transmission business in Canada. It\u2019s also a regular investor in wind and solar projects. Buffett\u2019s deal for chemical maker Lubrizol in 2011 also turned out to provide opportunities for more deals. Last year, the unit   two businesses from Weatherford International Plc that make products for the oil-and-gas industry. Precision Castparts is \u201cone of the companies that he buys with the idea of not only enhancing the current return on the cash that he used to buy it, but also as a good source of bolt-on acquisitions,\u201d said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management, which holds Berkshire shares among the $1.9 billion in assets it manages. \u201cThat company will not be constrained anymore by what its stock does.\u201d Since taking over as chief executive officer of Precision Castparts in 2002, Mark Donegan has spent at least $9 billion on almost 40 takeovers. While most of his deals have tended to be for less than $1 billion, the size of Precision Castparts\u2019 targets could grow now that it has \u201ca potentially larger purse to work with,\u201d said Jeff Windau, a St. Louis-based analyst at Edward Jones & Co. \u201cIt does give them more flexibility,\u201d Windau said. Precision Castparts \u201ccould have been getting a little constrained, just based on the fact that their business has been under pressure.\u201d The source of the pressure was the energy-equipment business, which has been struggling amid the slump in commodity prices. Precision Castparts earns about 70 percent of its revenue from the aerospace industry and 17 percent from power-generation customers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buffett could also look to build out the energy division with acquisitions. The deep discounts in that industry could entice the value investor. On the other hand, he could just get rid of the oil-and-gas parts of Precision Castparts, said Todd of Greenwood. \u201cHonestly it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if six months from now, they sold that part of the business off,\u201d Todd said. \u201cClearly they\u2019re   of the depressed valuation due to that business but I think the main focus is probably the aerospace.\u201d","timestamp":1439235396.0,"participant_ids":["PCP:US","ATRO:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-10\/buffett-aerospace-play-signals-further-deal-ambitions-real-m-a","subject":"Buffett Aerospace Play Signals Further Deal Ambitions: Real M&A"},{"body":" Kraft Heinz Co., the food company that counts Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. as its largest shareholder, is eliminating about 2,500 jobs in the U.S. and Canada under the new management.

Technology giants have led the way, including Google\u2019s   Dec. 3 for 625 megawatts of U.S. wind power and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s   wind deal Dec. 1. Other industries are following suit, with businesses, universities, government agencies and other non-utility buyers accounting for 32 percent of U.S. contracts this year through early November, according to the  , up from 5 percent for all of 2013. Three parallel trends are driving the shift. Companies have realized that buying renewable energy from developers is often cheaper than getting power from their local utilities. At the same time, a growing number of utilities have met state\u00a0renewable-energy mandates and are putting the brakes on new deals. Meanwhile, U.S. wind installations are expected to climb 76 percent this year. \u201cIf utilities in Kansas don\u2019t need power right now, you as a developer either are forced to sit on the project for years or find a different class of buyer,\u201d\u00a0said Quayle Hodek, chief executive officer of  , a Boulder, Colorado-based consultant that matches Fortune 500 companies with renewable energy projects looking to sell electricity. That\u2019s opening up a new market for developers, which typically can\u2019t line up financing for new wind farms until they\u2019ve also lined up long-term buyers for the power. Companies are creating \u201ca new source of demand,\u201d said Jacob Susman, CEO of OwnEnergy Inc., a New York-based developer of mid-sized wind farms that was acquired by Electricite de France SA in August. OwnEnergy\u2019s customers have included Yahoo! Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. Under these deals, a corporate buyer typically signs a long-term contract for the electricity with the developer. The power is delivered through the local grid; rarely is there a direct transmission line from the wind farm itself. For businesses, these contracts provide two main advantages: price and predictability. \u201cDay one, we\u2019re going to be saving 10 percent over what we\u2019re paying today,\u201d said Rame Hemstreet, chief energy officer at Kaiser Permanente, which has a contract to buy   of wind and solar capacity from NextEra Energy Inc. Not only are prices lower, they\u2019re often locked in by years-long power-purchase deals. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wonder what our power prices will be for 20 years,\u201d\u00a0Rick Needham, Google\u2019s director of green business operations, said in an interview. While companies are keen to help the environment, it must first make economic sense, said Hodek. \u201cThis is not just for the environment -- this can be something to provide long-term cost stability,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies are saying, \u2018What am I missing out on? Let\u2019s do this,\u2019 \u201d he said. At the same time, demand from some utilities is slowing.\u00a0 Most states are on track to meet renewable portfolio standards, policies that require utilities to source a certain percentage of their power from clean sources, and five already have, according to Susan Sloan, vice president of state policy at AWEA. That\u2019s not slowing wind installations, which are expected to reach 9 gigawatts this year in the U.S., up from 5.1 gigawatts in 2014, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That means more developers than ever are seeking power-purchase agreements. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of PPAs in part because there\u2019s never been so much power under development,\u201d said Amy Grace, North American wind analyst with New Energy Finance. Technology companies including Google were some of the first movers, often to run power-hungry data centers. The\u00a0Alphabet Inc. company has signed deals for about 2 gigawatts of   since 2010. Including the five contracts the company announced Dec. 3, it has deals for more than 1.3 gigawatts of wind power in the U.S and Sweden. Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also made significant purchases of clean energy. That\u2019s spreading to other other industries. \u201cThe trend is extending beyond tech companies, which are the usual adopters,\u201d said Hannah Hunt, a research analyst at AWEA. Non-utility buyers have purchased more than 800 megawatts of wind power this year. Owens Corning, a supplier of building materials and other industrial products, announced Nov. 13 a deal to purchase 125 megawatts from a wind farm under development in Texas. Dow Chemical Co., the U.S. General Services Administration, and Ohio State University have also struck deals to buy wind power from developers instead of utilities. \u201cThe market is a lot smaller without non-utility customers,\u201d Travis Bryan, chief operating officer at Seattle-based developer OneEnergy Renewables, said in an e-mail. \u201cIn certain markets like New York and Massachusetts, non-utility customers have been absolutely critical and will likely continue to remain so going forward.\u201d","timestamp":1449244285.0,"participant_ids":["GOOGL:US","0027351D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-04\/google-clean-power-deal-shows-wind-farms-finding-new-customers","subject":"Google's Clean-Power Deal Shows Wind Farms Finding New Customers"},{"body":"  Andreas Halvorsen\u2019s Viking Global Investors bought a stake worth about $1 billion in Amazon.com Inc. in the second quarter and almost doubled its position in Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

Goldcorp is offering Probe investors 0.1755 shares for each share they own, the Vancouver-based company said today in a statement. The offer of about C$5 per share is 49 percent more than Probe\u2019s closing price on Friday. Goldcorp, which operates mines in the Americas, is among producers seeking to reduce costs and focus on the most profitable operations after gold prices fell for a second consecutive year. Goldcorp said it can start up and operate Probe\u2019s high-grade Borden gold project more cheaply by processing ore at its nearby Porcupine operation in the Canadian province. \u201cThis strategic acquisition is the latest example of our commitment to upgrading the quality of Goldcorp\u2019s overall asset portfolio,\u201d Goldcorp Chief Executive Officer Chuck Jeannes said in the statement. Probe surged 50 percent to C$5.04 at the close in Toronto, while Goldcorp rose 0.6 percent to C$28.67. The announcement marks a return to dealmaking by Probe Chairman Jamie Sokalsky, the former Barrick Gold Corp. CEO who joined the company after leaving his position at Goldcorp\u2019s biggest rival in September. \u201cThis transaction is an excellent outcome for Probe shareholders as it provides them with a significant premium that recognizes the value embedded in Borden,\u201d Sokalsky said in Toronto-based Probe\u2019s statement. The transaction value is \u201crelatively in line\u201d with where companies with preproduction assets are trading and within the range of recent acquisition valuations, Greg Barnes, a Toronto-based analyst at TD Securities Inc., said in a note. The purchase is Goldcorp\u2019s first since the company tried unsuccessfully to buy another Canadian producer, Osisko Mining Corp., in an unsolicited bid announced a year ago. Goldcorp terminated its C$3.26 billion offer for Osisko in April after Canadian competitors Yamana Gold Inc. and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. reached a friendly takeover deal with Osisko. The acquisition announced today has been approved by both companies\u2019 boards and is expected to close in late March, subject to approval by two-thirds of Probe\u2019s shareholders. Agnico owns 8.1 percent of Probe shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In addition to Goldcorp shares, Probe shareholders will get one third of a share in a new exploration company that will hold some of Probe\u2019s properties, which include a chromite project in Northern Ontario. Goldcorp, which already owns 9.3 percent of Probe, will hold about 9.3 percent of the new company. Goldcorp was advised by GMP Securities LP and law firm Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP in Canada.

After taking over operations this year at the Kalgoorlie Super Pit in Western Australia,\u00a0Newmont would be interested in buying out\u00a0Barrick\u2019s 50 percent stake,\u00a0Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg said Tuesday in an interview at the Denver Gold Forum. Mines in Nevada that Barrick is marketing are not of interest to the Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company, he said. Gold\u2019s more than 40 percent slump from a 2011 peak has miners scrambling to adapt in slightly different ways. Some, like Toronto-based Barrick, are downsizing to focus on key assets. Others such as Goldcorp Inc. are building war chests for future growth. In Newmont\u2019s case, the focus is on improving asset quality as well as selectively seeking acquisitions, Goldberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s one asset that we know pretty well and if we could obtain it at the right value that would be one that we\u2019d be interested in considering,\u201d he said, referring to the Super Pit. \u201cOf their current portfolio in Nevada, we don\u2019t have any interest in the assets that they\u2019re looking to sell.\u201d Barrick is trying to offload a package of six mines in Nevada and Montana. Newmont and Barrick discussed the possibility of combining their operations several times over the past two decades. The latest merger talks ended in a very public way in April 2014, with both sides blaming the other for the breakdown. Since then, both companies have been working to bring down costs and debt levels.\u00a0Newmont isn\u2019t focused on resuming talks with Barrick, Goldberg said. Newmont\u2019s giant Conga project in Peru continues to work on social acceptance measures after development was halted amid protests, he said, adding that the project remains viable even at today\u2019s metal prices. Just as Barrick has suggested it may seek partnerships to share costs at its stalled Pascua-Lama project, Newmont may also bring in a partner at Conga. \u00a0 In Indonesia, Newmont expects to deliver authorities required documentation in the coming weeks as part of a rolling export permit renewal process. In the meantime, operations are running at full capacity and authorities haven\u2019t asked the company to list on the local exchange, he said. Indonesia, home of Freeport-McMoRan Inc.\u2019s giant Grasberg mine, wants mining companies to commit to building a smelter. While Newmont is happy to supply concentrate to a smelter and has put a $25 million bond toward its construction, \"we\u2019re not smelter experts,\u201d he Goldberg said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll work with other parties to help develop,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, Freeport\u2019s the logical one.\u201d Newmont shares have lost 35 percent in the past year, while Barrick has plunged 53 percent.

A group of pension funds which sued over the securities said in a court filing Jan. 8 that the \u201csettlement in principle\u201d isn\u2019t final and the parties plan to seek preliminary approval by Feb. 2. The pension funds, led by the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Mississippi and the New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund, sued in September 2008 in Manhattan federal court over the securities, which Bear Stearns issued in 2006 and 2007. In 2012, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he did the U.S. a favor by buying Bear Stearns and that he might not go through with it again because of how much the deal ultimately cost. At the time, Dimon estimated losses tied to Bear Stearns at as much as $10 billion. JPMorgan completed its rescue of Bear Stearns after the Federal Reserve agreed to take control of a $30 billion portfolio of mortgage-linked Bear Stearns assets. Eric Schneiderman, New York state\u2019s attorney general, sued JPMorgan in 2012, claiming that Bear Stearns businesses had deceived mortgage-bond investors about defective loans backing the securities they bought. The result was \u201cmonumental losses\u201d that haven\u2019t been fully identified, Schneiderman said. JPMorgan reached a $13 billion federal-state settlement of claims over the mortgage-bond sales, of which $613 million went to New York to resolve the state\u2019s allegations against the bank. According to the pension funds in the class-action case, offering documents shown to investors contained false and misleading statements about the securities, holding them out as the highest quality and with low risk. JPMorgan has had some success in challenging lawsuits over actions by Bear Stearns. In February, the bank won dismissal of a suit brought by hedge fund SRM Global claiming it had lost more than $200 million tied to its reliance on Bear Stearns\u2019s representations about the value of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities.

Kansas Governor\u2019s Campaign Loans Under Investigation by FBI Loans made to Kansas Governor Sam Brownback\u2019s re-election campaign are being probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has ordered the director of the state\u2019s governmental ethics commission to testify before a grand jury. The U.S. seeks information on loans made to the Brownback for Governor Campaign in 2013 and 2014, according to the Dec. 2 subpoena. Carol Williams, the commission\u2019s executive director, who is ordered to testify Jan. 14, declined to comment on the subpoena. Brownback, a Republican, in November won a second term, surviving a backlash to his anti-tax crusade that pitted him against fellow Republicans. The win for the 58-year-old former U.S. senator, who was first elected governor amid the Tea Party advances of 2010, kept alive his plan to make Kansas a laboratory for the theory that economic development will more than make up for revenue lost to lower taxes. \u201cThe campaign followed all applicable laws and ethics regulations, and this investigation has no merit,\u201d Eileen Hawley, Brownback\u2019s spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cIt is a common practice for candidates to make loans to their campaigns and any loans were done in compliance with Kansas law and ethics regulations.\u201d Jim Cross, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Wichita, declined to comment on whether there\u2019s an investigation of Brownback\u2019s campaign finances. Brownback won the governorship after eight years of Democrats in the state\u2019s top office and moved swiftly to leave his mark. He signed bills to restrict abortion and require voters to show photo identification, and called for overhauls of pension, health-care and public-school financing. For more,  . Prosecutors Seeks Five-Year Jail Term for Swiss WikiLeaks Banker Swiss prosecutors asked a Zurich court to sentence Rudolf Elmer, a former employee of Julius Baer Group Ltd., to five years and three months in prison for revealing details of client accounts via WikiLeaks. Elmer, 59, is accused of violating the country\u2019s financial secrecy laws in a campaign to raise awareness of the use of Swiss bank accounts for illegal activity including tax evasion. He also allegedly offered bank data to the German government and fabricated a letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel from the Swiss bank, advising her to close an account. Countries including the U.S., the U.K. and Germany have used testimony from former Swiss bankers or stolen client data to pursue offshore tax dodgers. Judges heard closing arguments today when the trial resumed for the first time since Elmer collapsed at the opening on Dec. 10, forcing the court to postpone the proceedings. His lawyer said he is still not well but he seemed in better condition. Giger said Elmer should serve at least three-and-a-half years in prison. The three-judge panel will also hear from Elmer\u2019s lawyer, Ganden Tethong, before delivering a verdict and possible sentence. Elmer has already spent about five months in detention, which would be factored into any sentence. Elmer worked at a unit of Julius Baer in the Cayman Islands until 2002. He allegedly uploaded data to WikiLeaks as early as 2007. In January 2011, he gave two compact discs to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at a press conference in London. He said at the start of the trial in December that the discs were empty. The former banker was detained in January 2011 and held on a judge\u2019s order after prosecutors argued that he might tamper with evidence. He has continued to campaign against an offshore banking network that he says enables wealthy people to hide money from authorities. Caesars Bondholders Say Bankruptcy Won\u2019t Stop Fraud Lawsuit Bondholders of Caesars Entertainment Corp. will continue their fraud lawsuit against the casino company controlled by Apollo Global Management LLC even after its operating unit\u2019s planned bankruptcy filing around Jan. 15, they told a judge. Caesars was asking a Delaware judge to toss the lawsuit, saying bankrupt companies are automatically protected from litigation. The bondholders, who accused Caesars and its directors from Apollo of \u201clooting\u201d assets from the insolvent unit that owes them money, said their claims against those parties aren\u2019t affected by the rule. The Las Vegas-based company has made agreements with a few lenders to try to use bankruptcy court to cut about $10 billion of debt from the money-losing unit that runs the casinos. Those who sign up must agree to drop out of lawsuits, Caesars says in regulatory filings. Caesars plans to use bankruptcy court to turn the operating unit, which has about $18.4 billion in debt, into a real estate investment trust that would be given to senior lenders.

The crash, the   involving a CSX train laden with Bakken oil, promises to add to the public-safety debate over North American crude-by-rail shipments. The Obama administration is   standards after a series of oil-train derailments led by a 2013 Quebec accident that killed 47 people and non-fatal explosions in the U.S. Sarah Feinberg, acting administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, and Chief Safety Officer Robert Lauby were traveling to the crash site, and investigators from the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration were already on the scene, according to the FRA. As firefighters worked Tuesday to douse the remaining flames following Monday\u2019s derailment, authorities\u2019 focus turned to learning why the train came off the tracks and whether the cargo of North Dakota Bakken crude had reached a municipal water intake on the Kanawha River. Ice dams may have kept the crude from reaching a local water system, and authorities are testing samples to be sure the spill was contained, said Terrance Lively, a spokesman for the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety in Charleston. \u201cWe do know there is some crude oil in the stream,\u201d Lively said Tuesday by telephone. Gary Sease, a CSX spokesman, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday about track conditions and the train\u2019s speed at the time of the accident, which occurred after 1 p.m. on Monday. The rural nature of the crash site may have limited the fallout from having 27 oil cars derail and as many 15 of them catch fire. Even with power lines damaged, the possible jeopardy to the water system and Governor Earl Ray Tomblin declaring a state of emergency covering Kanawha and Fayette counties, only about 85 people had to use local shelters, Lively said. CSX is cooperating with federal authorities, Sease said by e-mail. The train -- with 107 oil cars, two cars of sand and a pair of locomotives -- was headed for Yorktown, Virginia, according to Sease. The destination was a rail-to-marine terminal operated by Plains All American Pipeline LP, according to New York-based ClipperData, which tracks waterborne crude movements. A Plains All American spokesman, Brad Leone, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a voice message and e-mail left before regular business hours Tuesday. The April 2014 crude-train derailment in Lynchburg, Virginia, also involved a CSX train headed to the Plains All American facility. About 15 cars came off the tracks, and the resulting fire led to dramatic video of flames and billowing smoke against the backdrop of a small city\u2019s downtown. The tank units on the West Virginia train were CPC-1232 rail cars made with either 7\/16-inch (1.1-centimeter) carbon steel shells and 1\/8-inch carbon steel jackets, or cars with 1\/2-inch carbon steel shells, according to an e-mail from Sease. The new U.S. standards for trains carrying crude would first require companies to upgrade tank cars known as DOT-111s, which safety investigators have said are prone to puncture in rail accidents, a person familiar with the proposal said this month. The draft rule also would require that new cars be built with steel shells that are 9\/16th of an inch thick, people familiar with the plan said. The walls of the current cars, both DOT-111s and the newer CPC-1232 models, are 7\/16th of an inch thick. Monday\u2019s derailment was the second in three days in North America. Canadian National Railway Co. shut its main line linking western and eastern Canada after an eastbound train carrying crude oil came off the tracks in Ontario. The train of 100 cars, all carrying crude from Canada\u2019s oil-producing region of Alberta to eastern Canada, derailed just before midnight Saturday in a remote and wooded area about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Gogama, Ontario, spokesman Patrick Waldron said in an e-mail.","timestamp":1424127473.0,"participant_ids":["PAA:US","CSX:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-17\/emergency-declared-in-w-virginia-counties-after-csx-derailment","subject":"Fiery Oil-Train Crash Probed by U.S. Rail, Pipeline Regul"},{"body":" California Governor Jerry Brown declared an emergency in Santa Barbara County after a Plains All American Pipeline LP oil conduit leaked as much as 2,500 barrels of crude along the state\u2019s southern coastline.

A financial adviser quits late on a Friday and spends the next couple of days helping his new employer solicit his old customers. There\u2019s even a broker pact that suggests it is all a refined gentleman\u2019s game. Until things fall apart. A new arbitration case alleges that Oppenheimer & Co. stepped well beyond the bounds of propriety in mounting a client raid over a three-day weekend earlier this summer. Such incursions are common, according to people in the industry. What\u2019s unusual is for details of these raids to become public, in part thanks to an industry pact that governs broker job-hopping in an effort to tamp down litigation. The Oppenheimer matter -- told through arbitration and court filings, letters and e-mails -- provides a vivid study of some of the new strains to the old ground rules of client raiding. On the Friday afternoon before Memorial Day, an investment adviser with a small firm called Euro Pacific Capital composed a short note to his chief executive: He was resigning, effective immediately. The adviser, Steven Savoy, pressed \"send\" from inside an Oppenheimer office in Saddle Brook, New Jersey, according to Euro Pacific, launching a plan weeks in the making. Euro Pacific claims in its arbitration complaint that Savoy had left with confidential client lists that he and his new boss used to contact scores of people over the holiday weekend. Letters announcing Savoy\u2019s move, with tabbed and highlighted account-transfer forms, allegedly sat ready for FedEx delivery. Euro Pacific complained. Oppenheimer dismissed Savoy before he could collect what amounted to a signing bonus of more than a quarter-million dollars. Instead of holding down a new job at a bigger firm, he\u2019s out of the business. Savoy, reached by telephone, declined to comment. Euro Pacific says the solicitations cost it more than $10 million in funds under management. Its complaint, filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, asks for some $40 million in restitution from Oppenheimer. Euro Pacific also asked a federal court in Connecticut to keep Oppenheimer and Savoy from soliciting its customers until the matter is arbitrated. Euro Pacific\u2019s complaints to the court and Finra accuse Oppenheimer of slander, conspiracy, unjust enrichment and theft of trade secrets. Euro Pacific\u2019s claims are without merit, Oppenheimer said in a statement, disputing that hiring one broker for one month could constitute a raiding-related claim. In a countersuit filed this month with Finra, the financial industry\u2019s self-regulatory body, Oppenheimer said Savoy told them he had no contractual obligations restricting his move to the new firm. Savoy\u2019s defection emerges in rich detail in part because the source of many of Euro Pacific\u2019s allegations is Savoy himself. Facing a suit from his old employer and dumped by his new one, Savoy began cooperating with Euro Pacific. A person close to Savoy said he did what his employer asked him to do, and ended up as a pawn in a bigger fight between warring firms. Oppenheimer, like many big firms, has been on both sides of raiding  . About a dozen such disagreements end in arbitration awards each year, said Alison Jimenez, president of Dynamic Securities Analytics Inc. and senior strategist for RegTelligence. Many more are settled privately between firms. That\u2019s thanks in part to the  , introduced by three big investment firms about a decade ago to put guardrails on client poaching. More than 1,300 firms have signed on to the protocol, which limits the client information brokers can take with them when they move firms -- name, address, phone number, e-mail address and an account title. Some firms are rethinking whether the protocol offers enough protection. That\u2019s especially true of banks that provide their in-house advisers with client leads from their own broad databases, and see those clients as belonging to the house, not the broker. Merrill Lynch, while championing the protocol, says it has augmented it in recent years with another policy: It provides in-house leads only to brokers who agree not to take those clients with them if they leave. \u201cSome in the industry are now trying to chip away at the protocol,\u201d says Jonathan Pollard, an attorney in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, specializing in employment competition issues. That makes an interesting test case of Westport, Connecticut-based Euro Pacific, a shop of about 30 brokers that never signed the protocol. Oppenheimer, with more than 1,300 financial advisers, is a signatory. Savoy, 43, arrived at Euro Pacific in 2008 with no clients, according to the Connecticut complaint. Euro Pacific\u2019s chief executive Peter Schiff, an investment-book author with frequent media appearances, said most of his firm\u2019s clients are drawn to his investment philosophy. \"Clients come to Euro Pacific to work with me,\" Schiff said by telephone. \"They want some of their money with Peter Schiff. They don\u2019t want to invest with Steve Savoy.\" Savoy was overseeing $68 million in assets around April 2015 when he started speaking with Daniel O\u2019Dell, the manager of Oppenheimer\u2019s Saddle Brook office, according to the Finra and court complaints. Savoy was under financial pressure after Euro Pacific changed its pay structure, the broker wrote to O\u2019Dell in an e-mail included in Oppenheimer\u2019s Finra filing. In an early meeting, O\u2019Dell asked Savoy to provide a list of Euro Pacific clients on a flash drive with account statements for each, according to Euro Pacific\u2019s Finra complaint. Savoy expressed concern that doing so would conflict with confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements he\u2019d signed, it added. O\u2019Dell told Savoy that Oppenheimer had a process for using confidential client data from a broker\u2019s previous employer and used such information \u201call the time,\u201d Euro Pacific said.  O\u2019Dell predicted that when Schiff learned of Savoy\u2019s move, he would \u201cflap his wings, flail his arms and make noise.\u201d But Oppenheimer could likely settle the matter\u00a0with a $15,000 or $20,00O payment to Euro Pacific, O\u2019Dell told Savoy, according to Euro Pacific\u2019s Finra complaint. O\u2019Dell didn\u2019t respond to messages requesting comment, and Oppenheimer declined to make him available. The firm, in its Finra filing, said it asked Savoy for any employment agreements to support his claim that he was under no restrictions. Savoy, who had been a managing director at Euro Pacific, didn\u2019t provide any, it said. On May 6, while still at Euro Pacific, Savoy downloaded contact and account information on 421 clients onto a flash drive, according to the Finra and court filings. The next day Oppenheimer sent him an offer letter with a $280,000 sign-on bonus, which Savoy signed and returned with the drive, according to the Finra complaint. O\u2019Dell, it added, told Savoy he should resign on the Friday before Memorial Day \u201cso we can get a head start.\u201d That Thursday, Savoy left his Euro Pacific office without indicating he was quitting, the federal and Finra complaints cited colleagues as saying. The next day at 2 p.m., he sent his one-line e-mail to Schiff. \"Please see attached document,\u201d it read. It was his resignation letter. By then, Savoy\u2019s new Saddle Brook office was allegedly filled with account-transfer packages. Each included a letter signed by O\u2019Dell, which was prepared while Savoy was still a Euro Pacific employee, the firm told Finra. Over the next three days, it said, Savoy solicited his old clients \u201con a mass scale.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until the Tuesday morning that Euro Pacific learned Savoy was gone, according to e-mails filed with Finra. By then, Euro Pacific said in a letter to Oppenheimer, \u201cpossibly over a hundred\u201d customers had already received calls, e-mails or FedEx packages with the signature-ready transfer forms. Savoy and Oppenheimer misappropriated trade secrets, conspired to breach Savoy\u2019s confidentiality pacts and slandered Euro Pacific, the firm alleged in its Connecticut request for a restraining order, to which Oppenheimer consented. Oppenheimer, in its Finra response, said it never possessed the Euro Pacific data. Oppenheimer terminated Savoy early June 22, without his lump payout. The next month, Euro Pacific dropped Savoy as a target of its suit. Now, Savoy is selecting an attorney, said the person close to him, as he battles Oppenheimer\u2019s allegation that he lied about the terms of his Euro Pacific employment and duped Oppenheimer into hiring him. Oppenheimer told Finra it wants Savoy to foot the bill for any financial damages it may suffer.\u00a0 The case is scheduled to go before Finra arbitrators in late November.","timestamp":1442383200.0,"participant_ids":["0834736D:US","DELL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-16\/brokers-battle-over-memorial-day-raid-reveals-industry-strains","subject":"The Weekend Client Raid That Blew Up:\u00a0How a Brokerage Battle Went Public"},{"body":" Tahoe Resources Inc. agreed to buy Rio Alto Mining Ltd. for about C$1.35 billion ($1.09 billion) to add the La Arena mine in Peru in the gold industry\u2019s biggest takeover in almost 10 months. The cash-and-stock offer is valued at C$4 a share, or 22 percent more than Vancouver-based Rio Alto\u2019s Feb. 6 closing share price, both companies said Monday in a statement. Unlike many other precious-metal miners struggling amid recent commodity-price declines, Tahoe has gained financial strength after its Escobal silver mine in Guatemala started commercial production in January. The Reno, Nevada-based company\u2019s cash balance jumped more than eightfold in the first three quarters of 2014. It announced its first dividend payment in November. The enlarged company will have no net debt and its market capitalization will appeal to a larger group of institutional investors, attract more coverage from analysts and improve share trading liquidity, Tahoe and Rio Alto said. \u201cThe combination would arguably create an intermediate multi-mine producer with low production costs, a strong balance sheet with net cash, and with a genuine growth profile,\u201d said Daniel Earle, a Toronto-based analyst at TD Securities Inc. Rio Alto Chief Executive Officer Alex Black will lead the combined company while Tahoe CEO Kevin McArthur will become executive chairman. Black\u2019s appointment \u201csignificantly strengthens the management group long term,\u201d Earle said in a note. \u201cBlack has, in our view, established himself as a star in the institutional community with the emergence of Rio Alto.\u201d Investors will get 0.227 of a Tahoe share and 0.1 of a Canadian cent for each Rio Alto share. The deal, which is expected to be completed in early April, includes a C$57.6 million termination fee payable to Tahoe under certain circumstances. Rio Alto rose 11 percent to C$3.65 at the close in Toronto. Tahoe fell 9.3 percent to C$16. The deal is the largest in the gold-mining industry since Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd and Yamana Gold Inc. announced the joint acquisition of Osisko Mining Corp. in April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tahoe\u2019s lead financial adviser was BMO Capital Markets. Raymond James Ltd. and Bank of America Corp. were also financial advisers while Macquarie Group Ltd. and Beacon Securities Ltd. were strategic advisers. Cassels, Brock & Blackwell LLP was Tahoe\u2019s legal adviser.

Davis\u2019s investment vehicle X2 Resources values Vale\u2019s nickel business at $5 billion to $7 billion, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private. There hasn\u2019t been any formal negotiation between X2 and Vale about the assets yet, they said. X2 has raised about $4.8 billion from equity investors including Asia\u2019s largest raw-materials trader Noble Group Ltd., private-equity fund TPG Capital and sovereign-wealth and pension funds to create a mid-tier mining company. It has been hunting for assets to buy from the world\u2019s largest miners such as Vale, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Anglo American Plc. Vale\u2019s American depositary receipts, the equivalent of one ordinary share, dropped 0.6 percent to $8.50 at the close in New York after gaining as much as 2.7 percent. Nickel for delivery in three months fell 3 percent to $14,650 a metric ton in London today, the lowest since Feb. 27. Vale, which is also the world\u2019s leading iron-ore miner, has already said it may try to raise cash by selling some of its assets. The Rio de Janeiro-based company is considering the sale of a minority stake in its metals-producing unit, which it valued at as much as $35 billion, in an initial public offering, Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani said Dec. 2. The unit includes copper as well as nickel. X2 Resources declined to comment, while Vale said it hasn\u2019t received any proposal or held talks with X2 about its nickel assets. Vale\u2019s nickel output will climb to 303,000 metric tons this year while copper is forecast to rise to 449,000 tons, the company said last month. Its base-metals unit is the company\u2019s largest business after iron ore. The Brazilian company produced 201,400 tons of nickel, a metal used in stainless steel, in the first nine months of 2014,   Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin\u2019s OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel as the No. 1 producer of the metal. Norilsk\u2019s nine-month output sank 5.6 percent to 199,800 metric tons from a year earlier. Vale\u2019s base-metals division is targeting $4 billion to $6 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization this year, from $600 million in 2012, as it improves operations and output grows. Since winning a battle to take over Inco Ltd. in 2006, the company has faced a series of setbacks including strikes in Canada, operational problems at plants in Brazil and an acid spill in New Caledonia. The miner can generate as much as $10 billion in cash from potential divestments including selling a minority stake in the base metals business, 15 large vessels and fertilizer assets, Siani said last month. South African-born Davis, 56, is looking to repeat his success at Xstrata, where he led the management team that took the coal producer from a company with a $500 million market capitalization to one valued at $50 billion through a decade of mergers, acquisitions and expansion. Should X2 make an offer, it won\u2019t be the first time Davis has targeted major nickel assets. As CEO of Xstrata, he completed a hostile $18 billion takeover of Canadian nickel miner Falconbridge Ltd. in 2006. Falconbridge and Inco were two of Canada\u2019s largest miners at the time, with adjacent mining areas in Ontario. Vale bought Inco in a $18.2 billion  , with current Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira leading the acquisition at the time as the company\u2019s head of base metals.","timestamp":1421170268.0,"participant_ids":["VALE5:BZ","GLEN:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-13\/ex-xstrata-ceo-davis-considering-a-bid-for-vale-nickel-assets","subject":"Ex-Xstrata CEO Said to Weigh Bid for Vale Nickel Mines"},{"body":" Mick Davis, who built Xstrata Plc into one of the world\u2019s biggest mining companies, is trying to do it again. Davis, a 56-year-old South African, is considering a bid for the nickel business of Vale SA, the world\u2019s top producer, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Davis\u2019s investment vehicle X2 Resources values Vale\u2019s nickel business at $5 billion to $7 billion, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private. Through a decade of 40 mergers and expansions, the onetime cricket umpire Davis increased Xstrata\u2019s market value more than 80 times to $50 billion, and became the world\u2019s biggest exporter of power-station coal. After it agreed to be acquired in 2012 by its largest shareholder Glencore International Plc in a $30 billion deal, Davis was to lead the combined company. The power-sharing agreement collapsed when Glencore Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg demanded the title. Davis\u2019s X2 has since raised about $4.8 billion from equity investors and has been hunting for assets to buy from the world\u2019s largest miners such as Vale, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Anglo American Plc. \u201cMick Davis is a strong and a driven individual who has been very successful,\u201d said Vince Gauci, who was managing director of M.I.M. Holdings Ltd. when Xstrata acquired the Australian metals and coal producer for $3 billion in 2003. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt that he\u2019s still got the fire in his belly to start again.\u201d X2 declined to comment on the potential bid. Rio-based Vale said it hasn\u2019t received any proposal or held talks with X2 about its nickel assets. Vale has already said it may try to raise cash by selling some of its assets. A successful deal for the Vale assets could mean a return not only for Davis but also for more private-equity investments in mining, according to Ken Hoffman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. While buyout funds are flush with capital, they\u2019ve struggled to land deals as commodity prices declined. \u201cI think he really wants to prove to the world that Xstrata wasn\u2019t a fluke, that he can do this all over again,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cIf he comes out and does a great deal, I think it\u2019s good for all the rest of these guys.\u201d Davis grew up in South Africa\u2019s Eastern Cape, where he became the country\u2019s youngest qualified cricket umpire. He graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree from Rhodes University, before becoming an accountant. He landed at South African miner Gencor Ltd. in 1994, helping to turn it into what became Billiton Plc. Davis left to join Xstrata in 2001 when Billiton was bought by BHP Ltd. At Xstrata, Davis created a diversified mining company, riding a boom in metals prices as Chinese economic growth fueled what became known as the commodities supercycle. He completed deals with a total value of $33.6 billion. The biggest takeover was its $18 billion acquisition of Falconbridge Ltd. in Canada, the largest successful hostile bid in mining, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By the time Glencore made its bid, Xstrata had sales of $33.9 billion in 2011 and more than 70,000 employees in 20 countries, compared with fewer than 2,500 when Davis joined. He was set to become CEO of the combined Glencore-Xstrata company until Glasenberg raised his bid and demanded that he lead the company. Davis was paid 4.63 million pounds ($7 million) after terminating the agreement. Davis\u2019s financial backers include Asia\u2019s largest raw-materials trader Noble Group Ltd., private-equity fund TPG Capital and sovereign-wealth and pension funds. Should X2 make an offer, it won\u2019t be the first time Davis has targeted major nickel assets. Falconbridge was one of the world\u2019s largest producer of the metal when it was acquired in 2006. Falconbridge\u2019s big Canadian rival at the time was Inco Ltd., the nickel producer that Vale bought for $18.2 billion in 2007. Eight years later, Davis is considering a bid for the former Inco assets. \u201cWe all know that when commodity prices are low, some people don\u2019t have the capacity or courage to buy assets because they are afraid of the doom and gloom,\u201d said Gauci, who\u2019s now a director of Newcrest Mining Ltd. \u201cThe fact that Mick has been able to get good support from the investment community means he\u2019s got access to cash which he\u2019s prepared to use when the cycle is at a low point.\u201d","timestamp":1421189063.0,"participant_ids":["GLEN:LN","VALE5:BZ","BHP:AU"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-14\/ex-xstrata-ceo-seeks-second-act-as-he-considers-vale-bid","subject":"Ex-Xstrata CEO Seeks Second Act as He Considers Vale Bid"},{"body":"From 2010 to 2012, Honda Motor Co. said it made multiple attempts to notify the owner of a 2001 Accord that the car\u2019s air bag was faulty and needed replacing. Last July, with the car sold to another person and repairs still uncompleted, the vehicle crashed in Pennsylvania and the Takata Corp. air bag shattered, fatally injuring the driver, a minor whose name was not released, according to a U.S. auto-safety agency. The day before the accident, Honda had mailed the new owner yet another recall notice. The latest fatality linked to a Takata air bag -- eight have occurred in the U.S. and one outside the country, with about 100 people injured -- highlights a flawed recall system that all too often fails to lead to critical repairs and can take years to complete, according to lawmakers and auto-safety advocates. Meanwhile, cars can be legally sold and registered without recall fixes having to be performed. \u201cThe identification of yet another preventable death -- this time a young boy and well after when this safety defect was first made known -- reiterates the urgent need for swift recall of all cars with these potentially defective airbags,\u201d Senators Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a joint  .   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced on Wednesday the latest death suspected of resulting from air bags that can spray drivers and passengers with shrapnel. The agency also said the pace of recalls had picked up to about 2 million per month. With almost three-quarters of the 19 million vehicles under the recall still unrepaired, the fixes could still take another seven more months to complete. And that may be optimistic, based on the rate of repairs in previous recalls. On average, only about 70 percent of vehicles covered under recalls are repaired, said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based advocacy group. The rate for older vehicles such as those involved in the Takata recall is much lower, about 50 to 60 percent, Ditlow said. \u201cNot every single owner shows up the first day to get it fixed,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people will fit it in with their next trip for service or when they have time in their schedule. You have to get a sense of urgency in the consumer.\u201d NHTSA has expanded its recall to include\u00a0additional models made by Subaru Co., Mazda Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., and appointed an independent monitor to oversee Takata\u2019s response, spokesman Gordon Trowbridge said Wednesday. \u201cThis young person\u2019s death is tragic and it underscores why we are continuing to work so hard to get these defective deflators off the road,\u201d Trowbridge said. \u201cDespite the unprecedented publicity surrounding these recalls, there are still vehicles under recall with parts available for repairs that have not been fixed.\u201d Honda, in a statement, said it was investigating the crash in Pennsylvania and urged car owners to get their recalled vehicles repaired as soon as possible. \u201cOur thoughts and sincere sympathies are with the family,\u201d the company said. Neither NHTSA nor Honda identified the victim. Takata, in an e-mailed statement, also extended condolences to the driver\u2019s family. \u201cWe are working in close collaboration with Honda and NHTSA to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding this tragic situation,\u201d the company said. \u201cTakata\u2019s number one priority is the safety of the driving public.\u201d The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said in an e-mail it was closed for the holidays and couldn\u2019t respond to questions about the recall process. Takata reached a   spanning five years with NHTSA on Nov. 3, agreeing to pay fines of $70 million, fire some employees and phase out the chemical explosive linked to the failures. If the company doesn\u2019t meet its terms, it will be subject to additional fines of as much as $130 million, which would total the largest civil penalty in NHTSA\u2019s history. The consent decree included installing an independent monitor, to be paid for by Takata. John D. Buretta,\u00a0a partner with the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and former principal deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice Criminal Division, has been selected for the job, Trowbridge said. Burretta previously served as the chief of the organized crime and racketeering section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of New York, and on its national security unit. In 10 years with the Department of Justice he held a number of roles, including chief of staff and director of the agency\u2019s Deepwater Horizon Task Force, which handled BP Plc\u2019s 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. \u201cThe independent monitor has a steep uphill climb to figure this out,\u201d Ditlow said. \u201cPeople are dying.\u201d The senators said the pace of the Takata recall \u201cis completely unacceptable and a massive disappointment.\u201d Automakers dragged their feet and didn\u2019t report the extent of the risks swiftly enough, and NHTSA moved too slowly after it began receiving reports, they said. NHTSA has taken steps to speed up the recall, such as including deadlines for action in its consent order with the company, Trowbridge said. For example, manufacturers in states with high humidity, which has been linked to the air bag failures, must have enough parts on hand by March to complete all repairs, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got kind of a mess on our hands here and everybody acknowledges this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not going to get done fast enough to satisfy us or, frankly, we think the manufacturers that are involved.\u201d Law changes that would make recall completion rates higher have consistently been fought by the industry, Ditlow said. A measure contained in transportation legislation earlier this year would have required used car dealers to perform all outstanding recalls before selling vehicles. It was taken out of the bill before it passed. NHTSA also could push suppliers harder to make replacement parts available, Ditlow said. Some auto manufacturers have told customers they won\u2019t be able to repair air bags on certain vehicles until the middle of 2016, Ditlow said. \u201cAre parts available for every single Takata recall? The answer to that clearly is no,\u201d he said. Motorists can check to see if their vehicles are on the recall list at a NHTSA-run website,  . Repairs under the recall are free.","timestamp":1450880614.0,"participant_ids":["7312:JP","0833875D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-23\/eighth-u-s-motorist-death-linked-to-faulty-takata-airbags","subject":"New Air Bag Death Said to Show Flaws in U.S. Recall System"},{"body":"The world\u2019s biggest iron ore miners have accumulated an unprecedented amount of pricing power after boosting market share, according to Morgan Stanley, which said they may now have an incentive to use the new-found clout by curbing supply to spur a rally. The four largest producers have expanded their combined share of global supply to 75 percent after they raised low-cost output and smaller rivals quit, the bank said in a report received on Monday. Brazil\u2019s Vale SA may slow the ramp-up of its S11D project, while Australia\u2019s BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group could delay growth or cut production, it said. Iron ore has sunk 45 percent this year, dropping below $40 last week, as producers including Vale, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto pressed on with expansions to defend market share. While\u00a0boosting output as quickly as possible was the most rational approach for the top miners\u00a0over the last decade, they may now need new strategies after the market weakened, Morgan Stanley said. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed to buoy the ore price? Vale, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton to end their competitive supply surge and act more rationally in this weakened market,\u201d analysts Tom Price and Joel Crane wrote. \u201cVale\u2019s the last to deliver big tons to the market: if a moderation of its supply-growth strategy is followed by the Australians, this will secure a price above that of market expectations.\u201d Ore with 62 percent content delivered to Qingdao dropped 4.3 percent last week to $38.30 a dry ton on Friday, a record low in daily prices compiled by Metal Bulletin Ltd. going back to May 2009. The price was at $39.06 on Monday. BHP spokeswoman Emily Perry said in an e-mail that the miner\u2019s strategy was unchanged, and noted \u201cnumerous on-the-record comments from us in relation to the \u2018market\u2019 setting the price.\u201d The e-mail cited a comment in June from Jimmy Wilson, BHP\u2019s iron ore president, that BHP\u2019s share of the seaborne market has remained at about 17 percent. \u201cWe have not altered our guidance,\u201d Rio said in an e-mail, adding that the company\u2019s market share was stable at about 20 percent. \u201cWe will add less than 20 million tons over the next two years to a global market expected to be around 1.4 billion tons a year. That represents less than 2 percent.\u201d \u201cMost in the market are transfixed on the ore price\u2019s collapse, convinced that the passing of the commodity boom has permanently crushed the value in this trade,\u201d the bank said. \u201cHowever, the price fall has also prompted the closure of high-cost production worldwide, including in China. Indeed, this market structure is evolving rapidly into one of the most highly consolidated trades.\u201d In March, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. Chairman Andrew Forrest called for the major miners to cap output to revive prices. The proposal was rejected by rivals, including Rio Chief Executive Officer Sam Walsh, who said the idea was nonsense\u00a0as it \u201cwon\u2019t help us in the longer term to prop up projects that are actually not competitive.\u201d Iron ore remains above the levels seen in recent decades. The raw material went as low as $10.51 a ton in 1988, when annual contracts were negotiated between the largest miners and some steel mills, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. Morgan Stanley said while\u00a0top producers had a similar share of global supply during the annual benchmark era before 2005, the demand-side was even more consolidated at that time as only the top mills in Japan and Korea represented all Asian suppliers. Since then, China\u2019s entry distorted the consumer-side and the major miners now possess an unprecedented level of pricing power, it said. \u201cAt current price levels, the incentive exists for them to exercise it,\u201d the bank said.","timestamp":1450053055.0,"participant_ids":["BHP:AU","VALE5:BZ"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-14\/iron-majors-seen-with-unprecedented-pricing-power-to-stem-rout","subject":"Iron Majors Seen With `Unprecedented' Pricing Power to Stem Rout"},{"body":" A former hedge fund analyst who played a crucial role helping the U.S. build insider-trading cases tied to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam and SAC Capital Advisors LP was spared prison after prosecutors cited his \u201cextraordinary\u201d cooperation. Thomas Hardin, 37, spent more than six years working with Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, even before hiring a lawyer or getting a formal cooperation agreement with the U.S. Prosecutors said he \u201cconsistently provided quality information that contributed in significant part to dozens of insider-trading convictions\u201d that led to at least 20 people being charged by the U.S. \u201cThe past six years have been the most shameful and most difficult of my life,\u201d Hardin told U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan Wednesday before she announced his sentence. \u201cThe actions that brought me here today were selfish and inexcusable,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cI am deeply sorry for the mistakes I\u2019ve made and I am deeply humbled and ashamed. I hope your honor can see that I\u2019ve left my old life behind.\u201d Hardin, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business, was an analyst at Lanexa Global Management LP when agents asked him in July 2008 to secretly record conversations with friends and colleagues engaged in illegal trading, Larry Krantz, Hardin\u2019s lawyer, said in court papers. Before he was publicly identified, Hardin became known as \u201cTipper X\u201d for his role as the link between insider rings at Galleon and Schottenfeld Group LLC. Swain cited Hardin\u2019s aid in building cases for the U.S. as a reason for sparing him from prison. She noted that Hardin lost his job and was barred from the securities industry as a result of the case. \u201cHis reaction has had profound implications for law enforcement,\u201d the judge said. \u201cHis conviction alone and the course of his life in the past six years should serve as a firm deterrent message to others who are tempted to take the path to illegality.\u201d Swain ordered Hardin to forfeit $46,743 and said she wouldn\u2019t impose any fine. Hardin was a friend of Roomy Khan, the former Intel Corp. executive who was a key government witness against Rajaratnam, prosecutors said. After Khan agreed to secretly cooperate with the U.S. against Rajaratnam in late 2007, prosecutors said Hardin provided evidence that showed Khan was lying to agents and obstructing federal investigations, according to the U.S. Hardin described getting nonpublic information from Gautham Shankar, a former Schottenfeld trader, which led the FBI to former Galleon trader Zvi Goffer and a separate insider-trading ring, according to the government. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison term after being convicted of insider trading while Goffer was imprisoned in 2011 for trading on tips leaked by lawyers. Hardin also provided the U.S. with information about crimes committed by Wesley Wang, who worked at SAC Capital\u2019s Sigma Capital unit, both Krantz and prosecutors said. Hardin\u2019s cooperation led to cases against Wang and at least three others, the lawyers said. Wang pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the U.S. Krantz said Hardin helped agents develop leads about Galleon and SAC Capital. He also explained how Primary Global Research, an expert-networking firm, allowed technology company employees moonlighting for PGR to pass tips to hedge funds for a fee. Hardin agreed to secretly record telephone calls and conversations he had with Khan and Wang, prosecutors said. \u201cWithout Hardin\u2019s cooperation (which led to the development of other cooperating witnesses), the government may have never uncovered the expert insider-trading ring network that led to 20 convictions alone,\u201d prosecutor Parvin Moyne said in a letter to the court. At least five former PGR employees or consultants who Hardin provided information about later agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with the U.S., Krantz said. The case is U.S. v. Hardin, 10-cr-00399, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).","timestamp":1424892575.0,"participant_ids":["2647380Z:US","615068Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-25\/galleon-sac-cooperator-spared-prison-at-insider-sentencing-i6l8jex8","subject":"Galleon, SAC Cooperator Spared Prison at Insider Sentencing"},{"body":" The FBI\u2019s warrant for a 2010 raid on Level Global Investors LP in an insider-trading probe was unsealed as one of its founders sued prosecutors over claims the search was illegal and caused the hedge fund\u2019s demise. David Ganek, who co-founded Level Global with Anthony Chiasson after they left SAC Capital Advisors LP, said in a complaint filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court that the government violated his rights in the investigation knowing he was innocent. Ganek claims the Federal Bureau of Investigation and prosecutors fabricated evidence against him and ignored the \u201ccatastrophic risk\u201d that news of the November 2010 search would cause. Level Global closed the following February. Chiasson was convicted after a 2012 trial while Spyridon \u201cSam\u201d Adondakis, his analyst, pleaded guilty to insider trading and cooperated with the U.S. Ganek\u2019s suit came hours after the warrant and affidavit used to search Level Global\u2019s Midtown Manhattan offices were unsealed by U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. Requests to make public warrants used to search three other hedge funds in November 2010 remain pending. A manila folder labeled \u201cSAC\u201d and \u201ccorrespondence\u201d was seized by FBI agents during the raid, which was part of an insider-trading probe involving expert-networking firms. The FBI also obtained binders, computer hard drives, mobile phones, notebooks and writing pads. The U.S. used the warrants to obtain evidence in the prosecution of Chiasson and Todd Newman, a fund manager with Diamondback Capital Management LLC. The unsealed documents show that Chiasson and Adondakis were captured on secret FBI wiretaps in 2009 and 2010. The locations of the wiretaps weren\u2019t disclosed in a redacted copy of the filing. During a 2012 trial of Chiasson and Newman, Sullivan ruled Ganek was an uncharged co-conspirator in the insider-trading scheme with both men. In a December 2012 letter to Sullivan, prosecutors said an inference could be drawn that Ganek \u201cknew or consciously avoided knowing\u201d that Adondakis was getting nonpublic information from inside companies. \u201cThe representations about David Ganek in the affidavit were false, and the government knows that,\u201d Nancy Gertner, an attorney for Ganek, said Thursday in an e-mailed statement. \u201cDavid Ganek was not charged after a substantial investigation because he did nothing wrong.\u201d Ganek, who said in his complaint that he was unable to see the sealed search warrant until March 2012, wasn\u2019t charged by prosecutors or sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He alleges the government violated his rights against unreasonable search and due process of law, and seeks unspecified damages. \u201cDefendants had no probable cause to believe Mr. Ganek had engaged in any wrongdoing,\u201d he said in his complaint against FBI officials in New York, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and other top prosecutors. The FBI searches occurred during a nationwide crackdown on insider trading in which more than 80 people were convicted. Diamondback and two other hedge funds were also searched by the FBI in November 2010. Evidence against Chiasson included an FBI wiretap of conversations on the mobile phone of John Kinnucan, an expert-networker who mocked the government\u2019s insider-trading probe just before the 2010 searches. Agents said Kinnucan provided Chiasson with nonpublic information from his sources at companies, including Apple Inc. Chiasson questioned Kinnucan whether he did his own research or relied instead on \u201crumor.\u201d \u201cKinnucan told Chiasson that he wanted to be very clear that he did not traffic in \u2018second hand and rumors,\u2019 that he does not repeat stuff that he heard, and that he only traffics in stuff that he has heard from \u2018my primary contacts,\u2019\u201d according to an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Holly Trask. Kinnucan was later charged, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison. The U.S. didn\u2019t use any evidence pertaining to Kinnucan at Chiasson\u2019s trial. A federal appeals court overturned Chiasson\u2019s and Newman\u2019s convictions in December. The court said jurors weren\u2019t told that to find the two guilty, prosecutors had to show they knew the tip came from someone who not only knew it was secret, but got something for leaking it. After Level Global\u2019s collapse, Ganek, an art collector, set up a fund, Apocalypse 22 LLC, to manage his own money. The day Chiasson\u2019s conviction was thrown out, Ganek called the ruling a \u201clegal vindication\u201d and \u201ca reminder how prosecutorial recklessness has real impact on real people.\u201d , a lawyer for Chiasson, declined to comment on the warrants. Matt Benson, a spokesman for Chiasson at Sard Verbinnen & Co., also declined to comment on the documents, as well as Ganek\u2019s lawsuit. Nine people, including Chiasson and Newman, were convicted of trading on inside tips about Dell Inc. and two other technology firms. The group included five men who were part of a group of hedge fund analysts who called themselves the \u201cFight Club.\u201d Their cases are on hold after prosecutors asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York to reconsider its ruling on Chiasson and Newman. The U.S. argues that the ruling weakens its ability to police illicit activity and conflicts with the court\u2019s prior insider-trading decisions. Michael Steinberg, a former SAC fund manager, was convicted of trading on the same tips as Newman and Chiasson. His appeal is pending. Eight fund managers and analysts who had worked at SAC were convicted of illegal trading. Steven A. Cohen, SAC\u2019s founder, wasn\u2019t charged with any wrongdoing. In April 2013, a federal judge ordered Level Global to pay more than $21.5 million as part of a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The appeals case is U.S. v. Newman, 13-1917, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). The lower-court case is U.S. v. Newman, 12-cr-121, U.S District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Authorities have said they are investigating whether financial institutions allowed the processing of suspicious or otherwise improper transactions or failed to observe anti-money laundering laws in their dealings with FIFA, the bank said Friday in its financial report for the third quarter. Credit Suisse said is cooperating with the authorities. The banks are an obvious line of inquiry for prosecutors but proving they knew of any wrongdoing would be tougher given that Zurich-based FIFA is an established global body, said Dieter Hein, a financial analyst at Fairesearch GmbH & Co, in Kronberg, Germany. \u201cIf there was money laundering, sure, you have to look at the banks,\u201d Hein said in a telephone interview. \u201cHow\u2019s the bank supposed to know this is money laundering, if the money comes from a hitherto reputable organization?\u201d The scandal has spread in recent weeks with the Swiss Attorney-General opening criminal proceedings into FIFA President Sepp Blatter over a 2 million-franc ($2 million) payment he made to European soccer chief Michel Platini. Both men have said they did nothing illegal but have been suspended by FIFA for 90 days. The affair was sparked by the arrest in May of seven soccer officials in Zurich on the eve of FIFA\u2019s congress at the request of U.S. prosecutors, who indicted the men and seven others on charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering. Credit Suisse is flagging its role in the expanding FIFA investigations less than two years after it pleaded guilty to aiding tax evasion in the U.S. Several banks, including Julius Baer Group Ltd., started internal investigations after the U.S. Justice Department named them in the May indictment. Standard Chartered Plc, based in London, is looking into two payments it cleared that were mentioned in the FIFA indictment, it said on May 31. HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc are also studying transactions to ensure proper procedures were followed, the Sunday Times reported in May, citing people it didn\u2019t identify. No one at the Swiss Attorney General\u2019s office was immediately available to confirm that it was the Swiss government agency leading the investigation into the Credit Suisse client relationships. Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber said in June that banks had announced 53 suspicious banking relations under anti-money laundering rules\u00a0at lenders located in Switzerland. Prosecutors also learned separately of 104 banking relations and seized data for the investigation, Lauber said at the time. Serge Steiner, a spokesman for UBS Group AG, declined to comment on whether investigators have questioned any dealings it might have had with FIFA.

Cutler will be replaced by Garvis Toler III, an executive from Dealogic, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which acquired NYSE Group Inc. in 2013, said in a statement today. Toler will become global head of capital markets. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. set records in September when it raised $25 billion. Under Cutler\u2019s watch, NYSE dramatically increased its share of Internet and technology listings, and in 2013 won more debuts in the sector than Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. for the first time. Cutler was one of the few remaining NYSE executives whose role predated ICE\u2019s acquisition. Another NYSE listings executive John Merrell will be responsible for listed company relationships, according to Tuesday\u2019s statement. Since ICE took over the Big Board operator NYSE has seen the departures of much of its former leadership, including Chief Executive Officer Duncan Niederauer, Chief Operating Officer Larry Leibowitz, head of U.S. equities Joe Mecane and Lou Pastina, who oversaw the New York Stock Exchange. ICE CEO Jeff Sprecher tapped one of his top deputies, Tom Farley, to run NYSE Group. The exchange operator has also promoted internally, with Paul Adcock taking on day-to-day operations of the U.S. stock exchanges. Other changes included Steve Crutchfield, the head of U.S. options, gaining oversight over exchange-traded funds and bonds and Elizabeth King becoming the new general counsel at NYSE. Cutler joined NYSE in 2006, hired from Cowen & Co. by then-CEO John Thain. One of Cutler\u2019s first moves was to push for a change to NYSE\u2019s listing requirements. In 2008, the exchange lowered the threshold for the size of listed companies to $150 million from $250 million, and removed a requirement that a company had to be profitable for three straight years. The changes meant that 70 percent of companies looking to go public could qualify for a NYSE listing, compared with 30 percent under the previous rules, Cutler said in an interview last summer. Among his initiatives, Cutler began establishing relationships in the technology world, holding boot camps with startups where executives of companies considering going public are instructed on the nuances of an IPO. \u201cYou\u2019re not flying in pinstripe suits from New York to win business,\u201d he recalled telling Thain. \u201cYou have to be part of the community and you have to be relevant.\u201d","timestamp":1425409861.0,"participant_ids":["9892043Z:US","ICE:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-03\/nyse-listings-chief-scott-cutler-departing-in-latest-shuffle","subject":"NYSE Listings Chief Scott Cutler Departing in Latest Shuffle"},{"body":"David Cassidy, who correctly told investors to shun Australian mining stocks in 2015, says the worst is yet to come for the industry as China\u2019s economy decelerates. Investors should hold fewer commodity producers than are represented in the S&P\/ASX 200 Index because shares are yet to bottom, says Cassidy, UBS Group AG\u2019s head of equity strategy for Australia. Instead of speculating on some of the\u00a0stock market\u2019s worst performers, he\u2019s telling investors to buy firms with profits that are closely tied to an upswing in the economy, such as developer LendLease Group and retailer Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd. \u201cWe\u2019re closer to the bottom but not yet willing to call the bottom here,\u201d Cassidy said in a phone interview from Sydney on Dec. 14. \u201cChina is still likely to slow into 2016 while at the same time we are likely to see supply increases, particularly for iron ore. Slowing demand and increasing supply gives us a bearish setup.\u201d A 25 percent plunge by Australian materials shares has put the nation\u2019s benchmark equity measure on course for its first annual decline since 2011. BHP Billiton Ltd. is trading near a decade-low and Rio Tinto Group is down 27 percent this year as analysts cut dividend forecasts and global peers from Anglo American Plc to Freeport-McMoRan Inc. shrink their businesses. BHP has slumped 36 percent since Cassidy said in January that investors should hold an underweight position in mining stocks in 2015, citing downside risk to iron-ore price forecasts. He also accurately favored shares that earn revenue outside Australia, such as Aristocrat Leisure Ltd., and picked consumer staples to underperform. Still, not all of Cassidy\u2019s calls were right -- he liked energy stocks, which have turned out to be the worst-performing industry group, and forecast the ASX 200 to finish the year at 5,700. It closed Wednesday at 5,028.40, 2.4 percent higher, led by a rally in energy shares. All the 18 analysts tracked by Bloomberg with target prices on BHP expect gains from current levels, including Cassidy\u2019s UBS colleague Glyn Lawcock, the firm\u2019s mining analyst. He has buy recommendations on the stock and on Rio Tinto. Cassidy said their views diverge because Lawcock\u2019s ratings are based on commodity-price forecasts that in turn generate earnings estimates and long-term valuations. \u201cI have the licence to take a more tactical view on the risks around those commodity forecasts,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cMost people\u2019s medium to long term commodity prices forecasts are well above where spot prices are. So a lot of stocks will be coming up as buys, albeit the question is when do prices turn. From a strategy perspective you\u2019re looking for catalysts, rather than just saying they\u2019ll turn one day.\u201d Cassidy\u2019s not the only skeptic, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also advising an underweight status on Australian resources shares. Rio Tinto and BHP are still vowing to pay higher dividends each year, a policy viewed by some analysts as unsustainable given the ups and downs of the industry. \u201cValuations are closer to fair, but we worry about the value-destructive behavior that firms may engage in to maintain dividends in the face of collapsing earnings,\u201d Matthew Ross, a Melbourne-based strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report Dec. 11. UBS\u2019s Cassidy now recommends companies with earnings closely tied to a pickup in economic growth, and those that benefit from a weaker Aussie dollar. He advises buying CSL Ltd.,\u00a0a maker of blood-based drugs and vaccines that gets 39 percent of sales in the U.S., and LendLease, a property manager. Harvey Norman, which sells everything from televisions to furniture, is up 14 percent this year. \u201cEconomic data has been printing quite reasonably compared to what the bears were expecting in recent weeks,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThe market is too bearish on the economy.\u201d Australian employers added 71,400 jobs in November, confounding economist forecasts for a 10,000 decline. The report adds to impetus in housing construction and tourism as the nation\u2019s economy moves on from a decade-long mining investment boom. The Bloomberg Commodity Index tumbled 26 percent this year, on course for its biggest annual loss since 2008. Australian materials firms now comprise 12 percent of the S&P\/ASX 200 index, the lowest proportion on record, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with 4.3 percent of the MSCI World Index. Investors \u201care looking for that holy grail of the bottom and when to invest,\u201d said Cassidy. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say exactly when we\u2019re going to reach that level but my concern is we\u2019re not there yet.\"","timestamp":1450217927.0,"participant_ids":["UBSG:VX","BHP:AU"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-16\/ubs-analyst-who-called-mining-stock-slump-sees-rout-deepening","subject":"UBS Analyst Who Called Mining Stock Slump Says Rout Not Over"},{"body":"BHP Billiton Ltd.\u2019s decade-old pledge to continually raise its dividend is looking increasingly unsustainable after Moody\u2019s Investors Service put its credit rating on review for possible downgrade, citing the probability of weak commodity prices persisting for years. This will significantly reduce the world\u2019s biggest mining company\u2019s \u201cearnings and cash flow generation,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in the statement Friday. In the \u201cunlikely\u201d event that BHP takes no countermeasures, the A1 rating the company has held since 2004 is likely to be cut, Moody\u2019s said. A spokesman for Melbourne-based BHP declined to comment. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly scope for them to cut capex and there\u2019s certainly scope to cut the dividend,\u201d Richard Knights of Liberum Capital Ltd. in London, the top ranked analyst covering BHP according to Bloomberg data, said by phone. \u201cProgressive dividends are absolutely gone in the sector. The market is already telling you that the dividend is going to be cut.\u201d The worst rout in commodities since the global financial crisis has forced most major companies other than BHP and rival Rio Tinto Group to scrap or pare back payouts to investors. Anglo American Plc, a London-based miner of copper, iron ore and diamonds, last week scrapped all payouts through to 2017 to help shield its balance sheet from a downturn that\u2019s forcing mine closures and pushing smaller producers into bankruptcy. BHP shares rose 1.3 percent by 10:57 a.m. in London, after earlier this week touching the lowest since 2005. The company\u2019s dividend yield is about 13 percent, after paying out $6.6 billion to investors for the year ended June 30. Moody\u2019s cited BHP\u2019s progressive dividend policy, in place since 2003, and its forecast spending levels as the two key reasons why the company\u2019s critical debt-to-earnings ratio \u201cwill not return to a more appropriate level for the rating over the next several years.\u201d Moody\u2019s said its review will focus on \u201cthe potentially very significant countermeasures the company is able to employ -- and the willingness to employ such measures -- to protect its credit metrics in the lower price environment,\u201d Matthew Moore, a Moody\u2019s vice president and senior credit officer, said in the statement. \u201cSpecifically Moody\u2019s will be reviewing the company\u2019s ability to further reduce operating costs and capital expenditures, as well as its ability and willingness to reduce its ongoing dividends.\u201d Commodity prices have fallen to the lowest in 16 years as China\u2019s economic slowdown curbed demand after years of heavy investment in new production. S&P affirmed its A+ rating on BHP in November with a negative outlook. That reflected the continued weakness and volatility in commodities affecting its earnings and key credit metrics, it said. BHP Chairman Jac Nasser told investors at the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Perth in November that a decision on the dividend will be made in February, prior to its first-half results announcement. He said the strength of the company\u2019s balance sheet must be the main priority. \u201cManagement have made it clear that the solid A credit rating is a priority, not the dividend,\u201d Liberum\u2019s Knights said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of self-help that they can deliver.

Turquoise Hill, a unit of Rio Tinto Group, agreed the sale to China-based Novel Sunrise Investments Ltd. for about C$17 million ($13.5 million) in cash, the Vancouver-based company said yesterday in a statement. That\u2019s a 31 percent discount to SouthGobi\u2019s closing price Monday. SouthGobi, operator of the Ovoot Tolgoi coal mine, has drawn scrutiny after three former employees were convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to between five and six years in prison. SouthGobi was ordered to pay a fine of 35 billion tugrik ($18 million) and is appealing the ruling which it has said represents \u201ca gross miscarriage of justice.\u201d As recently as 2010, SouthGobi, whose main market is China, was valued at almost $3 billion. Amid a slump in the price of coal and a souring of the investment climate in Mongolia, the company is now worth just over $100 million and has warned that it risks insolvency if the tax verdict stands. In July, Turquoise Hill sold almost 30 percent of the company to a Hong Kong-based buyer for 45.5 Canadian cents a share. Its deal with Novel Sunrise is priced at 35 cents. In a separate statement, SouthGobi said it would raise as much as $7.5 million from Novel Sunrise for working capital. The proceeds will allow SouthGobi to continue to operate as a going concern to the end of April, the company said. The deal \u201cshows the Chinese are not overly concerned with the negative investment environment,\u201d Nick Cousyn, chief operating officer for BDSec, Mongolia\u2019s largest brokerage, said by phone today. \u201cThe Chinese remain very interested in Mongolian coal and this investment will likely allow SouthGobi production to come back on line.\u201d Novel Sunrise declined to comment on the purchase. Turquoise Hill rose 1.1 percent to close at C$3.79 in Toronto, while SouthGobi climbed 9.8 percent to 56 Canadian cents.

And for the winners of this intensifying global turf war, foreign listings have become a key source of growth in an industry that\u2019s being buffeted by a slowdown in trading revenue as more transactions move away from exchanges. \u201cInternational IPOs have increased in importance and in prominence,\u201d said Tom Farley, the president of NYSE Group Inc., the division of Intercontinental Exchange Inc. \u201cNo question.\u201d Even as the recent turmoil in financial markets slowed IPO demand, exchanges haven\u2019t stopped scouting for companies around the world for potential new listings. Apart from the obvious bragging rights, a public company\u2019s annual listing fees generate steady income, which are immune to the ups and downs of trading. At NYSE, revenue from listings rose 12 percent in the second quarter, four times the increase of its trading business and double the overall growth at ICE, its parent. The same pattern is evident at Nasdaq Inc., where listings revenue outstripped growth at its market services unit, which includes trading. NYSE and Nasdaq also increased the recurring fees they charge to companies listed on their venues this year, a clear indication of why exchanges are focusing on that part of the business, according to Ashley Serrao, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to raise prices if you didn\u2019t have a competitive moat around your business,\u201d Serrao said. \u201cThat in itself to me is the ultimate sign that the listing business is more attractive.\u201d Trading, however, has \u201cbeen commoditized\u201d as costs fall and alternative venues such as dark pools proliferate, he said. Long the gold standard in the U.S., NYSE dominated trading of American equities until the early 2000s. Now, it accounts for less than a quarter of total volume as off-exchange venues have become a popular way to trade stocks. The exchanges with the biggest share of foreign IPOs -- NYSE, Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange -- currently earn about 10 percent to 20 percent of their income from listing fees. A larger slice of that pie is coming from cross-border listings. More than 150 foreign companies debuted on exchanges in New York, London, Hong Kong and Frankfurt last year, raising about $67 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with roughly 70 IPOs valued at about $14 billion in 2012. The surge in foreign listings has outpaced the market for IPOs globally, which has increased about 38 percent in the past two years. The big prize is China. Alibaba remains the undisputed high-water mark, but exchange officials are busily courting Chinese companies large and small. Since 2012, mainland companies have accounted for the majority of foreign IPOs for both NYSE and Nasdaq, data compiled by Bloomberg show. For companies from China and other developing nations,\u00a0there are plenty of reasons to look further afield as globalization accelerates. One is money. Companies can often raise more in deeper, more developed equity markets and attract a broader range of investors. Another is the regulatory environment, which came became an issue this summer when China\u2019s government intervened during the run-up and subsequent collapse of its stock market. Chinese authorities have also quietly quashed attempts of companies from going public at price higher than 23 times earnings, a seemingly arbitrary number that local bankers have said is a way for the government ensure investor demand. Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld in July pointed to such local-market controls as a selling point for his own venue. Still, the chance to poach from other exchanges also increases the risk of getting poached yourself. That\u2019s what happened when NYSE lured Alibaba away from Hong Kong. The Asian exchange tried to fight back by introducing looser shareholder voting rights, but was   by its regulator. \u201cIt\u2019s increased competition, but it\u2019s also increased opportunity,\u201d said Amar Budarapu, the chair of global capital markets at law firm Baker & McKenzie. \u201cYou can go into other jurisdictions and say, \u2018You should list on my exchange.\u201d\u2019 Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, the parent company, said in an e-mailed statement that \u201cHong Kong has attracted numerous listings from overseas and HKEx believes it will continue to do so in the future.\u201d Whatever the outcome, the global battle over IPOs show no signs of abating. \u201cIt\u2019s going to continue to be a part of U.S. markets and listings for, I would expect, decades to come,\u201d said Bob McCooey, Nasdaq\u2019s senior vice president of listing services.","timestamp":1445893201.0,"participant_ids":["LSE:LN","9892043Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-26\/global-ipo-wars-exchanges-wage-all-out-fight-for-next-alibaba","subject":"Stock Exchanges Are Fighting a Global War for Listings"},{"body":" The Swiss National Bank reduced the number of shares it held in Apple Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Johnson & Johnson in the fourth quarter, a U.S. regulatory filing shows.

Eight years later, Chairman Thomas Caldwell is frustrated because he has few exit options. The 140-year-old bourse, now renamed BSE Ltd., and its younger rival, the  , haven\u2019t yet sold shares to the public. Policy makers have long viewed the bourses as public utilities to promote an equity culture in the world\u2019s second-most populous nation rather than as a business. \u201cWe feel a bit like orphans who have got into a government-regulated utility,\u201d Caldwell said in an e-mail. \u201cThere are an awful lot of confusing signals from the regulator and policy makers and it is more like an obfuscation, where everyone keeps pointing fingers at everyone else.\u201d Caldwell isn\u2019t alone. The two exchanges are under pressure from other investors as well, including SAIF Partners, a Hong Kong-based private-equity firm and U.S.-based Norwest Venture Partners. They say an IPO leads to better valuations, corporate governance and provides access to finer technology apart from the cash-out option. The investors aren\u2019t in a hurry for no reason. The NSE, which counts Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Tiger Global Management LLC among its investors, is sitting on a cash pile equivalent to 92 percent of its balance sheet, according to data from SAIF Partners. For BSE, the figure is 82 percent, compared with 3 percent for Intercontinental Exchange Inc., 29 percent for the London Stock Exchange and 14 percent for Deutsche Boerse AG, the data show. Shares of Intercontinental Exchange trade on the New York Stock Exchange, which it oversees. The NSE had an average dividend payout of 23 percent between 2011 and 2015 compared with 94 percent by Singapore Exchange Ltd. and 72 percent by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., according to data from SAIF Partners. \u201cIt is a bit of a hypocrisy if an exchange, while encouraging others to raise capital, improve governance standards and bring in better technology, doesn\u2019t do the same itself,\u201d Caldwell said. His firm has cut its   in the BSE to 3.9 percent, according to the latest data. Christopher Jun, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment when asked if the New York-based investment bank would support a share sale by the NSE. Tiger Global also declined to comment. The government and the market regulator have long debated the impact of listing exchanges amid concerns they will lose control in the event of extreme volatility. State-owned funds hold strategic stakes in the bourses, while the government appoints its nominees to the boards. IFCI Ltd., a state-owned project lender that owns 5.55 percent of NSE, made several   to pare down its stake but only got unattractive offers. Lack of IPO plans have hurt buyer sentiment, IFCI\u2019s managing director Malay Mukherjee had   in May. \u201cListing will lead to transparent price discovery and greater liquidity for existing shareholders,\u201d said Sohil Chand, Mumbai-based managing director at Norwest Venture Partners, which owns 2.11 percent of NSE. \u201cIt will give retail investors an opportunity to participate in a stock that is a great proxy for the Indian growth story.\u201d NSE\u2019s board and management will take the listing process to \u201cits logical conclusion\u201d whenever that happens, Spokesman Arindam Saha said by e-mail. \u201cThe rest is for the regulator and the market to decide,\u201d he said. Ashishkumar Chauhan, chief executive officer of the BSE, declined to comment. The NSE handles about twice the volume of the BSE in the cash segment and has 80 percent share of India\u2019s $33 billion a day stock-derivatives market. If the two exchanges were to sell shares, they could be valued at a combined $5.8 billion, 41 percent more than the valuation reflected in private, negotiated deals, according to estimates by SAIF Partners. MCX Ltd., the nation\u2019s biggest commodity futures bourse, has seen its market value surge 50 percent in the past year to about $854 million. The exchange is 15 percent owned by Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. and counts billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala among its investors. A public offering will force the managements to deliver a better performance and help improve their valuations, Ravi Adusumalli, a San Francisco-based managing partner at SAIF Partners, said in an e-mail. \u201cTransparency in an exchange is vital for a healthy economy,\u201d Adusumalli said, adding he\u2019s \u201ctired\u201d of excuses and delays. India\u2019s policy makers this year revived discussions on allowing bourses to sell shares to the public.

Shares of Vale SA, the biggest producer, sank to the lowest in 12 years. The most expensive operations at the four largest suppliers are on the verge of making losses at rates below $40 a metric ton, said John Kovacs, senior commodities economist at Capital Economics in London, who estimates their break-even levels at $28 to $39, taking into account freight and other costs. While these producers will keep output strong, they\u2019ll be constrained by low prices, he said by e-mail on Monday. Iron ore\u2019s plunge below $40 comes as producers including Vale in Brazil and Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd. in Australia press on with expansions to cut costs and defend market share just as demand from the largest consumer China slows.\u00a0They\u2019re the world\u2019s biggest suppliers along with Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. Prices of the raw material have lost 46 percent this year and have plunged 80 percent from their peak in 2011. \u201cThe big four will find it hard to maintain output at below $40,\u201d Kovacs said in response to questions. \u201cIf prices remain weak, output from the highest-cost mines of the big four will be under pressure.\u201d Ore with 62 percent content delivered to Qingdao sank 1.1 percent to $38.65 a dry ton on Tuesday, a record low in daily prices compiled by Metal Bulletin Ltd. dating back to May 2009. The raw material peaked at $191.70 in 2011. Kovacs said that while rates will stay low over the next year, he doesn\u2019t believe they\u2019ll remain below $40 for a significant length of time. He expects prices to recover slowly because demand won\u2019t fall much further and the biggest miners will find it difficult to keep up output at these levels. Mining company shares retreated on Tuesday.\u00a0Vale fell 5.3 percent to the lowest since 2003 in Sao Paulo trading, taking losses this year to 52 percent. BHP\u00a0declined 5.2 percent in Sydney to the lowest since 2005 and Rio dropped to the lowest in more than six years. UBS Group AG estimates that of the four biggest producers, Fortescue has the highest break-even cost of $40 and\u00a0Vale\u2019s is $34 in terms of ore landed in China with 62 percent content including interest. BHP\u2019s break-even level is $29 and Rio\u2019s $30, the bank\u2019s data show. \u201cThere is not much production outside of the big four that can make money at these levels --\u00a0eventually, we should see the juniors be forced to cut production,\u201d said Jeremy Sussman, a New York-based analyst at Clarksons Platou Securities Inc. \u201cIt can also take some time for uneconomic production to come offline.\u201d The top mining companies have justified their strategy.

The mining company\u2019s $2.25 billion of notes due in 2022 have plummeted 15 percent\u00a0to a record low in the past month as a swoon in iron-ore prices deepens, the latest blow to the Rio de Janeiro-based company. The debt is now trading at an unprecedented discount to the bonds of industry peers BHP Billiton Plc and Rio Tinto Plc, and on Thursday Moody\u2019s Investor Service lowered Vale to its lowest investment-grade rating. Vale, the world\u2019s biggest iron-ore producer, is faring worse than competitors as it spends $6.2 billion to expand production at a time when slowing demand from China has sent metals prices into free fall. Iron-ore sank to the lowest since at least 2009 on Thursday and is now down 80 percent from its 2011 peak.\u00a0Vale has also been roiled by\u00a0an unprecedented disaster last month at a mine run by its joint-venture\u00a0Samarco Mineracao SA and growing aversion to Brazilian assets in the wake of the nation\u2019s political and economic crises. \u201cVale has a little more difficulty hunkering down than the others,\u201d\u00a0Ernie Lalonde, a debt analyst at DBRS Ltd., said by telephone from Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough outlook.\u201d Vale\u2019s press office didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the performance of the company\u2019s bonds.

Vale was lowered one step to Baa3 by Moody\u2019s, with the rating company maintaining a negative outlook, meaning it may be cut again to junk status as low commodity prices weigh on leverage metrics. The company is betting an expansion of its Carajas complex in northern Brazil, its biggest project ever, will trim costs, boost market share and offset the effect of lower prices. The venture is 75 percent complete and will be ready to operate next year, Vale said in October. Still, DBRS\u2019s Lalonde said it might not reach full capacity until 2017, delaying the company\u2019s ability to offset the impact of lower prices with cheaper production of higher-quality ore. \u201cCarajas just took a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are all these things that don\u2019t help the story.\u201d","timestamp":1449792000.0,"participant_ids":["VALE5:BZ","RIO:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-11\/rocked-by-mining-disaster-vale-bondholders-now-hit-by-ore-swoon","subject":"Rocked by Mining Disaster, Vale Bondholders Now Hit by Ore Swoon"},{"body":"Facebook Inc.\u2019s rapid growth to new highs has left yet another stock market stalwart in its wake.

Peabody and Arch Coal Inc., both named in the suit, slumped after the multi-employer pension fund said the two should be liable for at least $767 million associated with a spinoff to Patriot Coal Corp., which filed for bankruptcy in May, court documents show. The suit comes in a bad week for U.S. coal companies. On Thursday, the New York Stock Exchange moved to delist the shares of Alpha Natural Resources Inc. Walter Energy Inc., a steelmaking-coal company, filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. \u201cCoal\u2019s just hit by continued bad headlines on all fronts,\u201d Jeremy Sussman, an analyst at Clarkson Platou Securities Inc. in New York, said by phone Friday. Peabody fell 8.5 percent to a record low $1.29 on the New York Stock Exchange. Arch lost 3 cents, or 10 percent, to 26.5 cents. Both companies\u2019 shares have declined more than 90 percent in the past year. Patriot filed for bankruptcy for the second time in three years citing employee obligations and a drop in coal prices. It\u2019s seeking to sell assets to Blackhawk Mining LLC or find a better bidder at auction in September. That sale would shift the assets \u201cfree and clear\u201d of liabilities. According to the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension plan and its trustees, that includes pension liabilities, which would leave thousands of retired miners in the lurch. The trustees asked a federal judge in Washington on Thursday to force Peabody and Arch into binding arbitration to determine the extent of the companies\u2019 responsibilities as participants in the plan. The coal companies\u2019 so-called withdrawal liability stands at \u201cat least $767 million,\u201d according to the court filing. If the court refuses to compel arbitration, it should declare that the companies have incurred the liability, the trustees said. In an e-mailed statement, Arch said while it has \u201cthe utmost sympathy for the thousands of miners\u201d who have suffered during coal\u2019s slump, \u201cit is absurd to suggest\u201d that the company has the liability obligations. Peabody spokesman Vic Svec didn\u2019t immediately respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment. In a statement on the suit, Peabody said the trustees\u2019 claims \u201care completely without merit.\u201d Patriot consists of unionized units transferred through sale or spinoff to Patriot by Arch and Peabody, including units covered by the pension plan. Francis Lawall, a partner in the Philadelphia office of Pepper Hamilton LLP who concentrates on bankruptcy law, said he sees the suit as a move to get the issue decided outside of bankruptcy court, given conflict between the bankruptcy code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act when it comes to multi-employer pension liability. Unions face a steep challenge in getting courts to find Peabody and Arch liable, said Douglas Blackburn, a lawyer and coal industry analyst in Richmond, Virginia. A bill led by Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, to transfer funds from the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act to pension funds may help address shortfalls if it passes, he said.

The producer of minerals from Australia to Brazil could raise as much as $4.66 billion selling assets in South Africa and Brazil, analysts Marc Elliott and Hunter Hillcoat said. \u201cA disposal of the entire iron ore portfolio would be a game changing transaction, strengthening the balance sheet, reducing the risk profile of the group and potentially enabling a substantial re-rating,\u201d the analysts said in a note. Iron-ore prices reached a decade low of $47 a metric ton on April 2 before rebounding to $59. Investec forecasts prices will average $55 a ton this year before rising to $80 a ton by 2019. Anglo, which owns about 70 percent of Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., Africa\u2019s largest producer of the steel-making raw material, in October began shipments from its Minas-Rio mine in Brazil as prices slid after the largest producers including BHP Billiton Ltd. expanded capacity amid slowing demand from China. \u201cEven in today\u2019s depressed environment, we argue that an exit from iron ore might still offer the best value for Anglo American shareholders,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cThe division presents a risk to the group if iron ore prices slip back.\u201d Anglo could use funds from the sale for dividends and to invest in operations such as copper, Investec said.

For every barrel of oil produced from a well, there\u2019s another seven of water, much of it boiling hot. Instead of letting it go to waste, some companies are planning to harness that heat to make electricity they can sell to the grid. Companies such as Continental Resources Inc. and Hungary\u2019s MOL Group are getting ready to test systems that pump scalding-hot water through equipment that uses the heat to turn electricity-generating turbines before forcing it back underground to coax out more crude. Though the technology has yet to be applied broadly, early results are promising. And if widely adopted, the environmental and financial benefits could be significant. Drillers in the U.S. process 25 billion gallons (95 billion liters) of water annually, enough to generate as much electricity as three coal-fired plants running around the clock -- without carbon emissions. \u201cWe can have distributed power throughout the oil patch,\u201d said Will Gosnold, a researcher at the University of North Dakota who\u2019s leading Continental Resources\u2019 project well. Geothermal power also holds out the promise of boosting frackers\u2019 green credentials after years of criticism for being the industry\u2019s worst polluters, says Lorne Stockman, research director at  , an environmental organization that promotes non-fossil fuel energy. \u201cThis is one way to make it look like the industry cares about the carbon issue,\u201d he said. Even if steam generates less carbon than other oil field power sources, \u201cif you\u2019re in the business of oil and gas, you\u2019re not part of the solution.\u201d Then there\u2019s the money. With crude at less than $50 a barrel, every little bit can help lower costs. At projects like the one being tested by Continental Resources in North Dakota, a 250 kilowatt geothermal generator has the potential to contribute an extra $100,000 annually per well, according to estimates from the  U.S. Energy Department. That\u2019s not big money and the $3.4 million cost to test the technology is still too much to apply to each of Continental\u2019s hundreds of wells. Yet if the company can lower the costs of the technology, it will not only generate electricity it will also extend the economic life of wells, making them more profitable, said Greg Rowe, a production manager with Continental Resources. Continental Resources\u2019s project began with the work of researchers at the University of North Dakota who were looking for ways to use geothermal resources from the thousands of wells being drilled in recent years, spurred on by new horizontal drilling technology. An existing relationship with the university triggered Continental Resources\u2019s interest in the project. The team took off-the-shelf geothermal generators and hooked them to pipes carrying boiling waste water. They\u2019re set to flip the switch any day. When they do, large pumps will drive the steaming water through the generators housed in 40-foot (12-meter) containers, producing electricity that could either be used on site or hooked up to power lines and sold to the electricity grid. To take advantage of plentiful geothermal energy in oil wells, petroleum companies needs to change the way drilling and wells are planned to include the benefits of geothermal energy after most of the fossil fuels have been extracted, said Alison Thompson, chair of the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association and a former engineer at Suncor Energy Inc. \u201cWe don\u2019t value land here the same way that others do,\u201d Thompson said, highlighting projects in Germany and Hungary where geothermal resources are considered part of the total opportunity to earn money from a well. With $50 oil testing producers\u2019 ability to make money, Gosnold is convinced that the idea will pay off if enough water can be pumped through the generators. \u201cThe economics makes a lot of sense over the lifetime of a field,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1429732800.0,"participant_ids":["0073991D:US","CLR:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-22\/turning-bakken-oil-well-waste-water-into-clean-geothermal-power","subject":"Turning Bakken Oil Well Waste Water Into Clean Geothermal Power"},{"body":" Lenders to Arch Coal Inc. are close to picking a replacement for Bank of America Corp., which   last month as their agent bank amid an escalating creditor feud, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Wilmington Trust NA is the top choice to fill the role as an advocate for holders of a $1.9 billion term loan after Bank of America quit when a group of lenders asked it not to sign off on a debt swap, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. The firm hasn\u2019t been hired yet, they said. If Wilmington Trust gets the loan-agent job, it will walk into a   that\u2019s pitting senior lenders against Arch Coal and junior bondholders who would benefit from the debt exchange announced six weeks ago. Arch Coal is attempting to cut debt costs in a bid to weather a commodities slump that\u2019s already pulled three other large U.S. coal miners into bankruptcy this year. Kent Wissinger, a spokesman for Wilmington Trust, and Logan Bonacorsi, a spokeswoman for St. Louis-based Arch Coal, didn\u2019t respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment. Debtwire earlier reported that Wilmington Trust has been hired. The company, which last posted net income in 2011, is seeking through the swap to replace its credit line with one that has less restrictive terms. A third extension of the exchange offer expires Friday at midnight in New York. The senior-lender group, which claims to represent a majority of the holders of the loan, wants to thwart the exchange because it would allow junior creditors to move up in seniority and dilute the senior investors\u2019 claim on assets. The lenders on July 28 directed Bank of America, the agent for the debt at the time, not to grant approval for the proposed swap, Arch coal said in a statement. Bank of America resigned as agent at the end of July, two other people with knowledge of the matter said. Without a loan agent, Arch Coal\u2019s swap has been in limbo. It has had to twice extend the swap offer\u2019s end date since the lenders sent the direction letter to Bank of America. Term-loan holders \u201chave the right, in consultation with\u201d Arch Coal, to select a new term-loan agent, according to the company\u2019s credit agreement. The outgoing agent can choose a new agent if the lenders don\u2019t appoint their own replacement within 30 days after the agent gives notice of its resignation, according to the document. The loan fell less than 0.1 cent to 57.1 cents on the dollar Friday, according to price quotes compiled by Bloomberg. Arch Coal is among a slew of U.S. miners that are struggling amid a plunge in coal prices. Alpha Natural Resources Inc., Walter Energy Inc., Patriot Coal Corp. and James River Coal Co. have filed for   during the past 16 months as the price of coal used in steelmaking dropped 67 percent since 2011.","timestamp":1439558775.0,"participant_ids":["ACI:US","BAC:US","403452Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-14\/arch-coal-lenders-said-to-pick-front-runner-for-agent-bank-role","subject":"Arch Coal Lenders Said to Pick Front-Runner for Agent Role"},{"body":"Mediobanca SpA\u00a0agreed to absorb\u00a0Barclays Plc\u2019s consumer-banking operations in Italy as part of its plan to refocus around retail and investment banking. Barclays, which will record a loss on the disposal, will pay Mediobanca 237 million euros ($259 million) in the transaction to offset the unit\u2019s liabilities, the companies said Thursday. Mediobanca\u2019s CheBanca! unit will gain 89 branches and boost its client base by 40 percent to 770,000. \u201cThis is a transaction consistent with the bank\u2019s plan to allocate capital in business lines that can generate revenue with low capital absorption,\u201d said Gian Luca Sichel, chief executive officer at CheBanca!, in a phone interview. \u201cWe reached a favorable agreement because of Barclays\u2019s commitment to exit the country.\u201d Mediobanca CEO Alberto Nagel is breaking with the strategy of previous decades that saw Italy\u2019s biggest investment bank use stakes in companies to help dominate local dealmaking. After some investments soured following the 2008 financial crisis, Nagel sought to dispose of peripheral assets, focus on corporate and investment banking and expand in retail and asset management. \u201cThis is another positive step in the bank\u2019s transformation from a holding company to an investment and retail bank,\u201d Wolfram Mrowetz, chairman of Alisei Sim, a Milan brokerage, said by phone. \u201cWhile in the investment bank, Mediobanca has long and strong experience, retail is a relatively new business. The main challenge is making CheBanca! a successful brand.\u201d CheBanca! will beat most of the targets set in its three-year plan through June 2016, excluding the Barclays acquisition, which is expected to be completed by then, Sichel said. The unit will report a profit, surpassing its target of breaking even, and will exceed the 4 billion euros targeted for assets under management, he said. Deposits will be in line with the 10 billion-euro goal, he added. CheBanca! will focus on organic growth in the next 12 months, Sichel said, \u201ceven if it will continue to look at opportunities that can arise.\u201d He also expects more of the division\u2019s earnings to come from commission fees. Mediobanca and CheBanca! expect to announce a new plan for their businesses as early as May. CheBanca!\u2019s staff numbers will rise 60 percent to about 1,500. The transaction will give the bank an additional 1 billion euros in risk-weighted assets and absorb about 20 basis points of capital, which will be recovered from earnings growth. It will also add 50,000 wealthier customers. \u201cThe rationalization process may lead to the closure of some branches over the next 12 months, in particular in Rome and Milan, where there is some duplication,\u201d Sichel said. The costs of integrating and rebranding the branches will be covered by Barclays\u2019s payment, he said. Mediobanca, founded in 1946 by Enrico Cuccia and Raffaele Mattioli, sat at the center of Italian finance for more than 50 years, using a web of holdings in the country\u2019s biggest companies to attract clients.  The stock has almost doubled since the new strategy was announced in June 2013. Mediobanca strengthened its investment banking presence abroad and boosted the consumer-credit business and wealth management at CheBanca! In its quarter ended Sept. 30. retail and consumer banking revenue represented more than half of the bank\u2019s total income. \u201cWe view the deal positively, which is a transforming deal for Che Banca! and in line with the group\u2019s growth strategy in the attractive Italian wealth management business,\u201d Anna Maria Benassi, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux with a hold recommendation on the stock, wrote in a report Thursday. Mediobanca has gained 34 percent in in Milan trading this year, compared with a 1.5 percent decline for the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index. Its shares slipped 0.6 percent to 9.04 euros Thursday. At Barclays, CEO Jes Staley is refocusing on the lender\u2019s most profitable businesses in the U.K. and U.S. and selling consumer operations in continental Europe designated as non-core. Britain\u2019s second-largest bank sold its operations in Portugal to Spain\u2019s Bankinter SA for about 100 million euros in September, after CaixaBank SA bought Barclays\u2019s consumer, wealth and investment management and corporate banking operations in Spain for about 800 million euros last year. \u201cThe transaction announced today signals the welcome abandonment of Barclays\u2019s ill-fated foray into Italian retail banking,\u201d said Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec Plc in London. The deal is a step toward \u201cunwinding the disastrous \u2018flag planting\u2019 strategy adopted by Barclays\u2019 retail\/commercial businesses a decade ago.\u201d Barclays said it will continue to be active in corporate and investment banking in Italy. The transaction will result in a loss after tax of about 200 million pounds ($302 million), which will be booked in the fourth quarter of 2015. The bank said its risk-weighted assets will fall by about 800 million pounds. As part of the deal, Mediobanca also bought 2.9 billion euros of residential mortgages. That still leaves Barclays saddled with about 10 billion pounds of Italian home loans it wants to sell from its non-core unit, according to Investec.

Commodities traders are crowing about the money to be made in the bond market. On the cocktail party circuit at the industry\u2019s LME Week earlier this month, at least a dozen traders and executives said that the surest profits these days was in debt issued by their employers and their very own rivals: Glencore Plc, Louis Dreyfus Commodities BV, Trafigura Pte Ltd. and Noble Group Ltd. Take $1.25 billion of Glencore notes maturing this month: the yield surged to a record 32.3 percent on Sept. 29, up from less than 2 percent in early September. Buying $1 million worth of the bond that day may generate in excess of $35,000 in profit in less than four weeks if Glencore repays the notes by maturity on Oct. 23. Bonds got sucked into the same vortex that sent Glencore shares plunging 30 percent in a matter of hours on Sept 28. Even as yields surged, traders said the turmoil hadn\u2019t shaken the backing of the lenders who financed the industry, suggesting the bonds were a safer bet than the markets had priced in. \"The bonds of the trading houses were extremely cheap,\" said Graham Sharp, an adviser to consultants Oliver Wyman & Co. and co-founder of oil and metals trading house Trafigura. \"This was an anomaly.\" While the natural resources industry is battling the worst drop in prices since the global financial crisis, traders -- particularly in oil -- are benefiting from the pick up in price volatility. Not only traders, but the firms themselves have been buying back their own debt. Gunvor Group Ltd. last month completed the repurchase of the commodities trader\u2019s $500 million debut bond. The yield on the notes peaked at more than 14 percent in December after the U.S. imposed sanctions on co-founder Gennady Timchenko. The Russian billionaire sold his stake one day before the sanctions were announced. To be sure, traders have an interest in getting their bond prices higher. Glencore\u2019s longer-dated bonds are still some way from a price commensurate for a company with an investment grade credit rating. For example, its 1.25 billion euro-denominated bonds maturing in 2021 are quoted today at about 77 percent of their face value. That reflects concern about the long-term prospects of the business. Credit-default swaps insuring Glencore\u2019s debt against default within five years surged to a more than six-year high of 882 basis points on Sept. 29 from 300 basis points earlier in the month. The contracts now cost about 649 basis points, according to CMA. The net amount of debt protected increased to $2.3 billion through Oct. 19 from $1.7 billion in July, data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. shows. Glencore declined to comment. As investors doubted about the finances of Glencore and its rivals, the price of their debt gyrated wildly. Yields on Glencore notes denominated in swiss francs due in 2016 surged to more than 16 percent on Sept. 28, up from less than 1 percent weeks earlier. Dwight Anderson, founder of commodity hedge fund Ospraie Management, said in a \u201cBloomberg <GO>\u201d television interview with Stephanie Ruhle and David Westin that Glencore\u2019s debt offered a better risk-adjusted return that its equity. Other traders have also seen their bonds plunging. Trafigura, which earlier this year reported its best-ever first-half result with $653 million in net income, saw the yields of its 2018 bond surging to a record of 10.7 percent on Sep. 29, up from 6.5 percent in early September. The bonds of Trafigura were cheaper than those of Puma Energy, a subsidiary in which the trading house owns a nearly 49 percent stake. The yield of Louis Dreyfus Commodities\u2019s inaugural bond, due in 2018, surged to 7.09 percent on Sept. 30, up from 3.3 percent in early September. Since then, it has dropped back to 4.7 percent. The yield of Noble Group\u2019s 2020 bond surged in late September to a record of 17.6 percent, up from about 7 percent in August. The bond market volatility hasn\u2019t been reflected in banks willingness to lend to the traders. Trafigura won improved terms on a $2.2 billion loan refinancing deal on Oct. 1 via a group of 28 banks, the same week as the yield of its bonds surged to a record.

An Anglo spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. \u201cToday\u2019s market appetite is low, and we think Anglo is likely to wait for a cyclical recovery before realistically considering a separation,\u201d HSBC said. The bank said that while it would expect Anglo to retain a stake after an initial public offering, a full sale of its stake would fetch more than $10 billion. Anglo bought the Oppenheimer family\u2019s 40 percent stake in De Beers for $5.1 billion in 2012, increasing its holding to 85 percent and ending the dynasty\u2019s 80-year ownership.

Rough diamond prices fell 6.9 percent in the last three months of 2014, the steepest drop since the second quarter of 2012, according to data from U.K.-based WWW International Diamond Consultants. That comes after the stones had previously resisted the slump in other commodities from oil to iron ore, with prices advancing about 30 percent in the past five years. The diamond industry has been hit by a lending drought after KBC Groep NV   it\u2019s winding down its Antwerp Diamond Bank unit, a source of finance for 80 years to the network of companies that trade, cut and polish diamonds in the Belgian port city. Other lenders, including ABN Amro Bank NV, have cut the proportion of gem purchases they were willing to finance amid fears that prices had risen too fast. \u201cThe biggest thing really is the tightening liquidity,\u201d said Ed Sterck, an analyst at Bank of Montreal. \u201cIf you\u2019re a cutter or polisher of rough whose available liquidity is being reduced you\u2019ve got to adjust your inventory. Selling inventory to increase cash has the knock on effect of increasing the supply of polished diamonds.\u201d The midstream diamond industry, which buys rough stones from mining companies and sells polished gems to jewelry retailers, is dominated by family owned firms that crisscross the globe from trading hubs in Antwerp, Mumbai, New York and Tel Aviv. These firms depend heavily on credit to purchase the rough stones that can take many months to sell as polished jewels. KBC is winding down the Antwerp Diamond Bank, or ADB, after a sale to China\u2019s Yinren Group collapsed in September. The bank was forced to sell the unit as part of conditions imposed by the European Commission for receiving state aid in 2008 and 2009. ADB accounted for more than 10 percent of the $15 billion diamond-finance market and extended credit to about one-third of the city\u2019s gem merchants. While the slump in prices pared earlier gains, rough diamonds were little changed last year, avoiding the trauma that has hit oil and iron ore, which tumbled 46 percent and 47 percent respectively. Rough Diamond prices have gained in five of the last six years, underpinned by tight supply and the burgeoning middle class in China and India. \u201cI suspect it will be relatively temporary blip,\u201d said Sterck. \u201cIt could be a six-month time frame unless we see further reductions in liquidity.\u201d Diamond output fell to about 146 million carats last year from a 2006 peak of 176 million carats as the industry faces a dearth of new projects. \u201cDiamond prices, even with the current pullback, are at historically elevated levels, and at levels where producers are expected to make attractive returns,\u201d said Sterck.","timestamp":1420707718.0,"participant_ids":["424688Z:US","KBC:BB"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-08\/rough-diamond-prices-drop-as-bank-withdrawal-produces-jewel-glut","subject":"Rough Diamond Prices Drop as Bank Withdrawal Produces Jewel Glut"},{"body":" A Saudi-backed company agreed to buy a majority stake in the former Canadian Wheat Board in a C$250 million ($203 million) deal that gives it access to grain exports from Canada. Bunge Ltd. and state-owned Saudi Agricultural & Livestock Investment Company (SALIC) will acquire a 50.1 percent stake in CWB through a joint venture, White Plains, New York-based Bunge said Wednesday in a statement. The transaction is expected to close in July. SALIC was established in November 2011 to secure adequate food supplies for Saudi Arabia, according to its  . The Riyadh-based company makes investments in countries with surplus grain, and the transaction announced today \u201cfits exactly with their vision,\u201d said Karl Gerrand, chief executive officer of the Bunge-SALIC joint venture G3 Global Grain Group. \u201cWe have surplus exportable grain that\u2019s available in Canada,\u201d Gerrand said Wednesday at a press conference in Winnipeg. The federal government ended the Winnipeg-based Canadian Wheat Board\u2019s seven-decade marketing   on wheat and barley on Aug. 1, 2012, in an effort to increase competition in grain-handling. Since then, the company has acquired Mission Terminal Inc.,  , Great Sandhills Terminal Ltd. and announced the construction of four grain  . The government had given CWB four years to submit a \u201ccommercialization\u201d plan to the minister of agriculture. The federal government isn\u2019t concerned about a Saudi-backed company buying a stake in the former Canadian Wheat Board, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said Wednesday at the press conference. Industry Canada has approved the acquisition, he said. Pat Martin, an opposition Member of Parliament from Manitoba, said it was a \u201csad day for the Canadian grain industry,\u201d noting that the former wheat board protected farmers from the \u201cagrifood giants who are now taking over.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a $6 or $7 billion business, legislated it out of business, and handed it over to American and Saudi businesses that until recently were its greatest competitors,\u201d Martin said in a telephone interview. The acquisition is the third major deal in 15 months involving a state-owned company from a grain importing country buying control of a food commodity trader. In February 2014, Cofco Corp., China\u2019s largest grain trader, bought a 51 percent stake in Dutch-based trader Nidera BV. The deal valued Nidera at $4 billion, including debt. In April, Cofco agreed to pay $1.5 billion for a 51 percent stake in Noble Group Ltd.\u2019s agricultural trading unit. As major importers such as Saudi Arabia and China take control of grain trading companies, they could bypass the traditional giants of the industry: Cargill Inc., Bunge, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Louis Dreyfus Commodities BV. The four firms are known as the \u201cABCD\u201d of grains because of their initials. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest importer of barley, and among the top-15 for sorghum, corn and wheat, according to data from the U.S. Agriculture Department. Bunge owns a majority stake in the newly established Winnipeg-based G3, Gerrand said at the press conference. Bunge is one of the largest oilseed processors and manufacturers of edible oil products in the country, according to Bunge\u2019s  . The company opened its newest Canadian crushing plant in Altona, in the southern part of Manitoba, in late 2014. G3 has very aggressive strategic plans and will explore opportunities for further investment in Canada, including the West Coast, once Bunge\u2019s assets are fully integrated with CWB, Gerrand said in a telephone interview. While it will be a \u201csmaller player\u201d in Canadian agriculture industry, the company wants to help fix grain bottlenecks by offering more efficient facilities and work with farmers who will have a stake in the business, he said. CWB evaluated more than 50 potential investors, CEO Ian White said at the press conference. The C$250 million will stay within the private company and the outstanding 49.1 percent will be available for farmers to acquire through equity, he said. \u201cFrom our perspective, this is a very good day for the CWB,\u201d White said.","timestamp":1429095570.0,"participant_ids":["80706Z:CN","BG:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-15\/saudi-backed-group-to-buy-control-of-former-canadian-wheat-board","subject":"Saudi-Backed Group to Control Former Canadian Wheat Board"},{"body":" The world\u2019s largest commodity trading houses are first in line to profit from the much expected return of Iran to global markets as Tehran and Washington enter into the final three-months of nuclear talks. While the global oil industry has been seen as the biggest beneficiary of a thaw, commodities traders including Cargill Inc. Glencore Plc, Vitol BV, Trafigura Beheer BV and Louis Dreyfus Commodities BV have a long history in Iran, helping to export its oil and import daily basics like gasoline, wheat and rice. The U.S. and European sanctions, designed to stop oil and gas trading, are also limiting the traders\u2019 ability to sell food commodities because of banking and shipping restrictions. With a population of almost 80 million and the prospect of strong economic growth once sanctions are lifted, Iran offers one of the world\u2019s biggest trading opportunities. \u201cWe like other people have talked to the Iranians,\u201d Vitol CEO Ian Taylor said in an interview. \u201cThey used to be major players in the markets, but obviously none of us will do anything unless sanctions are actually lifted.\u201d Iran is not only a large crude oil and fuel oil exporter, but has been historically a sizable importer of gasoline, and it is among the world\u2019s top four buyers of wheat, barley and rice, and one of the ten largest importers of raw sugar. \u201cThe whole industry is looking at the talks with Iran,\u201d Swithun Still, director of Solaris Commodities SA, a Switzerland-based grain trader, said in an interview. \u201cIf the sanctions are lifted, commodities would be the first thing that would move.\u201d The importance of Iran to grain traders is such that Cargill and Dreyfus have both employed lobbyists in Washington to press the issue, according to U.S. Senate disclosures. Seaboard Corp., a U.S.-based conglomerate that is a top rice trader, and a smaller competitor Phoenix Grain Inc. also used lobbyists. The trading houses largely stopped dealing with Iranian oil and refined products in 2012 and 2013 after the U.S. and Europe introduced their most recent set of sanctions. Before, Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore were regularly among the top five suppliers of gasoline to Iran, according to industry estimates. The trade of food commodities is exempted from sanctions and has continued. Glencore, for example, sold agricultural commodities worth $162 million last year to Iran, according to public disclosures. But that\u2019s only a quarter of the $659 million the trading house exported two years ago, as grain traders find it increasingly difficult to supply Iran with food commodities due to banking and shipping restrictions. Now, commodity trading executives say they are again on the look out for Iran opportunities. \u201cClients have been inquiring about the opportunities, there is a lot of hope they will be able to jump back into Iran,\u201d said Erich Ferrari, whose Washington-based firm Ferrari & Associates has lobbied the U.S. government on behalf of commodities traders on Iran. The re-start of the Iranian business is, nonetheless, some way off. Ferrari said that some of the optimism is largely \u201cmisplaced\u201d because banks would hesitate to provide finance even if the sanctions are lifted. More importantly, the preliminary deal reached by Iran, on one side, and the U.S., France, the U.K., China, Russia and Germany needs to be made firm. Neither side has provided details on when the sanctions would be lifted other than saying it will be after a deal is implemented and verified by international inspectors, but it\u2019s considered unlikely before early 2016. Until now, Iran has tried to ease the pain of the sanctions on commodities trade by negotiating old-fashioned barter deals with countries including India. It also has boosted domestic production of gasoline, although the quality of the product has been poor, leading to pollution in major cities. All the companies declined to comment.","timestamp":1429560063.0,"participant_ids":["989947Z:NA","0308213D:NA"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-20\/top-commodity-trading-houses-line-up-for-iran-s-return-to-market","subject":"Top Commodity Trading Houses Line Up for Iran\u2019s Return to Market"},{"body":"For all the fears that Glencore Plc could buckle under its weighty debt load, a wave of new bank loans this month shows the concerns aren\u2019t spreading across the commodity-trading sector. Banks are granting new credit lines to Glencore\u2019s biggest trading rivals, including a record $8 billion of loan facilities on Tuesday to Vitol SA, the Swiss unit of the world\u2019s biggest independent oil trader. Trafigura Pte Ltd. won improved terms on a $2.2 billion loan refinancing deal on Oct. 1 via a group of 28 banks. Swiss commodity traders Gunvor Group Ltd. and Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. are also marketing credit facilities totaling $2 billion. The transactions show banks are still eager to loan money to commodity traders even after debt concerns caused by wild swings in Glencore\u2019s stock and bond prices. At one point last week, credit markets gave the company about a 50 percent chance of defaulting within five years. That started to spread beyond Glencore as yields on bonds issued by trading houses Trafigura and Louis Dreyfus Commodities BV widened to record highs last week. They\u2019ve since recovered some of their losses. There\u2019s a mismatch between how bankers and equity analysts see the commodity-trading industry. \u201cI am convinced that analysts who cover mining companies or other commodity producers with trading operations still need more information about the business of trading commodities,\u201d Roland Rechtsteiner, a partner at Oliver Wyman in Zurich, said in a phone interview. The new loans and refinancing signal banks are comfortable lending to commodity traders, whose business models allow them to profit from volatility and lower financing costs amid weaker prices for raw materials. Vitol\u2019s record credit facilities from a group of 57 banks were increased by a third after the initial $6 billion sought by the trading house was oversubscribed by $2.7 billion, the Rotterdam-based company said in a statement. The facilities, refinancing a debt package signed 12 months ago, are the biggest in the firm\u2019s 49-year history, a Vitol spokeswoman in London said. The loan package, coming after Trafigura last week agreed to lower lending rates, suggests some analysts don\u2019t understand the business of trading houses, which can benefit from lower commodity prices and the current contango market structure that allows them to profit by storing oil because forward prices are higher than current costs. Vitol reported net income of $1.35 billion last year, the highest\u00a0since 2011, as its trading business benefited from price swings in the energy\u00a0market. Trafigura, the second-biggest metals and independent oil trader, posted record first-half profit of $654 million this year. Yields on Trafigura\u2019s 606.7 million-euro bond, maturing in 2018, have narrowed 251 basis points since reaching 10.76 percent a week ago. The yield on Louis Dreyfus\u2019s 2018 bond widened to 7.09 percent last Wednesday, before narrowing to 6.64 percent as of 9:35 p.m. London time. Officials at Trafigura and Louis Dreyfus declined to comment on the performance of their bonds and access to bank credit. \u201cGiven the recent turbulence in the commodities space, we have been repeatedly asked by investors on the banks\u2019 exposure to commodity traders,\u201d analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein led by Chirantan Barua wrote in a note Monday. \u201cThe turbulence in commodities has resulted in the bonds of a number of key commodity players trading toward junk levels. Naturally investors are spooked about the banks\u2019 exposure to these players.\u201d Commodity traders have raised at least $125 billion of debt, of which about $75 billion is loans, according to Bernstein. Criticisms that the operations of its trading business are secretive and its\u00a0financing arrangements opaque prompted Glencore to publish a \u201cfunding\u00a0factsheet\u201d Tuesday that further explained its lending arrangements. Shares of Glencore, headed by billionaire Ivan Glasenberg, have more than recovered losses since its record plunge a week ago. That slump was sparked by concern about the company\u2019s $30 billion debt load and its plans to curb borrowings amid a rout in commodity prices. The shares rebounded after it said its business is \u201crobust\u201d and it has secure access to funding. Louis Dreyfus Commodities, the world\u2019s largest raw-cotton and rice trader, said in its interim report last month that it had six revolving credit facilities with staggered maturity dates totaling $3.3 billion. In June, it amended and extended its North American facilities totaling $1.6 billion and in July it refinanced a\u00a0$400 million Asian lending facility with the company securing an option to request an increase of $100 million. Noble Agri, the agricultural commodity trader majority owned by China\u2019s Cofco Corp., attracted four new lenders to its $1.58 billion one-year revolving credit facility, people familiar with the matter said this month.","timestamp":1444125571.0,"participant_ids":["GLEN:LN","774521Z:SP","0170329D:SW"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-06\/vitol-raises-record-8-billion-credit-to-flout-commodity-fears","subject":"Commodity Traders Win Billions in Loans Amid Glencore Storm"},{"body":" When Azerbaijan\u2019s   took over the storied commodity trader Phibro LLC this year, it put a stamp on a new trend: the emergence of giant state enterprises to buy and sell natural resources. Azerbaijan is not alone: Saudi Arabia, China, Oman, Thailand and Russia are also building or expanding government-owned firms to procure and market commodities directly, bypassing the traditional oil and grain traders such as Glencore Plc, Cargill Inc., Vitol Group BV and Trafigura Beheer BV. \u201cCountries want to secure the offtake of their production or they want to secure supplies,\u201d Socar Trading Chief Executive Officer Arzu Azimov said in an interview. \u201cThere is a trend of national companies building trading arms.\u201d The new cadre of state trading houses has deep pockets and lofty ambitions. They have built their capabilities through acquisitions and rapid organic growth, often poaching executives from U.S. and European competitors to do it. And over time, they could damage the business model of the current dominant groups. \u201cThe growth of the state-owned traders is making it harder for the established houses,\u201d said Andrew Montague-Fuller, director of energy consultants Molten Group. Socar purchased the remnants of Phibro in March. The U.S. firm, which once owned investment bank Salomon Brothers Inc. and dominated commodity markets for most of the past century, had been scaling back for a decade. Commodity houses serve as the middlemen of global trade, controlling the flow of fuels, grains and metals between groups such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and FedEx Corp. or coffee farmers in Africa and Nestle SA. Executives from non-state traders have given a guarded welcome to the new entities. \u201cState-owned trading houses are a new source of competition and will undoubtedly change the market dynamics, but will also create opportunities and will be clients for trading firms,\u201d said Pierre Lorinet, chief financial officer of Trafigura. That\u2019s because the new houses don\u2019t yet have the capacity to handle all aspects of trading. Yet the threat from large new rivals is obvious, with the state firms eating into the commodity flows of the traditional traders and enjoying privileged access to the natural resources of the countries that own them. \u201cThe rise of the state-owned traders is an inevitable negative for the traditional trading houses: it increases competition,\u201d said Alex Griffiths, head of natural resources at Fitch Ratings Ltd. Still, the state firms face the acid test of whether their parent companies, often under tight political control, have the stomach to accept trading losses -- common in commodities -- as well as the nimbleness to act quickly on opportunities. When a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Fukushima in 2011, the established trading companies reacted in a flash. Anticipating higher demand for fuel oil in Japan, they redirected tankers from as far away as Chile. \u201cThe main problem is that state-owned companies and risk-taking do not go together that well,\u201d said Graham Sharp, an adviser to consultants Oliver Wyman & Co. and co-founder of Trafigura. \u201cCulturally it is a difficult fit.\u201d The rise of the state traders recalls the coming of age of the national oil companies in the 2000s, when groups from Petroleo Brasileiro SA of Brazil to Russia\u2019s OAO Rosneft came to play a major role in the resources industry. The rationale is also similar: keep control of commodities within the state. The growth of the government-owned trader is epitomized by  , jointly held by China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinochem Corp. One of the first of the new breed, Chinaoil expanded from humble origins in 1993 in Beijing to such trading centers as New York and Singapore, increasing its trading volumes by 15 percent a year. A decade ago, it handled about 1 million barrels a day. Last year, that rose to 2.6 million -- as much as Trafigura, the third-largest independent oil trader. Today, Chinaoil is one of the biggest traders of Middle Eastern crude. Chinaoil isn\u2019t alone. Over the past two decades, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, has built its Unipec arm into a trading behemoth with $170 billion in annual revenue -- more than Cargill -- and trading volumes of 4.2 million barrels a day last year, more than Glencore. Unipec has forged relationships with more than 1,000 parties across the globe and aims to \u201cgrow into a world-class oil-trading company,\u201d according to its  . In grains, China\u2019s Cofco Corp. last year spent $3.5 billion on stakes in Nidera BV and Noble Agri Ltd. and subsequently poached an executive from Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. to spearhead its trading efforts. David MacLennan, CEO of Cargill, has called Cofco\u2019s plans \u201ctransformational.\u201d In Russia, state-owned OAO Gazprom has created a gas and power trading arm that more than tripled profit in 2013 from 2008. Gazprom Marketing & Trading began 16 years ago with two traders in London\u2019s sleepy suburb of Richmond; today it employs hundreds in the U.K., Houston, Singapore and elsewhere. In Saudi Arabia, state oil giant Saudi Aramco opened Aramco Trading three years ago to buy and sell refined products. This year, Saudi Agricultural & Livestock Investment Co.   a grain-trading business in Canada, one of the largest exporters of wheat and barley. While the purchase helped Salic secure food supplies for the desert kingdom, it also reduced the grain volumes available for non-state trading houses. The trend is spreading swiftly through the Middle East and Asia, with Oman and Thailand establishing state trading operations and other countries preparing to do the same. With that evolution the trading industry, which has enriched many individuals such as Glencore billionaire CEO Ivan Glasenberg, is witnessing a dramatic change. For the state-owned traders, profitability is not all. As Azimov of Socar puts it, national interest comes first. \u201cWe always protect the interest of our countries.\u201d","timestamp":1433102460.0,"participant_ids":["GLEN:LN","3091Z:US","0313312D:SW","585233Z:NA"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-31\/state-commodity-traders-grow-to-take-on-glencore-cargill","subject":"State Commodity Traders Grow to Take On Glencore, Cargill"},{"body":" The tang of Jose Luis Cutrale\u2019s orange juice factory permeates the air in the Brazilian town of Araraquara. For visitors who make the 173-mile trek northwest from Sao Paulo, the aroma is a welcome respite from the stench that normally emanates from the city\u2019s sewage-choked Tiete river. For local inhabitants, the Sucocitrico Cutrale Ltda plant reminds them of home. \u201cI don\u2019t even like the taste of oranges, but I love the smell of Cutrale,\u201d said Andrea Savia, an aide for an Araraquara city council member. Returning recently after a year away, Savia broke down in tears when she took her first whiff of the company\u2019s pungent by-product. Sucocitrico Cutrale has grown under Chief Executive Officer Cutrale, according to filings for its international operations. The closely held business has defied declining global demand for orange juice, a decade-long scourge of crop disease in Sao Paulo and allegations that the executive heads a cartel of orange exporters. Cutrale, 68, is head of a third-generation fruit empire that began with his family\u2019s orange groves and grew into Minute Maid\u2019s largest supplier. He\u2019s also a shareholder of Brazilian Coca-Cola distributor Spaal and has interests in commercial real estate, commodities trading firms and a U.S.-based aircraft operator. His fortune, valued at $2.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, makes him the 26th-richest person in Brazil. He doesn\u2019t appear on an international wealth ranking and declined to comment for this story. Sales have increased at Sucocitrico Cutrale as orange output from Florida heads toward a 25-year low. Worldwide consumption of orange juice in the top 40 markets dropped 11 percent in the past decade, with demand in the U.S. dropping by 27 percent, according to data from Brazil\u2019s association of citrus juice exporters. To diversify, Cutrale began growing soy to export to Asia, and joined with Brazilian banking billionaire Joseph Safra in a $1.3 billion buyout of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita Brands International Inc., which was completed in January. In the Chiquita bid, Cutrale revealed that his family\u2019s empire controls more than 33 percent of the $5 billion global orange juice industry. Chiquita\u2019s pineapples, fruit chips and salad products have reduced Cutrale\u2019s exposure to oranges as flavored water and single-serve coffee cut into demand for orange juice, said Brett Hundley, analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, which has offered investment banking services to Chiquita. \u201cDiversification, when done well, is a blessed strategy,\u201d Marcos Fava Neves, professor of strategy at University of Sao Paulo\u2019s economic school, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe world\u2019s orange juice market is in decline. So maintaining its leadership in juice, but also looking after soy and fruits, is a good route if Cutrale wants to keep growing.\u201d Cutrale\u2019s buyout came after the U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta dismissed a case in July by thousands of Colombians who contend Chiquita financed paramilitaries. Plaintiffs say they are seeking further review, including in the Supreme Court if necessary. The company pleaded guilty in 2007 to U.S. criminal charges stemming from the payments at issue in the Atlanta case and paid a $25 million fine. Cutrale and Chiquita declined to comment further. Cutrale will contribute cash equal to 50 percent of either $1 billion or the sum of the cost of shares and stock options, share rights, senior notes due 2016 and other fees for the Chiquita acquisition, according to a filing. Ukraine\u2019s antitrust authorities approved the deal and Cutrale and Safra said they notified authorities in Honduras and \u201centered into arrangements\u201d to address the exercise of control of Chiquita\u2019s Ecuador operations, pending approval by Ecuadorean authorities, according to a Jan. 2 statement. Sucocitrico Cutrale doesn\u2019t publish its financial results. According to annual reports filed by London-based Burlingtown LLP, a U.K. holding company that oversees Cutrale\u2019s operations outside of Brazil, annual revenue doubled to $1.3 billion between 2007 and 2013. The holding company has 10 subsidiaries spread across the U.S., the U.K., Netherlands and Portugal, with stakes in Zurich-based Grove2Glass Trading GmbH, Nippon Juice Terminal KK in Japan, and Orlando-based General Avileasing Inc., which owns the company\u2019s jets. It lists Cutrale\u2019s wife, Rosana, and their children Jose Enrique, Jose Luis Junior and Graziela as directors. The family\u2019s fruit business was started by the billionaire\u2019s grandfather, Guiseppe Cutrale, an Italian immigrant who sold oranges in Sao Paulo\u2019s municipal market, according to Eliseu Nonino, a family friend and former director at the company. The elder Cutrale purchased an orange grove and began exporting the fruit to Europe and the Middle East in 1956. His son, Jose Cutrale Jr., bought a juice plant in 1967 and changed the firm\u2019s name to Sucocitrico Cutrale. He acquired five industrial complexes in Sao Paulo state and two former Minute Maid plants in Florida. \u201cJose was an entrepreneur with a grand vision,\u201d Nonino said in a phone interview from Araraquara. The company that Jose Luis Cutrale oversees today looks nothing like his grandfather\u2019s orange business. Employees use satellite imaging of Brazilian groves to ensure the fruit is picked at the right time. A pipeline sends juice from silos in Auburndale, Florida, to a Coca-Cola bottling plant. Blend technicians control acidity levels by following algorithms known internally as \u201cthe Black Book.\u201d Cutrale executives fly in and out of Araraquara using a helipad atop a high-rise building next to its plant, which produces orange concentrate all night. They live in company-built homes within a heart-shaped clearing protected by armed security. A swimming pool and tennis court in the compound is surrounded by orange groves. The company\u2019s reach spans the global supply chain, from about 400,000 acres of Brazilian groves to a fleet of vessels that ship his commodities to at least three continents. Trucks with the logo of a dripping orange slice are a fixture on Sao Paulo highways as they haul juice to Santos, Latin America\u2019s biggest port, where the company rents a private-use terminal. To meet demand in Asia, Cutrale invested in a commodities trading company and soy plantations near Brazil\u2019s Amazon in 2012. Soy exports from Araraquara spiked fourfold in 2013 to $777 million, though they tapered off in 2014, according to Brazil\u2019s trade ministry. Trade data shows Cutrale\u2019s exports surged 62 percent to $1.7 billion in 2013 from a year earlier, and reached at least $1.4 billion in 2014. Coca-Cola and Cutrale buy about 30 percent of all oranges grown in Florida. The USDA estimates Florida produced 125 million boxes of oranges in the 2013-2014 crop year, about half its peak in the late 1990s, when output was 244 million boxes. Brazil\u2019s Conab said production in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states remained stable over the past 15 years, at about 340 million boxes. Brazil was more prepared than Florida for greening, an insect-borne bacterial disease discovered in the state\u2019s orange groves in 2005, because it had put systems in place after outbreaks of a bacteria known as canker, said Juliano Ayres, director of Cutrale-funded Fundecitrus in Araraquara, which releases alerts as diseases spread. Cutrale\u2019s rise in the orange business has attracted scrutiny. In the 1980s, the company was among Brazilian producers accused by the U.S. Commerce Department of selling juice in the U.S. at prices deemed too low by Florida growers, though he had the U.S. anti-dumping measures removed in a World Trade Organization case that closed in 2013. Brazil\u2019s citrus growers\u2019 association accused Sucocitrico Cutrale, Citrosuco and a unit of Louis Dreyfus of forming a cartel to keep prices for oranges they were buying artificially lower since the 1990s. A ruling by Brazilian antitrust authorities is pending. The companies have denied the claim for decades, and declined to provide further comment. \u201cCutrale manipulates the market and creates a barrier to entry from competition,\u201d said Flavio Viegas, head of the association, who supplied Cutrale for more than four years from 2004. Dino Tofini, a juice maker who died in 2013, told Sao Paulo state legislators at a 2010 hearing that he was forced to participate in weekly price-fixing meetings orchestrated by Cutrale. Police rounded up 30 bags of documents and computers from orange exporters in a 2006 operation known as \u201cFanta.\u201d The stash of goods, which included an Uzi submachine gun seized from a Cutrale director\u2019s office, according to the daily paper Folha de Sao Paulo, was blocked for four years before investigators were granted access since exporters said the evidence was obtained illegally. Companies involved in cartels can be fined as much as 20 percent of annual sales in Brazil. Sucocitrico Cutrale denies any wrongdoing and said in an e-mail that it\u2019s cooperating with investigators. The company said it created 20,000 jobs globally and \u201ccontributes positively\u201d to its communities, citing donations of robotics to a local hospital and daily servings of orange juice for 2,000 schoolchildren. Cutrale also has faced inquiries into its labor practices. Prosecutors in Sao Paulo state say they\u2019ve investigated the company\u2019s labor practices 286 times over the past decade, compared to 50 times for Citrosuco and 71 for Louis Dreyfus Commodities. Some probes have resulted in lawsuits and others in settlements. In March 2014, a tribunal ordered Cutrale and two other companies to pay 113 million reais ($43 million) and to stop irregular sub-contracting of orange pickers. Cutrale denied any wrongdoing and declined to comment on active cases. Politicians covet Cutrale\u2019s support despite the accusations. The billionaire pledged 21 million reais in last year\u2019s election, including 6 million reais to President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s re-election campaign and 9.8 million to members of the opposition party that governs Sao Paulo state. In \u201cEntreatos,\u201d a documentary directed by fellow billionaire Joao Moreira Salles on Luiz Lula da Silva\u2019s 2002 campaign, the future president orders an aide to write a declaration of support and ask Cutrale to read it on TV. \u201cI had dinner yesterday with Cutrale,\u201d Lula told a campaign ally in the film. \u201cI said \u2018you\u2019re really my friend, this is the third time we meet. So, when are you going to declare your support?\u2019 I want you to say you are the biggest exporter in this country.\u201d","timestamp":1422338401.0,"participant_ids":["CQB:US","356397Z:BZ"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-27\/brazil-orange-baron-becomes-billionaire-as-florida-output-sours","subject":"Brazil Orange Baron Buying Chiquita Revealed as Billionaire"},{"body":" Noble Group Ltd. fell the most in almost 40 months after reporting a first quarterly loss in more than three years, following allegations of accounting malpractice the company believes to be the work of a disgruntled ex-employee. Noble took a $438 million writedown, including charges on assets scrutinized by the anonymous Iceberg Research as part of its allegations. Noble\u2019s shares fell 8 percent to 97.5 Singapore cents at the close, after a suspension yesterday. Asia\u2019s largest commodity and energy trader by revenue swung to a $240 million fourth-quarter loss following tumbling commodity prices that hit revenues at its mining and mineral operations and required more capital for provisions, according to a statement yesterday. The results come on the heels of Iceberg\u2019s two reports critical of the Hong Kong-based company\u2019s accounting practices. The initial report last week included allegations that Noble was overstating the value of associate companies including Yancoal Australia Ltd., sparking a decline of as much as 15 percent in the stock over two days. \u201cThere were a lot of questions about the accounts,\u201d Carey Wong, an analyst at OCBC Securities, said by phone. \u201cWhether the market is convinced, it will take some time. Definitely there will be an overhang. The market is keeping a very cautious stance.\u201d Noble, which said yesterday it wrote down the value of Yancoal by $200 million, believes a \u201cdisgruntled\u201d employee fired more than a year ago is behind the reports, Chief Executive Officer Yusuf Alireza said on a conference call. The company doesn\u2019t plan to pursue legal action, he said. While the asset writedown won some praise from analysts on the basis that Noble is cleaning house and removing an overhang on its stock, others said that weak commodity prices could further take their toll. \u201cWe believe weak commodity prices could lead to further impairment losses,\u201d Shekhar Jaiswal, an analyst at DMG & Partners Securities in Singapore, said in a note to clients. \u201cThey\u2019re heeding Iceberg\u2019s points to some degree, with the asset impairment particularly on Yancoal,\u201d Nicholas Teo, an analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a good first move. Noble will have to address other issues such as their high debt levels. Short-term borrowings have been rising over the last few years when revenue growth was flattish. There\u2019s a bit of disparity there.\u201d Alireza denied Noble\u2019s writedowns were spurred by the Iceberg reports and said discussions about the impairments began with auditors a month ago. Noble said Ernst & Young LLP had agreed to sign off on its accounts, hours after the company flagged a delay in securing the auditor\u2019s approval that sent its bonds tumbling. The delay occurred after the company said Ernst & Young needed more time to review its own internal processes after Iceberg published a second report. Representatives of the auditing firm read the report and posed questions to Noble management about it before agreeing to sign off, Alireza said. Noble has passed on any information it believes it has on Iceberg to regulators and expects them to deal with it, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t give credence to an anonymous blogger who set up his site a month ago,\u201d the Noble CEO said, adding company officials \u201cstayed up all night\u201d to prepare answers to issues raised by Iceberg. With the downturn in commodity prices in the last two years, Noble has moved away from investing directly in resource assets and sold control of its food division to China\u2019s Cofco Corp. and a group of investors for $1.5 billion in 2014. Instead, Noble has put money into companies that manage resource assets, removing itself from direct operational duties while retaining the right to market the products made by the ventures. Among these investments, Noble has invested in an oil venture with EIG Global Energy Partners LLC and a mining firm started by former officials of Xstrata Plc. Full-year net income fell 46 percent to $132 million. Revenue gained 4.2 percent to $85.8 billion, on 278 million metric tons of commodities shipped. Operating income from its supply chain was $1.49 billion for the year. Barclays Research said in a research report it\u2019s maintaining its overweight rating, noting that operating profit was ahead of estimates and that the company\u2019s write-offs reduce \u201ca key overhang from Noble\u2019s earnings, which we expect to increase significantly in 2015.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite prudent to make an asset impairment,\u201d said Daphne Roth, head of Asian equity research at ABN Amro Private Banking, which manages about $218 billion. \u201cYancoal has been quite a drag for the last couple of years as coal prices have been coming off.\u201d","timestamp":1424937146.0,"participant_ids":["NOBL:SP","YAL:AU"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-26\/noble-posts-240-million-loss-as-its-accounting-comes-under-fire","subject":"Noble Shares Plunge After Loss as Accounting Is Criticized"},{"body":"The U.K. retailing landscape just shifted. Beset by competition from discounters and online encroachment from the likes of Amazon.com Inc., J Sainsbury Plc\u00a0chief Mike Coupe has decided that the best plan is to fight his way out of a corner. His rejected advance on Home Retail Group Plc marks a shift in strategy for a profit-challenged industry that has mostly avoided consolidation as a means of growth. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s approach serves as a reminder of the weakness of U.K. food retailers and the desperation embedded in their strategic thinking,\u201d Tony Shiret, an analyst at Haitong Securities, said in a note. Home Retail shares surged 41 percent Tuesday as investors wagered that Sainsbury will be prepared to pay what it takes to secure the prize. A deal would broaden the company\u2019s distribution network in a market where the timely delivery of goods is crucial, while also making better use of unproductive store space. Yet Sainsbury shares fell amid skepticism about the logic of purchasing a business that has struggled to grow over the last decade. By moving further into product categories including jewelry and televisions, Sainsbury risks straying further onto the radar of Amazon. Argos,\u00a0whose shoppers pick products from a catalog and have them brought out from a back room or delivered to their home, has been one of the U.K. retailers to suffer most from Amazon\u2019s expansion. More recently, Amazon has been encroaching on Sainsbury\u2019s patch with the November introduction of its   in the U.K. Matching Amazon\u2019s service standards is a \u201ctough act to follow\u201d without consequences for profitability and there\u2019s little expertise Sainsbury can add in Argos\u2019s main product areas, James Grzinic, an analyst with Jefferies, said in a note. Sainsbury disclosed on Tuesday that a cash-and-stock bid for Home Retail was rejected in November, giving it until Feb. 2 to decide on whether to make a formal offer. The approach undervalued Home Retail, according to the Milton Keynes, England-based target, whose market value surged to about 1.1 billion pounds. Sainsbury could justify paying as much as 1.3 billion pounds, according to Simon Bowler, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. He estimates that the combination could produce cost benefits of 100 million pounds to 150 million pounds, including the closure of some of Argos\u2019s 800-plus stores. Sainsbury is no stranger to Home Retail, after opening Argos outlets in about 10 of its supermarkets last year. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary that they would decide this deal would make sense on the basis of a very short trial period,\" Charles Allen, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said by phone. Sainsbury said revenue would benefit from selling to each others\u2019 customers, as well as increased scale. The grocer\u2019s statement made no mention of Homebase, the do-it-yourself chain which it jointly founded in 1979 and later sold. That may indicate that the grocer has a buyer lined up for the business, according to James Collins, an analyst at Stifel. He places a value of 317 million pounds on the unit, which accounts for more than a quarter of Home Retail Group\u2019s revenue. Sainsbury\u2019s chairman, David Tyler, knows Homebase from his time as finance director of GUS Plc, which acquired the chain in 2002 and spun it off with Argos in 2006, creating Home Retail Group.

The Department of Energy & Climate Change awarded contracts worth more than 315 million pounds ($489 million) to 27 projects, according to a statement released Thursday. The companies were vying for a maximum of 325 million pounds of annual funding as part of Britain\u2019s effort to cut carbon emissions and boost cleaner forms of energy. They\u2019ve won so-called contracts for difference, which guarantee for 15 years the amount generators are paid for each megawatt-hour of power produced, regardless of prevailing market prices. ScottishPower got a contract to build a 714-megawatt offshore wind farm, RWE Innogy GmbH won for three onshore wind projects totaling 166 megawatts, and Lightsource will build a 14.67-megawatt solar facility. \u201cThe auction has driven down prices and secured the best possible deal for this new clean, green energy,\u201d Energy Secretary Ed Davey said in a   from his office in London on Thursday. \u201cThese projects could power 1.4 million homes, create thousands of green jobs and give a massive boost to home-grown energy while reducing our reliance on volatile foreign markets.\u201d Two offshore wind farms obtained contracts, with the other going to Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd. In addition, 15 onshore wind farms were successful in the auction along with five solar farms, two energy-from-waste facilities and three so-called advanced conversion technologies. The government intends that by 2017 the contracts will replace the current method of supporting renewables, known as the Renewables Obligations program. The contracts were awarded by the Department of Energy & Climate Change and announced on its website in London. Britain is relying on the power industry for the bulk of the country\u2019s effort to meet a European Union target of deriving 15 percent of all energy from renewables by 2020. That\u2019s because it\u2019s making slower progress on reducing emissions from heat and transportation. Ministers intend to get at least 30 percent of U.K. power from clean sources by the end of the decade, up from 15 percent in 2013. The auction was split into two pots. The first awards 65 million pounds a year to established technologies including onshore wind and solar power. The second pot with an annual 235 million pounds is granted to less-established technologies, such as offshore wind, wave and tidal power. The contracts, known as CfDs, are the centerpiece of the government\u2019s energy market reforms. They fix the price of power the generator receives. If prevailing prices are lower than the fixed rate, the generator receives a top-up from consumers. If the current price exceeds the tariff, producers must return money to consumers. The budget for the auction was raised in October from an initially-announced 205 million pounds in July, after renewable energy lobby groups said the   fell short of what\u2019s needed to drive down renewables costs in the longer run. At that time, no funding was allocated to a third pot of the contract mechanism. Those funds would have gone for projects that seek to convert to burning biomass from coal, as Drax Group Plc is doing at its plants. As a result, Drax had no projects seeking funds in the program announced today. The government last April   eight projects preliminary money under another program, which was designed to bridge the gap between the end of the old support mechanism and the beginning of the CfDs. Then, the power price was set by the government, rather than by competitive auction. Five of those projects were for offshore wind, including three from Dong Energy A\/S.","timestamp":1424931122.0,"participant_ids":["0141633D:LN","0905800D:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-26\/u-k-awards-315-million-pounds-of-renewables-contracts","subject":"U.K. Awards 315 Million Pounds of Renewables Contracts"},{"body":" Solar power in Britain is starting rival the electricity generated from fossil fuels on price. Developers that won 315 million pounds ($489 million) in contracts to sell renewable power on Thursday are building five solar plants that will earn little more than the market price for electricity -- and much less than onshore wind farms, which are traditionally the cheapest form of renewable energy. The units get payments of as little as 50 pounds a megawatt-hour in the U.K. government\u2019s first-ever auction for renewable energy support. That compares with about 92.50 pounds for nuclear power and as much as 82.50 pounds for onshore wind plants. It\u2019s close to the 44 pounds that electricity is currently trading. \u201cThe 72 megawatts that solar won is more than expected as onshore wind has a clear price advantage in the U.K.,\u201d said Nico Tyabji, an associate analyst following solar at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The cost of solar energy is crashing around the globe as Chinese manufactures led by Trina Solar Ltd. pump out low-cost panels. The trend that pushed dozens of Western companies including Solyndra LLC into bankruptcy has made photovoltaics more cost effective, even in cloudy places like Britain. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the competitive bidding that awarded the contracts process drove down prices and will result in cheaper energy for consumer. The cost of solar was 58 percent lower than it would have been without the auction and about 18 percent lower for offshore wind and 17 percent lower for onshore wind, the Department of Energy & Climate Change said in a statement. \u201cThe auction has driven down prices and secured the best possible deal for this new clean, green energy,\u201d Davey said in a statement. The price of solar power in the U.K. is currently averaging about 91 pounds a megawatt-hour compared with 53 pounds for onshore wind, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Hadstone Energy Ltd. plans to build a 19-megawatt facility for 50 pounds a megawatt-hour. Lightsource Renewable Energy Ltd. won a contract at a price of about 79 pounds. The three other solar winners, which got higher prices for the year after, are more likely to prosper, he said. \u201cThe two projects that bid very low to start next year will struggle to break even and may not go ahead,\u201d Tyabji said. \u201cThey\u2019re not established developers and probably hoped other projects would push the clearing price up above their bids, which they didn\u2019t.\u201d The competition offered contracts for power sold from 27 renewable energy projects that may generate as much as 2 gigawatts of power. Those include two offshore wind farms by ScottishPower Renewables Ltd. and Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd. that will cost 2 billion pounds each. \u201cRenewables\u2019 costs are plummeting,\u201d said Doug Parr, chief scientist for the environmental group Greenpeace. \u201cWe\u2019ve known onshore wind is much cheaper than nuclear for a while but now we learn that solar power is already cheaper than new gas generation in some cases.\u201d Contracts awarded in the auction were managed by DECC. Two offshore wind farms were successful along with 15 onshore wind farms, two energy-from-waste facilities and three advanced conversion technologies. The so-called contracts for difference guarantee for 15 years the amount generators are paid for their power regardless of prevailing market prices. By 2017, they will become the main method of supporting renewable energy in the U.K., replacing the current system of renewables obligations. ScottishPower and Mainstream will build about 1.1 gigawatts worth of offshore wind by 2019. A unit of RWE AG won contracts to build three onshore wind farms totaling 166 megawatts and representing potential investment of as much as 200 million pounds. PNE Wind AG will build a 20-megawatt facility. While as much as 749 megawatts worth of onshore wind farms won contracts the \u201cmajority\u201d of eligible projects didn\u2019t, said Esbjorn Wilmar, managing director of Infinergy Ltd., which won deals for two projects in the auction. \u201cAs a consequence, a large pool of consented renewable energy projects will be unable to progress,\u201d Wilmar said. Infinergy, along with the lobby groups Scottish Renewables, the Renewable Energy Association and RenewableUK said certainty and clarity is now needed on the size of the budget at the next auction to be held later this year. \u201cIt is vital that the new government moves quickly to clarify process around the next awards,\u201d said Maria McCaffery, chief executive of RenewableUK. \u201cCertainty about both immediate future allocation rounds, but also the long-term vision of decarbonized electricity, and the support needed, will ensure projects keep coming forward at the right price.\u201d Britain is relying on the power industry for the bulk of the country\u2019s effort to meet a European Union target of deriving 15 percent of all energy from renewables by 2020.

The issue relates to the support China pays power suppliers as enticement to develop clean energy projects. Surcharges slapped onto electricity bills to fund the subsidies are too low, leaving a gap between what was promised and what\u2019s being paid out, said Meng Xiangan, vice chairman of the China Renewable Energy Society, an industry group. Left to continue, the trend may foreshadow a reckoning for what has become the engine of growth in the global renewables industry. While China\u2019s hunger for energy is un-sated, less money flowing to developers could ultimately constrain China\u2019s capacity to generate power from nonpolluting sources. \u201cThis will weaken enthusiasm for investment and go against the development of renewable power in the long run,\u201d Meng said. Additional delays could ultimately eat into cash flow at companies such as China Longyuan Power Group Corp., China Datang Corporation Renewable Power Co. and others. About 30 billion yuan ($4.7 billion) to 40 billion yuan may be owed by the government to developers in unpaid subsidies, said Li Junfeng, director general of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation. Some developers have been waiting since before 2012 for payments they\u2019ve yet to receive, Li estimates. A fax sent to the Ministry of Finance, which retains responsible for allocating the subsidies, wasn\u2019t answered. In the U.S., state and federal   have been used to help cover the cost of renewable energy projects, mostly in the form of production and investment tax credits. China by contrast supports renewables mainly in through government-set pricing. Since 2006, China has levied a surcharge on consumers to fund the subsidies. The surcharge is currently 0.015 yuan a kilowatt-hour paid for by users, excluding residential and agricultural customers. The Finance Ministry took control of the subsidy program in 2012 from the National Development and Reform Commission, China\u2019s top economic planning agency. But the transition left unclear which agency was responsible for paying any previous shortfall between the subsidies promised and the money raised from the surcharge. Besides the mismatch between incentive levels and the surcharges, the move to a new subsidy-allocation system in 2012 and complicated application procedures may also be to blame for holding up payments, said Meng at the Renewable Energy Society. The issue is of particular importance at the moment because of the huge amounts of money pouring into the sector in China -- and the country\u2019s outsized ambitions. Clean energy investment in China totaled almost $28 billion in the second quarter this year, up 15 percent from a year ago and more than double investment in the U.S., according to   compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Policymakers want the boom to continue. China added about 17 gigawatts of solar and wind power in the first half alone, data from the country\u2019s National Energy Administration showed last month. The nation vows by 2030 to get 20 percent of its energy from renewables and nuclear power, almost double the current share. Though improving in recent months, Longyuan had about 2 billion yuan in subsidy receivables at the end of 2014, mainly from overdue payments in 2011 or earlier, said Lan Peizhen, Longyuan\u2019s investor relations manager. Payments are now being settled one to two months after the end of the period in which they\u2019re due, she added. Longyuan, China\u2019s biggest wind-farm developer,   net income of 2.56 billion yuan last year. Datang, an operator of wind and solar plants, had about 2 billion yuan of subsidy receivables as of June, according to an official from Datang Renewables\u2019s investor relations department, who asked not to be identified in line with policy. Companies faced with more delays may need to turn to alternative financing, the Datang official said. At the end of June, the government owed more than 10 billion yuan to operators of Chinese solar farms, according to data from the China Photovoltaic Industry Association. \u201cThough the government is working to fill in the shortage in the subsidies, this can\u2019t be done at one kick,\u201d said Gong Siwen, an analyst at Northeast Securities Co. in Shanghai. \u201cThe government has to consider the impact on electricity bills after a possible lift in the surcharge.\u201d The issue could undermine efforts by China\u2019s renewables developers to raise financing from outside China, said Nick Duan, a Beijing-based analyst from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Moreover, the overdue subsidies may sour investors on China\u2019s renewables developers, said Karl Liu, a Hong Kong-based analyst from Bank of China International Ltd. The Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, an organization that acts as a conduit between government policy makers and industry executives, has called for raising the surcharge to 0.025 yuan a kilowatt-hour, according to Tang Wenqian, executive vice secretary-general. \u201cThere\u2019s an impact on the entire supply chain\u201d when subsidies aren\u2019t paid on time, Tang said.","timestamp":1440031757.0,"participant_ids":["3470094Z:LN","916:HK"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-20\/china-s-wind-and-solar-developers-hit-by-subsidies-short-of-plan","subject":"China\u2019s Wind and Solar Developers Hit by Subsidies Short of Plan"},{"body":"Hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, whose founder Barry Rosenstein at times mounts activist campaigns at targeted companies, added new stakes in toymaker Mattel Inc., animal-health group Zoetis Inc. and facilities manager Aramark, among 11 new investments the firm disclosed Monday.

Net income climbed to 2.21 billion yuan ($350 million) from 1.37 billion yuan a year ago, the Beijing-based company said Tuesday in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Sales rose 17 percent to 10.5 billion yuan. The wind operator worked to \u201csecure power consumption through control over both the percentage and quantity of our electricity\u201d subject to grid congestion, Longyuan said. It also actively developed \u201cexternal channels for consumption.\u201d Given its leading role, Longyuan is a proxy of sorts for China\u2019s wind industry, signifying the attention lavished on the sector. Chinese wind capacity has surged more than fourfold since the end of 2009 to at least 110 gigawatts, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. Growth is continuing. China may install a record 25 gigawatts of wind power this year alone, BNEF estimates. By that measure, China\u2019s capacity to generate wind power will be almost double that of the U.S., the researcher\u2019s data shows. Wind power in China is hardly without problems, however.   continues to weigh on growth. The issue is that the windiest parts of China are in the north, presenting challenges to get the electricity elsewhere to the most crowded parts of the most populous country. When the grid can\u2019t cope with the influx of power from outside population centers, electricity is wasted and turbines must be turned off or slowed. The number of turbines idle rose in the six months through June for the first time in three years, the National Energy Administration said last month. Longyuan\u2019s strategy is to invest in regions where operators don\u2019t have to worry about idling turbines, Louis Sun, a Shanghai-based analyst from BOCOM International Holdings Co., wrote in an Aug. 11 note. Operations were good in the first half and the company will \u201csee steady growth in wind installations,\u201d Sun wrote. The shares have risen 11 percent this year. Wind-power generation surged 22 percent in the half while output from other clean-energy sources declined 28 percent, the company said in July. its turbines in Shaanxi, Shandong and Guizhou provinces saw the fastest growth, according to Longyuan. \u201cThe distribution of Longyuan\u2019s project pipeline is the best among the top three operators, with lots of projects planned in the south without such idling issues,\u201d said Zhou Yiyi, a Shanghai-based analyst from BNEF. Longyuan added 1.03 gigawatts of wind farms in the six months ended June, it said.

PJM Interconnection LLC, operator of the largest U.S. power grid, expects to make higher payments in exchange for potential penalties after 22 percent of the region\u2019s plants failed to run on the coldest day of 2014. Payments for each megawatt-day of power capacity may be more than double levels set in 2013, according to one estimate. PJM will hold auctions under the new proposal for power supplies across its 13-state market, which extends from Virginia to Illinois. Exelon\u2019s nuclear plants are well positioned because they aren\u2019t affected by fuel cutoffs in bad weather. Many of Dynegy\u2019s gas-powered plants sit on major pipelines and don\u2019t suffer interruptions when a utility needs to supply gas to its heating customers. \u201cDynegy would be a significant beneficiary,\u201d said Julien Dumoulin-Smith, a New York-based analyst for UBS AG. \u201cExelon certainly would be.\u201d  ., weighing the sale of power plants in PJM, also may gain, he said. Under the new rules, approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June, a 500-megawatt plant could be fined as much as $14.6 million for failure to run during an eight-hour power emergency, Stacy Nemeroff, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in research published July 21. A plant that size can power about 400,000 average homes. The auctions had been set to start next week, but FERC ordered a delay to allow participation by consumers that have agreements to cut power consumption when demand is high, known as demand-response companies. PJM said it may hold its transitional auctions at the end of August. The grid will take bids in the first transitional auction to lock in guarantees of generating capacity covering the 12 months starting June 2016. The auctions will supplement one held in 2013 for the same time period, and prices paid to generators will more than double because of the new rules, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd. power executives and other analysts. \u201cWe needed a mechanism to provide incentive for generators to improve performance,\u201d Stu Bresler, PJM\u2019s senior vice president for market services, told reporters July 14. \u201cFor the first time, generators\u2019 revenue is dependent on how they perform during system emergencies.\u201d Wood Mackenzie forecasts payments of $155 a megawatt per day, up from about $60 in May 2013 bidding. PJM capped the payments at $165.27. For the average electricity bill, that would add \u201ca few dollars a month,\u201d Bresler said. The top beneficiaries of the higher prices may be nuclear reactors, which hold enough fuel to run for months. \u201cWe would not expect that they would need to make significant investments\u201d to meet the new standards, Mike Kormos, executive vice president of operations for PJM, said July 13. \u201cThe biggest change is in the penalty rates,\u201d Joseph Dominguez, executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs and public policy at Exelon, said Wednesday in a phone interview. \u201cHistorically, we had about 500 hours a year, peak hours that we were judged against. Under the new paradigm, every hour of the year is potentially an emergency hour.\u201d Exelon may spend as much as $400 million to upgrade reliability, mostly at its non-nuclear plants, he said. Both Exelon Chief Executive Officer Chris Crane and Dynegy CEO Robert Flexon have said they expect higher prices under the new rules, as competitors estimate the cost of upgrading plants and balance the risk of penalties. The first auction \u201cwill be a good indicator\u201d of capacity prices for later years, Paul Farr, CEO of Talen Energy Corp., a generator in Allentown, Pennsylvania, said in a July 7 interview. The grid will hold a second transitional auction covering the year starting June 2017, which supplements one held in 2014. PJM plans its full new auction, covering the June 2018 year, for Aug. 10, saying Thursday that it\u2019s not affected by the transitional auction delays. \u201cThe real impact won\u2019t be known until we have the next blistering heat wave or the next real cold weather,\u201d Ralph Izzo, CEO of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. in New Jersey, a supplier and buyer of PJM power, said in a July 17 Bloomberg interview. \u201cWhen people can\u2019t perform and they get hit by this two-by-four, that\u2019s going to create a whole different discipline in the market,\u201d Izzo said.","timestamp":1437595260.0,"participant_ids":["24195Z:US","EXC:US","DYN:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-22\/power-generators-face-big-payouts-or-big-penalties-in-pjm-reboot","subject":"Power Generators Face Big Payouts or Big Penalties in Reboot"},{"body":" Japan\u2019s Topix index rose, after closing little changed for two days, as companies from Terumo Corp. to Kajima Corp. reported gains in earnings.

Uniqlo devoted an entire floor at its six-story China flagship store in central\u00a0Shanghai to products co-designed with Disney. A human-sized Mickey Mouse statue greets visitors to the store, where T-shirts and toys depicting characters such as Tinker Bell, Woody of Disney Pixar\u2019s \u201cToy Story\u201d animated films, and Darth Vader from the Star Wars movies are on display. Yanai reiterated his plans to open 100 stores a year in China, potentially reaching as many as 3,000 outlets as Uniqlo competes with Hennes & Mauritz AB\u2019s H&M and Inditex SA\u2019s Zara to win over consumers in the world\u2019s most-populous country. The Japanese retailer\u2019s design tie-up comes as Disney prepares to open its $5.5 billion Shanghai theme park next year, its biggest foreign investment and a bet on the country\u2019s booming middle-class. Fast Retailing rose 1.5 percent to 47,490 yen\u00a0by the close of trading in Tokyo, the highest level since Sept. 11. The benchmark Topix index fell 1 percent amid a sell-off in Japanese stocks, as more than half the companies in the measure traded without the right to receive the next dividend. Uniqlo has about 360   in mainland China, the most by country outside Japan, where it has almost 850 shops. The company plans to expand its Greater China network,\u00a0including mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, to a planned 1,000 outlets, with a target of 3,000 stores in the medium term, Yanai had said in  .

He said he\u2019ll decide which to buy after trying them on. Yanai said demand for Uniqlo products will increase amid an economic slowdown in China. Everyday clothes with basic designs and advanced materials that Uniqlo sells at affordable prices fit well as China shifts its focus to consumer purchasing from manufacturing, he said. \u201cAn economic slowdown in China could boost Uniqlo\u2019s sales, particularly as shoppers increasingly look for value-for-money when purchasing clothing essentials such as t-shirts and pants,\" Bloomberg\u2019s Jastrzab said.

Consolidated Edison Inc. declared Wednesday a minimum oil burn day, an alert that prompts higher-cost generators in the city to turn on units so they can meet rising demand, according to the New York ISO\u2019s  . The New York MTA, which operates the city\u2019s subways and buses, will cut demand by almost 13.6 megawatts from noon to 6 p.m. and in return will receive a payment of $25 per kilowatt of reduced demand from the New York Power Authority. There are 1,000 kilowatts in a megawatt, and one megawatt is enough to supply 800 to 1,000 typical U.S. homes. New York City power will be even more expensive Thursday with hourly day-ahead prices jumping to $113 a megawatt-hour. The South is also baking. In Texas, demand may jump to a record July high for a second day in a row.

Images of bodies washing ashore and refugees packed in rafts are having a psychological impact on customer behavior, Donald said in an interview Tuesday. Would-be guests are sharing their concerns in Carnival\u2019s customer research and in questions posed to its call-center operators. \u201cThey\u2019re asking, \u2018Do I want to go to sea and have my vacation disrupted?,\u2019\u201d Donald said. \u201c\u2018What if the ship has to stop to pick up refugees? I don\u2019t know who they are, what am I exposing myself to?\u2019 There is a consternation.\u201d Carnival got 36 percent of its $15.8 billion in revenue from Europe last year. On Tuesday its shares fell fell after the company issued fourth-quarter guidance that missed analysts\u2019 projections. The refugee crisis, coupled with an overall economic malaise, is affecting the entire tourism industry in Europe, but the cruise industry is hurt disproportionately because it involves ocean travel, Donald said. Carnival has had to stop its ships twice this year to pick up refugees in the Mediterranean Sea. That\u2019s a fraction of the voyages the company\u2019s ships have made, Donald said. In July, a Carnival ship, the Island Princess, rescued 117 refugees off the coast of Greece, according to the Migrant Report. The Miami-based company reported third-quarter profit on Tuesday that beat analysts\u2019 estimates. The stock fell 5.5 percent to $49.79 at the close in New York, after Carnival forecast fourth-quarter profit, excluding some items, of 36 cents to 40 cents a share. Analysts projected 46 cents, the average of projections compiled by Bloomberg. Donald said the business is still strong and he can\u2019t control what analysts anticipate. \u201cWe feel pretty good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel like we deliver results.\u201d The refugee crisis could have a negative impact on Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the world\u2019s second-largest cruise-line operator, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and closely held MSC Cruises Ltd., Patrick Scholes, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc., said in an e-mail. Royal Caribbean and MSC declined to comment. Two Norwegian lines,\u00a0Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Oceania Cruises, have altered itineraries that call on Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos, a Greek island where thousands of Syrian refugees have landed. Seven Seas Mariner\u2019s scheduled call on Sept. Sept. 29 will be replaced with a stop in Kavala, Greece, according to Vanessa Picariello, a spokeswoman for Norwegian. Kavala will also replace Seven Seas Voyager\u2019s scheduled call to Mytilene on Oct. 29, and one by Oceania Cruises\u2019 ship Nautica\u2019s on Oct. 6. \u201cWe continue to closely monitor the situation and will make future itinerary adjustments should the need warrant,\u201d Picariello said in an e-mail. All ships are bound by international law to assist those in distress at sea, the Cruise Lines International Assocation said in a statement Tuesday. The group said it supports efforts by the international community to address the crisis. One advantage cruise-ship operators have over other leisure businesses is the ability to move vessels, according to Jaime Katz, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. \u201cIf any particular coastal cities become worrisome, or if violence were to rise in a specific location, the cruise operators would alter their itineraries to visit other, more calm port locations in response,\u201d Katz said in an e-mail.","timestamp":1442938455.0,"participant_ids":["CCL:US","NCLH:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-22\/the-refugee-crisis-in-europe-is-hurting-cruise-ship-travel","subject":"The Refugee Crisis in Europe Is Hurting Cruise-Ship Travel"},{"body":" From afar, it looked like finally some good news for Greek markets as returns on government bonds beat European peers. Close up, most investors won\u2019t touch them. The biggest fund managers know that trading volume still is too low for them to buy or sell without buffeting prices. The quotes by banks, showing a 46 percent return in the third quarter, reflect perceptions of political deals over Greece\u2019s debt more than the nation\u2019s ability to avoid default by implementing the economic measures as part of its bailout. \u201cGreece is important to us in as much as it is a proverbial canary in a European bond-market coal mine,\u201d said Mark Dowding, partner and money manager at BlueBay Asset Management LLP in London, which oversees $62 billion. \u201cWe don\u2019t like Greece\u2019s track record on reforms, and have no plan to buy its bonds at this point.\u201d Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Thursday announced he will step down with an eye to snap  , a move the embattled leader will likely use to try to shut out dissenters and return to power with a more manageable coalition. It will be Greece\u2019s second election this year. After months of high drama and a near meltdown of its financial system, the euro region\u2019s most-indebted nation had just managed to agree with its European creditors to secure a third rescue, valued at 86 billion euros ($97 billion). The return on Greek bonds this quarter through Aug. 20 followed a 26 percent loss in the first six months, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. It brought the year-to-date return to 8 percent, compared with 2.5 percent from Italy\u2019s bonds and 0.9 percent from Germany\u2019s. News of another impending vote showed how sensitive the market is. Greek bonds extended declines and Spanish and Italian debt erased earlier gains on Thursday. The yield on 10-year Greek government securities rose 51 basis points to 10.06 percent, the highest in a week, on Friday as of 1:10 p.m. in London. Those few fund managers who took the risk may have reaped a gain. Michael Krautzberger, head of euro fixed-income at BlackRock International Ltd., said in July that some of the company\u2019s total-return accounts bought a \u201ctiny\u201d amount of Greek bonds. BlackRock has since sold most of them, according to a person familiar with the decision who asked not to be named because the transaction was confidential. Tsipras is likely to again win the elections and a more stable government will make reforms more credible, according to Rene Albrecht, an analyst at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt. This development should support most euro-region bonds -- except those of Greece, he said. \u201cThings are definitely looking better in the short term,\u201d Cosimo Marasciulo, head of government bonds at Pioneer Investments, which oversees $242 billion, said before Tsipras\u2019s announcement. \u201cBut there are still some big hurdles to get over.\u201d Take state asset sales. In 2011, under Greece\u2019s first bailout plan, 50 billion euros was to have been raised by 2015 through   of public companies and real estate. Only 7.7 billion euros in sales have been agreed so far, according to data from Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund. Then there\u2019s the debt burden, which Tsipras\u2019s government and International Monetary Fund officials have said is unsustainable. With an economic slump crippling tax revenue, the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio could rise toward 200 percent, according to an IMF   in July. By comparison, most advanced economies are well under 100 percent. \u201cThe country is insolvent,\u201d said John Anderson, a money manager at Smith & Williamson, an investment company with the equivalent of $25 billion of assets. \u201cInvestment in Greek bonds is a political play, not a financial one.\u201d","timestamp":1440100860.0,"participant_ids":["2539Z:GR","2539Z:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-20\/greek-bond-rally-more-mirage-than-market-as-tsipras-calls-vote","subject":"Greek Bond Swings More Mirage Than Market as Tsipras Plans Vote"},{"body":"Colombia\u2019s state-controlled Ecopetrol SA is seeking to leave Africa after exploration investments in Angola failed to produce commercial oil or gas.

Greece is due to receive a first installment of funds from the European Stability Mechanism on Thursday, in time to pay the European Central Bank and clear its arrears with other creditors. Finance ministers approved the bailout deal on a Wednesday conference call. \u201cThe Greek government is bound to implementing this wide-ranging reform package with determination and we will monitor the process closely,\u201d said Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who leads the group of euro-area ministers. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy. We are certain to encounter problems in the coming years but I trust we will be able to tackle them.\u201d The aid deal comes after months of negotiations and   in Greece and in creditor nations. Lawmakers in Germany and the Netherlands signed off on the plan earlier Wednesday, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte fought off domestic opposition to push the bailout through. Greece is due to receive 13 billion euros on Thursday and another 10 billion euros will go into a segregated ESM account that is available for bank recapitalization. A separate 3 billion euros is slated to be disbursed by the end of November. The International Monetary Fund will review whether to contribute money to Greece later this year when European authorities will also assess the nation\u2019s progress in meeting its commitments. The euro area also plans to evaluate debt relief options for Greece at that time. \u201cIt\u2019s done, after hard work,\u201d Martin Selmayr, chief of staff for Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, said in a Twitter message after the deal was approved. \u201cNew stability support for Greece agreed by whole euro area.\u201d Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis signed the deal on behalf of the EU.

The decision followed a review of global correspondent banking relationships as part of efforts to comply with international standards, it said. Angola ranks among the 20 most-corrupt countries in the world, placing   nations in Berlin-based Transparency International\u2019s 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index. Bank of America decided to halt the supply of greenbacks to the oil-producing African country, two people   of the matter said last week. \u201cWe remain committed to Angola and to continuing and growing our business in the country, including our joint venture with Empresa Nacional de Seguros de Angola,\u201d Standard Chartered said. \u201cThese restrictions do not affect our local kwanza clearing or any other local interbank activities.\u201d The decision to end dollar-clearing in Angola, encompassing services such as cross-border payments, collections, trade and investment, comes as Standard Chartered Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters attempts to improve compliance procedures. The bank was fined $667 million in 2012 for breaching U.S. sanctions on Iran and last year agreed to pay another $300 million to U.S. regulators for failing to flag suspicious transactions. The bank has hired a series of former intelligence officers, including Iain Lobban, a former head of the British   GCHQ, and created a board-level financial crime risk committee to oversee the firm\u2019s anti-money laundering, sanctions compliance, corruption and tax crime prevention efforts. Angola, where people use dollars to hedge against the depreciating local currency, travel in neighboring states and to buy cars and imported goods, is encouraging the use of euros, rands and renminbi as alternatives. The country has devalued the kwanza twice this year as sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s third-largest economy and No. 2 oil producer struggles to cope with a slump in the price of crude, causing the official rate to drop by about 30 percent to 133.90 against the dollar. On the black market, $1 is now worth as much as 270 kwanza, compared with 230 kwanza in September. Standard Chartered opened a representative office in Angola in 2010 and started operating as\u00a0Standard Chartered Bank Angola\u00a0in partnership with ENSA last year, making it the only large British lender on the ground.

While real estate investment trusts haven\u2019t rebounded to their 2007 peak, \u201cour investors did well.\u201d The purchase of Sam Zell\u2019s Equity Office -- at the time the biggest office landlord in the U.S. -- was the first in a series of milestone deals that established Blackstone as the biggest private equity investor in real estate. The firm followed that same year with the $26 billion takeover of what\u2019s now Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., which became the most   private equity purchase on record. This month, Blackstone agreed to   most of General Electric Co.\u2019s real estate holdings in a $23 billion deal with Wells Fargo & Co. that\u2019s the largest property transaction since the financial crisis. Blackstone has been gradually unwinding its Equity Office holdings as real estate markets rebound from the 2008 crash. The largest recent transaction was in December, when the company agreed to sell 26 properties in Northern California to Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. for $3.5 billion. Blackstone still holds about 10 million square feet (930,000 square meters) of Equity Office buildings, mainly in West Los Angeles and Boston, that the firm has said it expects to sell by the end of the year. When Blackstone bought Equity Office, the REIT was trading at a discount to private-market valuations based on cash flow, said Gray, 45. Amid a bidding war with Vornado Realty Trust, Blackstone negotiated agreements to sell hundreds of Equity Office\u2019s more than 500 properties before completing its purchase, to reduce the firm\u2019s cost. Cheap financing from the securitized mortgage market fueled a frenzy of deal making at the time. The Equity Office transactions included the $7 billion sale of seven Manhattan office buildings to developer Harry Macklowe, and properties sold to a company led by Los Angeles investor Robert Maguire, both of whom foundered when credit markets seized up and they couldn\u2019t refinance. Blackstone hired Eastdil Secured LLC, the real estate investment banking unit of Wells Fargo, to broker those sales. Roy March, chief executive officer of Eastdil, moderated Gray\u2019s talk Thursday. \u201cWhat looked like a very aggressive thing we did, buying $39 billion of real estate, thanks to Roy and his team, we had basically sold $30 billion of that, half of that $30 billion basically prior to closing, the rest within 60 days or so,\u201d Gray told the gathering. \u201cSo we felt like we were match-funded and that the basis we kept in the remaining assets that we would end up holding through the storm, was reasonable.\u201d Equity Office and Hilton are Blackstone\u2019s two largest deals ever by equity invested. Both were acquired when the market was frothy and both were marked down on paper after credit markets froze, Equity Office to about 65 cents on the dollar, and Hilton in 2009 to less than 30 cents on the dollar, Gray said. Blackstone also has more than tripled its money in Hilton as the hotel market recovered and the company expanded globally. Hilton\u2019s stock closed at $30.31 yesterday. Blackstone\u2019s cost basis was about $8.60 a share, said Gray, whose firm still owns about 55 percent of the McLean, Virginia-based hotel company. With Equity Office and Hilton, \u201cone of the critical things we did was put in place capital structures that allowed these businesses to survive: five-, six-year terms on the debt, no amortization, mostly floating-rate debt in case the economy slowed down,\u201d and no covenants on the debt, he said. Blackstone restructured the debt in both deals after putting in more money. Blackstone manages about $93 billion of investor capital in its real estate unit. It recently raised more than $15 billion for the largest-ever closed-end private equity property fund. The firm continues to make new U.S. office investments with potential for new leasing or other improvements, even as it sells the rest of Equity Office. In March, Blackstone agreed to pay $1.3 billion for Chicago\u2019s  , the building formerly known as the Sears Tower and the second-tallest skyscraper in the U.S. The company plans to upgrade the retail and observatory space, one of Chicago\u2019s top tourist attractions. \u201cI grew up in Chicago so I always think of it as the Sears Tower,\u201d said Gray, a native of the city\u2019s Highland Park suburb. \u201cI gotta tell you, of anything I\u2019ve done, my mom is most proud of this transaction,\u201d he said, to laughter from the crowd. \u201cAll her friends called and e-mailed about that.\u201d Blackstone also has made a big push into distressed commercial and residential assets in Europe after prices fell and lending dried up, Gray said. The firm\u2019s investments there include a \u201csignificant bet\u201d on Spanish housing in expectations of a recovery, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve bought now over $30 billion of properties, invested $11 or $12 billion of equity in Europe in the last three and a half years during a period most people were waiting for the all-clear sign,\u201d Gray said.

They\u2019re now going to be joined by thousands of additional stores that will soon be vacant as retailers such as RadioShack Corp. file for bankruptcy and department-store operators including J.C. Penney Co. and Macy\u2019s Inc. cut locations to save money. Vacancies at U.S. regional malls rose to 8 percent in the fourth quarter from 7.9 percent a year earlier, partly because of Sears Holdings Corp. store closures, according to Reis Inc. The real estate recovery for neighborhood and community shopping centers has \u201cremained at a snail\u2019s pace,\u201d the New York-based research firm said in January. \u201cNet demand is a fraction of what it was in the last cycle,\u201d said Ryan McCullough, a senior real estate economist at Washington-based CoStar Group Inc. \u201cPart of that reason is the store closures that have been happening and will be happening.\u201d Retailers and restaurateurs said last year they planned to close 5,483 locations, more than double the 2,592 in 2013, which was a record low, according to a report by the International Council of Shopping Centers and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. Last year\u2019s total was the highest since 2010, according to the study. Since then, retailers including apparel chains Wet Seal Inc. and Cache Inc. have filed for bankruptcy. Fort Worth, Texas-based RadioShack, with about 4,000 locations, sought protection from creditors on Feb. 5. More troublesome for landlords than the relatively small Wet Seal and RadioShack locations are the spaces being abandoned by J.C. Penney and Macy\u2019s. Replacement tenants will be difficult to find for those stores, with their large footprints. Macy\u2019s Inc., based in Cincinnati, said in January that it will cut 14 of its approximately 790 Macy\u2019s store locations within a few months. Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney said it would close 40 stores around the U.S. this year. \u201cThat\u2019s where I see the most pain,\u201d said Garrick Brown, vice president of research for the western U.S. at commercial real estate brokerage DTZ in Sacramento, California. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really worried about is the department-store space.\u201d The toughest locations to fill will be such stores outside of thriving retail districts, according to Kris Cooper, a broker at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. \u201cThere is no easy answer in a tertiary market for a 100,000-square-foot Penney\u2019s box that\u2019s vacant,\u201d Cooper, who handles retail-property sales, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt just takes patience.\u201d One store J.C. Penney plans to shutter is at Eastland Mall in Columbus, Ohio. Back in 2006, the mall, with more than 1 million square feet (93,000 square meters) of retail space, was valued at $60 million. The property was sold Thursday in an online auction for $9.25 million. Eastland\u2019s previous owner, Glimcher Realty Trust, turned it over to creditors last year in a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The mall has a vacancy rate of about 30 percent, according to a marketing document from Auction.com LLC, which conducted the sale. To understand the challenge faced by the owners of empty department-store space, one need look no further than Borders stores like the one in Chicago that have sat vacant for years. Shorewood Development Group bought the former Borders in the Beverly neighborhood, on Chicago\u2019s south side, for $1.75 million in December 2013, according to county property records. The 25,000-square-foot building has 108 parking spaces and is near stores operated by home-improvement retailer Menard Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club, according to a Cushman & Wakefield Inc. document that advertises the property to potential tenants. Voicemails for Louis Schriber III, chief executive officer of Buffalo Grove, Illinois-based Shorewood, weren\u2019t returned. \u201cPeople understand why it\u2019s taking a long time,\u201d said Ross, of the 95th Street Beverly Hills Business Association. \u201cIt was built to be Borders.\u201d A former Borders store on South Lake Avenue in Pasadena, California, has suffered a similar fate. That location was shuttered about four years ago and has been mostly empty since, with the exception of seasonal use as a Halloween shop, like the Chicago property. The Pasadena property has three floors, including a large basement, with more than 41,000 square feet, limiting the number of potential tenants, said Matthew Sullivan, a managing director at Lee & Associates, which is marketing the store for sale. The building, in a \u201cprime area of Pasadena,\u201d was purchased through Auction.com a couple of years ago by a Chinese investor, Sullivan said, declining to identify the buyer. The owner wants to lease or sell the building. There is no asking price, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too big for everybody we\u2019re working with,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIf it was on one floor, it probably would\u2019ve been leased or sold a long time ago.\u201d Far easier to fill will be spaces being abandoned by RadioShack. The locations range from about 2,500 to 3,500 square feet, according to Anjee Solanki, national director of retail services at property brokerage Colliers International. Such footprints can be used by mobile-phone stores, yoga studios and pizzerias. The size of the RadioShack stores \u201copens up for a lot more options,\u201d said Brown of brokerage DTZ. RadioShack said its biggest shareholder, Standard General LP, submitted the   for 1,743 stores in an auction that began March 23. RadioShack entered bankruptcy in February with a plan to have a Standard General affiliate take over as many as half of its stores in a co-branding arrangement with wireless carrier Sprint Corp. RadioShack\u2019s leases also have attracted bidders including haircut chain Great Clips Inc. and video-game retailer  The landlords who will feel the least pain from store closings announced this year are those with top-tier retail centers with little empty space. Pain is more likely for owners of so-called Class B and C properties already struggling with low occupancies and plentiful competition nearby. \u201cRetailers over-retail and cut back,\u201d Marc Halle, manager of the Prudential Global Real Estate Fund, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt retail, but it hurts the B, C product. It has a marginal effect on A product.\u201d Real estate investment trusts will be able to largely shrug off this year\u2019s store closures, with most large enough to experience little impact from the cutbacks, said Jason White, an analyst who follows shopping centers for research firm Green Street Advisors LLC. Also, publicly traded REITs own some of the best U.S. retail properties, meaning that finding tenants for newly empty space is rarely a problem, he said. \u201cFor the REITs, this is a manageable level of square footage that is coming back to them in one form or another,\u201d White said. Those likely to suffer more are smaller landlords unable to spread their leasing risk among hundreds of properties, said Ryan Severino, senior economist at Reis. \u201cThere are some centers that are going to struggle for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not permanently.\u201d","timestamp":1427335260.0,"participant_ids":["BGPIQ:US","WMT:US","RSH:US","JCP:US","M:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-26\/empty-stores-haunt-landlords-as-more-retailers-plan-cuts","subject":"Empty Stores Haunt Landlords as More Retailers Plan Cuts"},{"body":" Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. is being investigated by the Chinese government about links to a senior official in the city of Shenzhen who\u2019s under a probe, according to two people familiar with the matter. Kaisa, which last week became the first Chinese developer to   payment on international debt, had dealings with Jiang Zunyu, who\u2019s been investigated since October, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. Jiang had served as party chief of Longgang district, where some approval procedures for Kaisa developments were suspended last month. \u201cProbes into corrupted officials are always found with links to business people, because the powerful and the rich are so intertwined in China.\u201d Zhuang Deshui, a professor on anti-corruption at Peking University, said by phone.  have been investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, promising to strike \u201ctigers and flies at the same time.\u201d The private sector has been dragged into investigations and last week the chairman of Peking University Founder Group Corp. was   for questioning as its bank accounts were frozen, prompting international investors to question which other companies could be involved in graft probes. \u201cThere has always been some concern about transparency and this doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Rohit Gadkar, an emerging markets money manager in Barcelona at Trea Capital Partners SV, which oversees about 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) of assets, said in an e-mail interview yesterday. His fund doesn\u2019t own Kaisa bonds. \u201cPeople got caught off-guard with Kaisa.\u201d Jiang is under investigation for graft, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported in October, citing Shenzhen\u2019s provincial discipline watchdog. He\u2019d been a member of the standing committee of the Communist Party of China Shenzhen Committee and secretary of the city\u2019s CPC committee of political and law affairs since January 2013, Xinhua said. Kaisa\u2019s Chairman Kwok Ying Shing resigned Dec. 31, triggering a default on a HK$400 million ($51.6 million) loan from HSBC Holdings Plc. The lender yesterday issued a waiver in respect of the breach. Chief Financial Officer Cheung Hung Kwong and Vice Chairman Tam Lai Ling also quit last month. News Kaisa\u2019s immediate cash demands have been reduced as the company seeks to restructure its debt helped push its 2020 dollar bonds up 6.6 cents, the most on record, to 40.6 cents on the dollar, the highest in a week, Bloomberg-compiled prices show. Last week, Kaisa missed a $23 million interest payment on the $500 million of 10.25 percent bonds, it said in a Jan. 12 statement. The company has been silent about the reasons for the departures or whereabouts of executives that quit and is now seeking a restructuring adviser. Kaisa\u2019s media relations department didn\u2019t respond to calls and e-mailed questions about the Jiang investigation. The Shenzhen city government\u2019s media department referred questions and a request for contact information for Jiang or a legal representative to its foreign media office, which didn\u2019t answer three phone calls. Kaisa\u2019s 2020 notes, sold to investors at par, or 100 cents on the dollar in January 2013, dropped as low as 30 cents on the dollar last week following the company\u2019s missed payment. Some 31 financial institutions had filed petitions to have Kaisa\u2019s assets frozen as of Jan. 12, court records showed. \u201cSeveral bank accounts\u201d with a total balance of 713 million yuan ($115 million) were frozen and under investigation, Kaisa said in a stock exchange filing that day. Kaisa\u2019s investigation follows the release of Chen Zhuolin, the founder and Chairman of Agile Property Holdings Ltd., who resumed duties last month after being under house arrest in the southern city of Kunming since Sept. 30, company filings show. On Oct. 17, Kaisa issued a statement denying Internet rumors that Chairman Kwok was missing and unreachable. One week later, the government said Jiang Zunyu was under investigation. \u201cFor real estate companies, the nature of their business entails frequent interactions with local government officials,\u201d CreditSights Inc. Singapore-based analysts Sandra Chow and Cheong Yin Chin wrote in a Jan. 13 report. \u201cThis places them at greater risk of being intertwined in alleged bribery probes.\u201d The spotlight shone on Guangdong province in June when Wan Qingliang, a former member of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, was dismissed for violation of Party discipline and accepting bribes, CreditSights said. \u201cIn general, we would view government links supportive for credit quality but this may not always be the case.\u201d International investors are   a greater political risk premium to hold high-yield bonds from China amid concern graft probes may make it more difficult for other developers to repay the money they owe. Kaisa\u2019s loan default and the uncertainty around its reasons have pushed junk bond costs to a two-year high in Asia. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not good for sentiment when something like this happens,\u201d Trea Capital\u2019s Gadkar said.

Fidelity & Guaranty Life said Wednesday that its participation in a $250 million loan to RadioShack arranged by HRG-owned Salus Capital Partners contributed to a $32 million impairment charge that wiped out its first-quarter profit. Harbinger bought FGL in 2011 under former Chairman Philip Falcone, then sold a stake of about 19 percent in an initial public offering in 2013. HRG said in a statement it\u2019s considering the sale of the remaining stake. It\u2019s also reviewing options for Salus that include a sale of the firm after the lender suffered losses linked to the RadioShack loan, four people familiar with the matter said  . The holding company\u2019s shake-up stems from risks it took by branching into investments in distressed companies to boost returns. HRG reported a loss of $1.16 a share in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of 63 cents in the year-earlier period, according to a regulatory filing Friday. Revenue increased 2.3 percent to $1.37 billion. The holding company took a loss of $105 million on the RadioShack loan of the $150 million Salus and Fidelity invested in 2013, the company said. Falcone was   by New York State from running FGL for seven years starting in 2013 because he improperly used money from his hedge funds to pay personal taxes. Last year, he stepped down from what was then Harbinger when its largest shareholder, Leucadia National Corp., raised its stake to 23 percent. Until RadioShack, most of Salus\u2019s     were in increments of $30 million or less, according to its website. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling that firms like HRG and some private-equity funds are buying insurance companies and get them to invest in high-return assets,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cIt\u2019s a question worth asking whether that\u2019s the right thing to do by insurance firms that are supposed to take limited risks to pay their clients.\u201d Falcone and James Hart, a spokesman for HRG, declined to comment. Phil Denning, a spokesman at Integrated Corporate Relations for Salus Capital, and Lisa Foxworthy-Parker, a spokeswoman at Fidelity, didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment.

HRG shares have fallen 13 percent this year. FGL is down 13 percent, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has gained 2.6 percent. FGL\u2019s exposure to RadioShack came through three main investments, Dennis Vigneau, chief financial officer of Fidelity, said Thursday on a conference call. They comprise a $50 million participation in the loan to the retailer, a $63 million ownership of a collateralized loan obligation managed by Salus and a $33 million investment through a reinsurance entity. The gross impairments were $81 million, and included the loan\u2019s fair value decreasing to $15 million and the CLO tumbling to $38 million. \u201cWhen this company came public, certain investors were concerned about some of the relationships between FGL and other Harbinger companies,\u201d Sean Dargan, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd, said by telephone. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind to see there being less of a relationship between Salus and FGL going forward.\u201d","timestamp":1431064800.0,"participant_ids":["RSH:US","HRG:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-08\/hrg-still-paying-for-radioshack-failure-with-two-units-on-hook","subject":"RadioShack Failure Still Haunts HRG as Two Units Take Losses"},{"body":" Relativity Media, the independent film and television company led by financier Ryan Kavanaugh, paid a $401,000 bill after being sued by an advertising agency that claimed it was owed for its work. Palisades Media Group Inc. filed a complaint Wednesday in California state court in Santa Monica, seeking payment on the alleged debt. Relativity paid up later in the day, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Palisades, which performs services such as placing ads on behalf of movie studios, then said it planned to withdraw the complaint. \u201cThis was an unfortunate misunderstanding between our two companies, and we\u2019re immediately withdrawing the complaint,\u201d Arthur Chan, senior vice president for digital marketing at Santa Monica-based Palisades Media, said in an e-mail.

T-Mobile said last week it had its best iPhone quarter ever, not only because of surging sales in its own stores but also from consumers who bought their handset directly from Apple, just as analysts had  \u00a0Sprint Corp.\u2019s quarterly results on Tuesday may show more evidence that Apple\u2019s September move to sell iPhones in monthly installments is so far benefiting lower-priced carriers. Apple\u2019s program, starting at about $32 a month for handsets that can work on any carrier\u2019s network, threatens to displace wireless carriers from the crucial person-to-person sales role. Without loyalty to a carrier, consumers will make their decisions based on cost comparisons on service plans, which gives T-Mobile and Sprint an edge versus the two largest U.S. carriers,\u00a0Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. \u201cSeparating the phone sale from the carrier is bad for the incumbents,\u201d said Kevin Smithen, an analyst with Macquarie Securities USA Inc. \u201cIf consumers take the time to go to Apple and get an unlocked device, then they have already decided not to go the easy route and just get an upgrade from the carrier.\u2019\u2019 T-Mobile,\u00a0for one, embraced Apple\u2019s move to financing. \u201cWe love it,\u201d Mike Sievert, T-Mobile\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview last Tuesday. \u201cIt is interesting. It\u2019s simplistic. It brings consumers more options and it\u2019s been a benefit to us.\u201d It has already been a challenging year for holding on to mobile customers in the U.S. In February, under pressure from consumer groups, all the major wireless carriers voluntarily agreed to unlock phones upon request -- in the past, carriers kept their customers in part by making their phones work only on their own networks. Carriers have been phasing out of two-year contracts -- a longtime practice that helped Verizon and AT&T, in particular, hold on to customers longer in exchange for phone subsidies. All of them moved to phone financing, spreading the full cost of over multiple monthly payments. But only T-Mobile and Sprint went a step further with leasing that gives customers phones on a rental basis. Leasing plans are at least half the cost of the carriers\u2019 average $35-a-month financing plan. AT&T and Verizon say they don\u2019t see much demand for phone leasing yet. They have relied on phone financing and tablet promotions to keep subscriber numbers up. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good deal for the consumer -- paying for the phone but not owning it,\u201d said John Stephens, AT&T\u2019s chief financial officer, in an interview after reporting earnings on Oct. 22. \u201cBut I\u2019m just the finance guy, if our management thought customers wanted leasing, then we\u2019d do it.\u201d Verizon says the carriers could still be blamed if something goes wrong with phones bought with Apple\u2019s plan. \u201cIf Apple finances the phone I don\u2019t have to,\u201d Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said in an interview last month after the company released earnings. \u201cBut the problem comes if the customer has a negative experience. They\u2019ll expect Verizon to take care of the issues. I don\u2019t think the ecosystem impact was fully thought through.\u201d Kelly Crummey, a spokeswoman for Verizon, declined to comment for this story. AT&T referred to comments CFO Stephens made during the company\u2019s earnings conference call with analysts. Apple, under its installment program, sent AT&T \u201ca high number of phones,\u201d Stephens said then. At T-Mobile,\u00a0promotions and lease plans that start at $5 a month for 18 months with a trade-in helped\u00a0boost new monthly phone subscriber additions to 843,000 last quarter. That\u2019s almost twice as many as Verizon\u2019s 430,000. AT&T lost 459,000 phone customers, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Philip Cusick. The discounts put pressure on T-Mobile\u2019s profit, which   profit estimates. Verizon and AT&T, unwilling to match their smaller rivals\u2019 promotions, both reported earnings that topped analysts\u2019 predictions. Sprint, which is unprofitable and facing a   turnaround effort,\u00a0has been the most aggressive on pricing, with leases for the iPhone 6S starting at a $1 a month with trade-ins. The carrier, which has posted   of user growth following seven years of customer defections, may report an addition of 321,000 monthly subscribers for the third quarter, based on five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sprint spokeswoman Adrienne Norton declined comment ahead of the earnings. While it\u2019s still early to assess the full impact of Apple\u2019s financing plans -- the program started in the very last days of the third quarter and carriers typically don\u2019t disclose the numbers of iPhones they sell -- there\u2019s little doubt it will disrupt the wireless industry in the longer term. Analysts anticipate that 3 million to 9 million consumers will sign up for the program in its first year. The numbers may eventually increase to as many as 20 percent of all iPhone buyers, said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. And Samsung Electronics Co., the world\u2019s biggest maker of mobile phones, may follow suit with its own plan, according\u00a0to wireless analyst Chetan Sharma.","timestamp":1446454800.0,"participant_ids":["AAPL:US","VZ:US","T:US","S:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-02\/apple-financing-seen-a-boon-for-cheaper-carriers-like-t-mobile","subject":"Apple Financing Seen a Boon for Cheaper Carriers Like T-Mobile"},{"body":" Fidelity & Guaranty Life, the insurer backed by Harbinger Group Inc., helped finance RadioShack Corp. in a December 2013 loan that forestalled the retailer\u2019s bankruptcy.

Leucadia, which has investments in industries ranging from meatpacking to timber, has already found such opportunities under Handler\u2019s leadership. The company reaped a 50 percent   in less than six months on a 2013 purchase of shares in Harbinger Group Inc. from Philip Falcone\u2019s hedge funds, and in January made a loan to currency-trading firm   that enables Leucadia to force a sale and keep most of the proceeds. The $300 million loan to FXCM came together in just one day after a swing in the value of the Swiss franc left FXCM undercapitalized, Handler wrote in the letter. \u201cWe believe that, with time and performance, FXCM will regain its position in the global markets,\u201d Handler wrote. Last-resort financing deals have been profitable for Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathway Inc., which took stakes in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and General Electric Co. during the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett\u2019s reputation as one of the world\u2019s most successful investors and Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s financial resources enabled the company to get advantageous terms. Leucadia, with a market value of $8.7 billion compared with Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s $363.3 billion, operates on a smaller scale. \u201cBite sizes below $500 million fit our current capitalization and should allow us to take meaningful stakes, enjoy heavy influence (or, better yet, control), please our bondholders and build our shareholders\u2019 equity,\u201d Handler wrote in the letter. \u201cWhen we find something uniquely attractive, but larger than our bite size, we have a long list of wonderful partners we would be happy to work with (and we are always looking to expand that list).\u201d Handler\u2019s letter also describes an investment made by Jefferies in 2012, before it became part of Leucadia. In Aug. 2012 Jefferies invested $125 million as part of a $400 million   of Knight Capital Group Inc., which was on the verge of bankruptcy after a computer error caused losses for the market maker. In 2013 and 2014 Jefferies paid $129.5 million for shares in the open market in what became KCG Holdings Inc., according to Handler\u2019s letter. In return, Jefferies has reaped $192 million in cash and now owns 22.5 million shares, worth about $280 million, according to Handler. Rescue deals haven\u2019t offset lagging performance in other areas, such as the   commodities-trading unit that Jefferies acquired in 2011. Leucadia\u2019s stock has dropped about 10 percent since the 2013 merger with Jefferies, the third-worst performance in the 85-company Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Financials Index. The S&P 500 Index has climbed 39 percent in the same period. In the letter, Handler told shareholders that he\u2019s not happy with the recent results from his   and beef-processing businesses. He said investors should be patient and that Leucadia\u2019s investments will pay off. \u201cIt is a long race and we prefer an endurance contest to a sprint,\u201d Handler wrote. \u201cIf we work hard and smart, and do nothing arrogant or foolish during the good periods, we should be able to greatly enhance all of our operating businesses and create good entry points to new businesses when times become difficult.\u201d","timestamp":1425251439.0,"participant_ids":["LUK:US","FXCM:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-02\/handler-says-leucadia-wants-to-get-the-call-for-rescue-deals","subject":"Handler Says Leucadia Wants to Get \u2018The Call\u2019 for Rescue Deals"},{"body":" Harbinger Group Inc. said it promoted its president Omar Asali to be chief executive officer and changed its name as the firm distances itself from former chairman Philip Falcone.

The miner also extended a two-day slump after Macquarie Group Ltd. reduced its recommendation on the shares. Utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA sank after being cut from the MSCI Brazil Index. Diagnosticos da America SA posted its longest slide since November on disappointing results. The stock gauge fell 0.7 percent to 56,372.04 at the close of trading in Sao Paulo. Its valuation rose to a five-year high last week even as analysts forecast Brazil\u2019s economy will shrink the most since 1990. The outlook for Vale\u2019s margins is challenging, Moody\u2019s said in a note Tuesday. Iron ore has tumbled 39 percent over the past 12 months as miners boosted low-cost production amid a Chinese slowdown, spurring a glut. \u201cWe\u2019re still in a scenario of weak commodity prices, and we need to find a clear bottom there before Vale can improve,\u201d Fernando Goes, an analyst at brokerage firm Clear Corretora, said by telephone from Sao Paulo. \u201cIn addition, the Ibovespa has reached a level where investors are taking a second look, considering economic prospects.\u201d Brazilian stocks entered a   last month, after rallying more than 20 percent for their January low, on prospects spending cuts and the release of Petroleo Brasileiro SA\u2019s results would prevent a sovereign rating downgrade. Still, the nation is struggling to navigate a slowing economy amid the fastest inflation in more than a decade. Vale, the largest iron-ore producer, dropped 2.6 percent to 18.03 reais. The shares have slumped 6.2 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent jump in the Ibovespa. The miner was cut to neutral from the equivalent of buy at Macquarie. The company\u2019s signal that it may reduce some higher-cost output helped spur a rebound of iron ore from a decade-low. While prices surged 33 percent since bottoming at $47.08 a dry ton April 2, they are 67 percent below a 2011 record. Ore with 62 percent content at Qingdao was at $62.58 a dry ton on Wednesday, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. Investors also watched first-quarter earnings data. While companies in the Ibovespa have reported an average 41 percent drop in profits, sales grew by 1.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Dasa, a medical-diagnostics company, retreated 1.7 percent to 9.63 reais in a sixth day of losses. A gauge of profitability tumbled 39 percent to 68.7 million reais ($22.8 million), trailing estimates. Airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA rose 2.5 percent to 7.91 reais as sales beat forecasts.

The court restructuring would allow RadioShack to emerge with a leaner business after a migration of consumers to the Internet left it with 11 straight quarterly losses and depleted its cash. The company would file for bankruptcy protection as early as the first week of February, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Under the developing plan, RadioShack would seek to complete a bankruptcy reorganization with 2,000 to 3,000 stores, compared with the more than 4,000 it now has, said the person. The company also has been reaching out to potential lenders for a loan that would finance its operations during court proceedings, said the person and two other people with knowledge of the talks. The bankruptcy loan, known as debtor-in-possession financing, would fund RadioShack\u2019s operations during the Chapter 11 proceedings. Standard General LP, RadioShack\u2019s biggest shareholder that arranged a rescue package in October, offered a restructuring loan to the retailer that includes plans for asset sales in a bankruptcy, said two of the people with knowledge of the matter.

The companies and New York\u2019s attorney general are set to square off before a judge in Manhattan on Nov. 25 to argue whether the fantasy games should be shut down immediately because they\u2019re a form of illegal gambling, or whether they should keep operating as they\u2019ve done for more than a decade until the issue is determined at trial. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued FanDuel and DraftKings Tuesday to halt the games after Judge Manuel Mendez declined the companies\u2019 request for a temporary order prohibiting his office from forcing the shutdown. The judge said the restraining order wasn\u2019t necessary since an emergency hearing will be held next week. If their daily fantasy sites are blocked on Nov. 25 their clients in New York won\u2019t be able to field lineups the next day, when the National Football League holds its annual Thanksgiving Day contests. FanDuel told users in New York Friday that they won\u2019t be able to make new deposits, while DraftKings said it\u2019s still operating. Schneiderman told both companies in a Nov. 10 letter to cease operations in the state. They responded by suing the attorney general last week, and asking Mendez to rule that their operations aren\u2019t illegal gambling or bookmaking, declare their advertisements aren\u2019t misleading, and block Schneiderman from enforcing his order. DraftKings and FanDuel run \u201ca casino-style gambling operation,\u201d Schneiderman said in the lawsuits filed Tuesday. The games \u201chave ensnared compulsive gamblers and threaten to trap populations at greater risk for gambling addiction, particularly male college students.\u201d FanDuel said the attorney general\u2019s action is causing \u201cincalculable, immediate and irreparable harm\u201d to its business. \u201cIf FanDuel is not able to restore the ability of its New York customers to deposit money to enter fantasy sports contests, FanDuel will not only lose the revenue from those particular deposits but also risk losing the good will and continued business of some of those customers,\u201d the company said in a court filing Monday. The company also said it risked losing customers to competing sites not targeted by Schneiderman\u2019s order. DraftKings said in court filings that the \u201cshocking overreach\u201d of the attorney general has already led a Massachusetts court to issue a temporary restraining order that will allow one of its payment processors to keep operating in that state.

Fiat Chrysler will play a role in consolidation and still sees General Motors Co. as its best-suited partner, Marchionne said in an interview following the initial public offering of the Italian-American company\u2019s Ferrari unit. The spinoff of the supercar maker will help Fiat Chrysler lower debt and make it more viable partner, even if GM and other automakers have rejected Marchionne\u2019s advances. The auto industry will \u201ccollectively pay the price\u201d of the VW diesel scandal as the cost of complying with emissions regulations will rise \u201cexponentially,\u201d said Marchionne, surrounded by Ferrari cars outside the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cThe analysis about the excess use of capital is still valid today\u201d and needs to be addressed, he said. \u201cWhether it is GM or some other solution going forward, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Regulators in the U.S. and around the world are set to tighten scrutiny after VW admitted to rigging diesel engines for years to circumvent pollution tests. That could raise the costs needed to develop cleaner technology even further. As it is, the strain of meeting guidelines was evidently already enough to prompt Volkswagen to  . Marchionne, 63, has been crusading for combinations for a year, highlighted by his April presentation called \u201c .\u201d He argues that automakers waste money by developing multiple versions of the same technology, such as emission and safety controls, and combining would help by spreading those costs across more vehicles. So far his reasoning has been ignored, with GM saying it\u2019s strong enough to stand alone. \u201cTo underwrite an unprecedented level of risk from integration and a cost perspective is not in the best interest of our shareholders,\u201d Chuck Stevens, the chief financial officer of Detroit-based GM, said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. Marchionne has since focused his attention on GM, which is more than twice the size of Fiat Chrysler,\u00a0the carmaker he created in 2014 from the merger of Italy\u2019s Fiat and U.S. counterpart Chrysler. The two companies share multibrand strategies. Also, GM lacks a dominant shareholder to defend it like Ford Motor Co. or Volkswagen. GM\u2019s biggest investor is a trust of the United Auto Workers labor union, which holds about 8.9 percent. Any further push by Marchionne for a merger is unlikely before the beginning of next year, after Fiat Chrysler completes the spinoff of Ferrari.

While GNC and Vitamin Shoppe sell products made by some of the companies, they weren\u2019t charged with any wrongdoing. GNC shares fell 6.4 percent to $29.07 at the close in New York, while Vitamin Shoppe slid 4.9 percent to $28.19. USPlabs and a number of executives were charged with conspiracy to import ingredients from China and lie about their source, the Justice Department said. SK Laboratories, which makes supplements for USPlabs, was also charged in the case. GNC has been under scrutiny by state law enforcement authorities this year, and last month the state of Oregon sued the company, claiming it sold supplements made with illegal ingredients. At the time, GNC called those claims \u201cwithout merit.\u201d GNC said late Tuesday in a statement that it\u2019s cooperating with the investigation and has \u201crigorous policies and procedures in place with respect to third party vendors and suppliers to ensure that they meet the highest standards of compliance and accountability.\u201d Meghan Biango, a spokeswoman for Vitamin Shoppe, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The other agencies involved in the sweep of the supplement industry included the Federal Trade Commission, the Defense Department, the Anti-Doping Agency and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. GNC reached an agreement in March with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on its Herbal Plus products, pledging to test its supplements more stringently and follow FDA manufacturing recommendations. Schneiderman\u2019s probe, which was also focused on retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Walgreens and Target Corp., sought information about the origins of ingredients in supplements and the health benefits described on labels. GNC has more than 9,000 stores in more than 50 countries and bills itself as the world\u2019s largest health retailer. The chain, based in Pittsburgh, sells vitamins, supplements and sports nutrition products. The FDA regulates dietary supplements, though not as strictly as it does drugs. While new medicines require FDA approval based on extensive clinical trial data shared with the agency, dietary supplement firms don\u2019t need FDA clearance. Instead, companies vouch for the safety of dietary supplements and whether the products do what they say they will, and they don\u2019t have to share information with the FDA on how they make their determinations. The rules require dietary supplement firms to evaluate the purity, strength and composition of their products and the FDA can consider a pill adulterated if it doesn\u2019t contain the ingredients listed or is contaminated.","timestamp":1447775475.0,"participant_ids":["GNC:US","VSI:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-17\/u-s-to-announce-enforcement-actions-over-dietary-supplements","subject":"GNC, Vitamin Shoppe Drop on U.S. Scrutiny of Supplements"},{"body":"Ferrari SpA\u2019s ability to sell racy sports cars at high prices has carried over to the company\u2019s initial public offering, even as investors unload other auto stocks in the wake of Volkswagen AG\u2019s diesel scandal. Based on talks with potential investors, Ferrari is on track to garner the 10 billion-euro ($11.2 billion) value that Chairman Sergio Marchionne sought before the Volkswagen crisis broke, according to people familiar with the process who asked not to be identified because the arrangements\u00a0are private. Initial requests for the stock may exceed the amount available by more than 10 times, one of the people said. Marchionne, who\u2019s also chief executive officer of Ferrari parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, has insisted for months that the brand should be valued as a luxury-goods maker, such as clothiers Prada SpA or Hermes International SCA, and not as an auto manufacturer. Those companies trade at over 20 times earnings, more than twice the average valuation of carmakers. Ferrari is working out details of its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in the second half of October as planned, the people said. A price range hasn\u2019t yet been set. European carmakers have lost about $50 billion in market value since Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen admitted on Sept. 18 that some of its diesel engines are equipped with software designed to circumvent emissions tests in laboratories. Volkswagen\u2019s shares have plunged 40 percent in the period, while Paris-based PSA Peugeot Citroen\u2019s have dropped 14 percent and Fiat Chrysler stock traded in Milan has fallen 9 percent. German auto-parts supplier Schaeffler AG, which is also planning an IPO, has been fielding questions from potential shareholders over the Volkswagen scandal, according to people familiar with that transaction. Preliminary talks show the 10 percent Ferrari stake Fiat Chrysler is putting on the market in the IPO could be valued at about 1 billion euros, the people said. About half the full business\u2019s expected 10 billion-euro value is based on the strength of its brand, said one of the people. Ferrari, which will be listed in New York under the ticker FRRI, will be fully separated from Fiat Chrysler at the beginning of next year as the London-based parent company distributes its remaining 80 percent to shareholders. Vice Chairman Piero Ferrari, the son of founder Enzo Ferrari, will keep his 10 percent holding. UBS AG, Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch, Banco Santander SA, Mediobanca SpA and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are advising on the IPO. The disposal is part of Marchionne\u2019s strategy to raise about $5 billion for Fiat Chrysler to cut debt and help fund a 48 billion-euro investment program that focuses on expanding the Jeep, Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands globally. The Ferrari spinoff could generate more than 3 billion euros for Fiat, including proceeds from the IPO and a cash payment exceeding 2 billion euros from the Maranello-based unit. The Agnelli family that controls Fiat Chrysler is also set to keep voting control of Ferrari. More than half of cars sold in Europe are equipped with diesel engines. Ferrari CEO Amedeo Felisa said this month that the maker of the 235,000-euro 488 Spider convertible will avoid adding models, such as battery-powered vehicles, outside its traditional sports cars because its customers prefer powerful autos with a traditional engine growl.","timestamp":1443621216.0,"participant_ids":["VOW:GR","F:IM"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-30\/ferrari-ipo-said-set-to-sell-out-as-investors-shrug-off-vw-fall","subject":"Ferrari IPO Said Set to Sell Out Even After VW's Sharp Fall"},{"body":" Core U.S. consumer prices probably gained in April in a sign that companies are starting to test their pricing power, a report in the coming week will show.

Regulators in the U.S. and around the world are set to tighten scrutiny after VW admitted to rigging diesel engines for years to circumvent pollution tests in the U.S. That could raise the costs needed to develop cleaner technology. As it is, the strain of meeting guidelines and making a profit was evidently already enough to prompt Volkswagen to cheat. \u201cInevitably, VW\u2019s issue creates the conditions for a reshuffle of assets that may lead to mergers among carmakers once the dust of the scandal is settled,\u201d said Emanuele Vizzini, who helps manage 3.6 billion euros ($4 billion) as chief investment officer at Investitori Sgr in Milan, including FCA shares. \u201cWe expect Fiat to be an active player helped by the positive momentum of its business.\u201d Marchionne, 63, has been crusading for combinations for a year, highlighted by his April presentation called \u201c .\u201d He argues that automakers waste money by developing multiple versions of the same technology, such as emission and safety controls, and combining would help by spreading those costs across more vehicles. So far his mantra has been ignored by peers, with his preferred partner General Motors Co. saying it\u2019s strong enough to stand alone. Maintaining resistance might now get tougher. \u201cThere is now clearly a risk that with regulators investigating all carmakers, even were they all fully compliant,\u201d\u00a0said Kristina Church, a London-based analyst at Barclays, said in a note. \u201cThey could conclude that the only way to mitigate future issues\u201d is by imposing a tougher testing procedure. Marchionne made that very point in his April presentation, saying that capital spending by carmakers will rise in the coming years, partly because of the \u201cpush that emission regulation is imposing on the industry.\u201d Sharing costs through mergers is the only way for volume producers to boost their \u201cpoor\u201d results, he said in April. Marchionne has since focused his attention on GM, which is more than twice the size of Fiat Chrysler,\u00a0the carmaker he created in 2014 from the merger of Italy\u2019s Fiat and U.S. counterpart Chrysler. The two companies share multibrand strategies. Also, GM lacks a dominant shareholder to defend it like Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen. GM\u2019s biggest investor is a trust of the United Autoworkers labor union, which holds about 8.9 percent. Fiat Chrysler representatives declined to comment on whether the VW case would accelerate a partner search. Chairman John Elkann told reporters in Rome on Thursday that mergers would be necessary even if the scandal hadn\u2019t come to light. \"The case for consolidation is valid and remains valid regardless of what is happening to VW,\" Elkann said. The VW issue is \"very serious,\" he added. Marchionne has been working with an advisory firm to gauge investor interest in pushing for a combination of FCA and GM and to evaluate possible alternatives, people familiar with the matter said in June. At the time, Volkswagen was one of his possible alternatives, according to the people. The German company has the world\u2019s highest research and development budget, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \u201cVW is very much out of the running\u201d as a Fiat Chrysler partner, said George Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI in London. \u201cIf VW didn\u2019t believe that acquiring FCA\u2019s business would fix their U.S. problems earlier in the year, I am not sure why they would suddenly feel that they need FCA to fix them now.\u201d Any further push by Marchionne for a merger is unlikely before the beginning of next year, after Fiat Chrysler spins off its Ferrari supercar division, as the Italian-American automaker could use the cash from the move. By that time, the industry will have had to grapple with the broader impact of the VW scandal, potentially making peers more receptive to the executive\u2019s pitch. \u201cMarchionne\u2019s push for a combination is more than timely,\u201d said Giuseppe Berta, a professor at Bocconi University and the former head of Fiat\u2019s archives. \u201cHe should push for a merger with GM soon after the separation of Ferrari to leverage a weaker Volkswagen to gain customers.\u201d","timestamp":1443081411.0,"participant_ids":["F:IM","GM:US","VOW:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-24\/vw-diesel-scandal-bolsters-marchionne-s-campaign-for-mergers","subject":"VW Diesel Scandal Bolsters Marchionne's Campaign for Mergers"},{"body":"A Texas manufacturer\u2019s line of purportedly natural workout and weight-loss supplements, sold in stores across the U.S., contained an untested and possibly dangerous Chinese-produced stimulant, according to prosecutors. Executives at Dallas-based USPlabs LLC conspired to sell the supplements under fake certificates and knew their ingredient was linked with liver problems, according to an indictment made public Tuesday. The allegations are the latest of a half dozen criminal and civil cases announced in the past week by the U.S. Justice Department, the Food and Drug Administration and other federal agencies -- part of a campaign officials say has led to actions against more than 100 makers and marketers in the lightly regulated dietary supplements market. USPlabs and a California company, SK Laboratories Inc., fraudulently sold products containing a stimulant called  , documenting it as geranium powder, the U.S. said in its 11-count indictment against the companies and several individuals. \u201cLol stuff is completely 100% synthetic,\u201d an SK Laboratories executive wrote to USPlab\u2019s co-founders in a May 2009 e-mail cited in the complaint. Spokesmen for USPlabs and SK Laboratories didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment on the charges. A statement by the Justice Department, early in the day, that it would announce a criminal action involving dietary supplements sent retailers\u2019 shares plummeting. GNC Holdings Inc. fell as much as 27 percent and Vitamin Shoppe Inc. slid as much as 10 percent. When the indictment was made public later in the day, neither company was charged or accused of wrongdoing. The indictment notes that workout and weight-loss supplements are generally sold online and in big-box stores across the U.S., as well as through national retail chains. The names of those chains are blacked out in the indictment that was made public. Other court documents, however, refer to GNC as one of the national retailers: GNC\u2019s name inadvertently appeared in a version of the indictment that was filed earlier, prosecutors said in a sealed motion last week that sought permission to submit a newer and \u201cminimally redacted version\u201d of the indictment. \u201cAlthough the indictment does not directly accuse GNC of misconduct, this court should protect third parties from harm due to being named but not charged in indictments,\u201d the government wrote in the sealed motion reviewed by Bloomberg News. GNC shares recovered somewhat, closing down 6.4 percent at $29.07 in New York. Vitamin Shoppe\u00a0closed at $28.19, a 4.9 percent decline. A spokeswoman for GNC had no immediate comment. A spokeswoman for Vitamin Shoppe didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department\u2019s action is part of a broader crackdown on supplements that contain ingredients other than those listed on the label or that make claims unsupported by adequate scientific evidence, it said in a statement. The indictments \u201cshould serve as a wakeup call to the supplement industry,\u201d Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said at a Justice Department news conference announcing the charges. \u201cThis is just one step.\u201d The Justice Department also filed five civil suits in the past week against companies it said had misled consumers about their products\u2019 ingredients or health benefits. These were investigated by the FDA and U.S. Postal Inspection Service, it said. USPlabs was part of a conspiracy to import ingredients from China, under false certificates of analysis and false labeling, the Justice Department said. USPlabs told some of its retailers and wholesalers that it used natural plant extracts in its Jack3d and OxyElite Pro products, according to the indictment, when it was using a synthetic stimulant made in a Chinese chemical factory. The defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe, according to the indictment. The defendants knew of studies linking the products to liver toxicity, it said. Four of the defendants were arrested earlier Tuesday and the other two will surrender, the Justice Department said in its statement. USPlabs and two of its executives named in the indictment entered not-guilty pleas in Dallas federal court.","timestamp":1447797548.0,"participant_ids":["GNC:US","0818293D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-17\/u-s-cracks-down-on-diet-supplement-companies-in-broad-sweep-ih43uxf0","subject":"U.S. Cracks Down on Diet-Supplement Companies in Broad Sweep"},{"body":" Stripe Inc., an online payments processor, said it received an investment from Visa Inc. as part of a $100 million funding round valuing the startup at $5 billion.

The company makes it easier for websites and mobile applications to process credit cards and other third-party forms of payment. \u201cStripe aims to give developers the tools they need to create the most secure and novel buying experiences,\u201d said Patrick Collison, the chief executive officer and co-founder, said in a statement. \u201cOur partnership with Visa will accelerate our ability to expand to markets around the world, and give developers even more control over the end-to-end experience.\u201d Visa\u2019s partnership with Stripe will also focus on improving the security and reliability of its processing system, the companies said.

The company, which has been selling its software for two years, has increased its customer base five-fold to about 550 in the year through June, Kempel said in an interview. Already valued at more than $1 billion in its latest funding round, the Westborough, Massachusetts-based company is leaning toward Morgan Stanley as an underwriter, he said. SimpliVity is part of a new wave of IPO plans stacking up by companies that make software for managing servers, storage and switches. All have shown brisk sales growth in recent years as more clients alter their infrastructure and move more operations to the cloud. Their growth has drawn more venture funding than companies typically attract before going public. SimpliVity has raised $276 million. \u201cThe companies are generally bigger, further along, they\u2019ve got sales rather than just a business model,\u201d said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a growth area.\u201d Ritter said the outlook is favorable when compared with the biotech industry, where he said some 150 companies went public in recent years, many with tiny workforces and zero sales. Puppet Labs Inc. and AppDynamics Inc. are among a handful of other enterprise software companies seeking to go public\u00a0by the first half of next year, according to people with knowledge of their strategies. Puppet Labs is planning to raise $100 million to $150 million through an IPO, and is in the process of selecting bankers, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s intentions, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren\u2019t public. No one from Puppet Labs, which helps businesses automate the configuration and management of machines and software, was available to comment, according to Justin Dorff, a spokesman for the Portland, Oregon-based company. Going public may prove to be an uphill battle. \u201cThe returns on technology IPOs in general have been poor\u201d this year, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. \u201cThere\u2019s still interest in companies with a near-term path to profitability. Without earnings, any little challenge to expectations hurts the trading in the stock, so they are more volatile.\u201d Enterprise software startups will also face competition for investor interest with established giants like Oracle Corp., SAP SE and VMware Inc. While the bigger, public companies often buy smaller competitors to spur growth, they may hesitate to buy those with high valuations, she said. \u201cThe M&A market has been slow, especially for highly valued companies,\u201d Smith said. \u201cInvestors of public companies don\u2019t want dilution.\u201d Still, the cloud software market is growing fast and should surpass $100 billion by 2018, up from $39.3 billion in 2013, researcher IDC said in a   last year. Venture capital firms including Accel Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Charles River Ventures, have been in pursuit for several years, along with some tech giants. Cisco Systems Inc. is an   in Puppet and a partner of SimpliVity. Even within the sluggish tech IPO climate, enterprise software companies have been a bright spot since last fall. HubSpot Inc., which makes cloud-based marketing and sales software; Hortonworks Inc., a maker of data-management software; and New Relic Inc., a cloud-based application performance-management provider, have all appreciated at least 50 percent to more than 100 percent. AppDynamics, based in San Francisco, is preparing to go public by mid-year 2016, a person familiar with those plans said, echoing a story by Dealreporter earlier this month. The company, which makes software that lets businesses track application performance and anticipate problems, had more than $150 million in bookings in the past fiscal year and has almost doubled the number of customers, Chief Executive Officer Jyoti Bansal said. He declined to confirm the timing of any IPO. MuleSoft Inc. has raised $259 million, and was valued at more than $1.5 billion in its   in May, CEO Greg Schott said. The San Francisco-based company\u2019s software lets businesses create code for connecting diverse databases and devices. \u201cAt some point, going public is probably going to be the right move,\u201d Schott said in an interview, declining to be more specific. \u201cWe are certainly at scale to where the banks would feel comfortable doing something any time.\u201d The newest crop of IPO-seeking enterprise software companies stayed private longer, and that has led to pent-up demand from public markets, according to Derek Thomson, U.S. capital markets research leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\u2019s Deals Practice. \u201cInvestors are very keen to look at tech companies that have very strong cloud-based platforms,\u201d Thomson said.","timestamp":1438218060.0,"participant_ids":["0610963D:US","0047180D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-30\/simplivity-plans-ipo-next-year-amid-cloud-software-streak","subject":"SimpliVity Plans 2016 IPO Amid Cloud Software Streak"},{"body":" Four major retailers were by told by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to halt sales of store-brand herbal supplements found to lack key ingredients listed on the label, fueling calls for more regulation of the $32 billion U.S. dietary supplement industry. Schneiderman said he sent letters to GNC Holdings Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Walgreens and Target Corp., telling them to drop products purportedly containing herbs such as echinacea, ginseng and St. John\u2019s wort. He said his probe, conducted by a researcher who analyzed the presence of plant DNA in the products, revealed that ingredients on the labels of some supplements couldn\u2019t be verified, and that others contained undisclosed ingredients. \u201cThis investigation makes one thing abundantly clear: the old adage \u2018buyer beware\u2019 may be especially true for consumers of herbal supplements,\u201d Schneiderman said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cAmerican corporations must step up to the plate and ensure that their customers are getting what they pay for, especially when it involves promises of good health.\u201d The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn\u2019t require approval for dietary supplements, as it does for pharmaceuticals. Manufacturers and distributors of the products are prohibited from selling supplements that are adulterated or misbranded, according to the agency. It requires notification of health problems associated with the supplements and can order recalls of products found to violate standards. Because vitamins and supplements aren\u2019t vetted before they hit the market, companies selling them cannot legally claim they cure or prevent diseases. When the FDA discovers marketing claims that cross the line, the agency\u2019s first step is to issue a warning. Laura Brophy, a spokeswoman for Pittsburgh-based GNC, said in a statement that the nutritional products retailer stands behind the \u201cquality, purity and potency of all ingredients listed on the labels of our private label products\u201d and that the company tests all of its products using \u201cvalidated and widely used testing methods.\u201d GNC will remove products from lots named in Schneiderman\u2019s letter from stores in New York State \u201cif required by law, not because we agree with the testing methods used to support it,\u201d she said. Emily Hartwig, a spokeswoman for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., said in a statement the company will cooperate with the state attorney general and is in the process of removing the products from its shelves as it reviews the matter. Minneapolis-based Target will comply with the request to pull the the products while conducting its own investigation, Evan Lapiska, a spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWe take these claims seriously and will continue to focus on ensuring that our products meet or exceed all relevant standards,\u201d he said. Health researchers and consumer groups have called for increased scrutiny of the market over concerns about the safety or effectiveness of the ingredients and reports of some products potentially being adulterated. Lack of oversight has \u201cpermitted the introduction of numerous supplement products, often containing unapproved active pharmaceutical ingredients, into the marketplace,\u201d a team of researchers said in a study of supplement recalls in 2013. \u201cWhen the advertised herbs aren\u2019t even in many of the products, it\u2019s a sign that this loosely regulated industry is urgently in need of reform,\u201d David Schardt, senior nutritionist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said in the attorney general\u2019s statement. Claims of the herbs\u2019 effectiveness are \u201csketchy to begin with,\u201d said Schardt, whose Washington-based group has advocated for tighter restrictions for the supplement market. New York State Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, a Brooklyn Democrat, and New York State Senator Ken LaValle, who have each sponsored legislation to create a dietary food supplements safety committee, praised Schneiderman\u2019s effort. \u201cI will continue to fight for legislation that will provide adequate labeling information for the public,\u201d LaValle, a Republican from Port Jefferson, said in a statement. James A. Schulte II of Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York, was hired by the attorney general to conduct the test using a technique called  , according to Schneiderman. DNA barcodes can be used to determine the exact plant species being tested, Schneiderman said. In many instances, rather than finding evidence of species on the label, such as ginkgo biloba or ginseng, the testing turned up other ingredients such as rice, beans or a tropical houseplant, and sometimes no plant DNA at all, Schneiderman said. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart\u2019s Spring Valley brand had the worst results, with only 4 percent of the tests yielding DNA matching the product label and 56 percent not yielding any plant material, according to Schneiderman. \u201cBased on the testing performed by our suppliers we have not found any issues with the relevant products, but in order to comply with the Attorney General\u2019s request we have stopped selling them in New York,\u201d Carmen Bauza, senior vice president of Health & Wellness for Walmart U.S., said in a statement. \u201cWe take this matter very seriously and will be conducting side by side analysis because we are 100 percent committed to providing our customers safe products.\u201d","timestamp":1422971624.0,"participant_ids":["GNC:US","WMT:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-03\/gnc-wal-mart-found-by-new-york-to-sell-fake-herbal-supplements","subject":"GNC, Wal-Mart Found by New York to Sell Fake Herbal Remedies"},{"body":" New York\u2019s attorney general is demanding more information from big U.S. retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and GNC Holdings Inc. about the herbal supplements they sell, a person familiar with the matter said. The request for information on ingredients and health claims is the latest move in Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2019s probe of the $32 billion U.S. dietary supplement industry. Last week, he told the retailers to remove some products from their shelves because he said they lacked key ingredients. Schneiderman sent subpoenas to Wal-Mart, GNC, Walgreens and Target Corp. on Wednesday seeking information about the origins of ingredients in their supplements and the health benefits described on labels, said the person, who asked not to be named because the investigation isn\u2019t public. The attorney general wants to know whether the ingredients are natural or synthetic, where they are grown and who the suppliers are, according to the person. He\u2019s also seeking documents the companies relied on in asserting health claims, the person said. The subpoenas follow Schneiderman\u2019s announcement of results from tests into store-brand supplements. There were signs that some products lacked key ingredients identified on their labels, such as echinacea and ginkgo biloba, or contained substances that weren\u2019t listed, including rice or tropical houseplants, he said. \u201cThe industry has a responsibility to make sure consumers know what they are paying for, especially when the product includes promises of good health,\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe burden is on the industry now to prove that the manufacture of herbal supplements is being held to a rigorous standard.\u201d Health claims being examined by Schneiderman include statements that GNC\u2019s ginkgo biloba \u201cmay support mental sharpness\u201d and that Wal-Mart\u2019s Spring Valley brand echinacea \u201csupports healthy immune function,\u201d according to the person familiar with the probe. Evan Lapiska, a spokesman for Minneapolis-based Target, and Emily Hartwig, a spokeswoman for Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., said in e-mailed statements that the companies will continue cooperating with Schneiderman.

GNC provided \u201cfull and robust responses to every question raised in his letter, including original test results and the results of retesting,\u201d Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for GNC with Sard Verbinnen & Co., said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cAll results demonstrated that our products are pure, safe and fully compliant,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe Attorney General has refused to provide us access to his test results and therefore we cannot comment on the allegations in this subpoena.\u201d James A.

Pittsburgh-based GNC Holdings Inc.\u2019s stock price fell as much as 7 percent Tuesday following news of the expanded probe. Herbal supplements make up about 8 percent of the nutritional retailer\u2019s sales, according to analysts from Jefferies LLC. Earlier, a researcher hired by New York found evidence that store-brand products from GNC, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Walgreens and Target Corp. purportedly containing supplements such as   and   lacked those signature ingredients or contained substances not on the label, the state said.

In response to state inquiries, GNC has conducted \u201crigorous tests\u201d to show that its products are safe and properly labeled, according to a statement Monday. GNC also will begin performing DNA barcoding on products -- a method of confirming that supplements have the right ingredients -- and add signs to help consumers figure out what they\u2019re buying. The accord represents a victory for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has been trying to rein in the herbal-supplements industry -- a loosely regulated market. It also brings relief to GNC investors, who didn\u2019t want the company dragged into a protracted fight over the issue. The shares jumped 7 percent after the announcement. The deal \u201csuccessfully turns a lingering negative into a positive,\u201d Chuck Grom, an analyst at Sterne Agee Group Inc., said in a report. The move should help placate regulators, while improving consumer confidence in GNC products, said Grom, who has a buy rating on the shares. The stock rose to $49.26 at the close in New York, the biggest one-day gain since Feb. 12. The stock is now up 4.9 percent this year. Schneiderman said at a news conference in Manhattan on Monday that the measures GNC is taking are a \u201cvery significant undertaking\u201d which are \u201cbreaking with the pattern and practices of the industry.\u201d The probe into supplements will continue against other retailers and manufacturers, Schneiderman said. New York may continue actions against GNC if it doesn\u2019t abide by the terms of the agreement, he said, adding that the office hasn\u2019t reached a legal determination of whether the nutrition product retailer\u2019s practices were fraudulent. \u201cThis has nothing to do with the efficacy of the product,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cThis has to do with consumer fraud.\u201d Schneiderman had sent subpoenas to GNC, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Walgreens and Target Corp. last month seeking information about the origins of ingredients in their supplements and the health benefits described on labels, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the investigation isn\u2019t public. The attorney general wanted to know whether the ingredients are natural or synthetic, where they are grown and who the suppliers are, according to the person. He\u2019s also seeking documents the companies relied on in asserting health claims, the person said. GNC has more than   in 50 countries and bills itself as the world\u2019s largest health retailer. The chain, based in Pittsburgh, sells vitamins, supplements and sports nutrition. Schneiderman\u2019s subpoenas followed an announcement of results from tests into store-brand supplements. There were indications that some products lacked key ingredients identified on their labels, such as echinacea and ginkgo biloba, or contained substances that weren\u2019t listed, including rice or tropical houseplants, he said. \u201cAmerican corporations must step up to the plate and ensure that their customers are getting what they pay for, especially when it involves promises of good health,\u201d Schneiderman said last month. Wal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retail chain, said it\u2019s submitting information to Schneiderman and will continue to work with his office. \u201cThe specific products called into question were tested by the manufacturers during and at the end of production,\u201d Brian Nick, a spokesman for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe results confirmed that the ingredients on the label were present and the products were not adulterated.\u201d Walgreens, meanwhile, said it\u2019s taking the issue seriously. \u201cWe continue to review this matter and also intend to continue cooperating and working with the attorney general,\u201d said Michael Polzin, a spokesman for the drugstore chain. Target didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The FDA regulates dietary supplements, though not as strictly as it does drugs. While new medicines require FDA approval based on extensive clinical trial data shared with the agency, dietary supplement firms don\u2019t need FDA clearance. Instead, companies vouch for the safety of dietary supplements and whether the products do what they say they will, and they don\u2019t have to share information with the FDA on how they make their determinations. The agency released rules in 2007 that dietary supplement makers are supposed to follow to ensure the products are made in sanitary conditions and will be of good quality when they hit store shelves. These rules are referred to as \u201ccurrent good manufacturing practices.\u201d The rules require dietary supplement firms to evaluate the purity, strength and composition of their products and the FDA can consider a pill adulterated if it doesn\u2019t contain the ingredients it\u2019s supposed to or is contaminated. The FDA\u2019s limited resources, particularly for dietary supplements, focus the agency\u2019s attention on products that contain hidden drug ingredients. Most often that includes sexual enhancement, weight loss and bodybuilding supplements. The FDA has warned just this year of more than two dozen products like Black Mamba Premium and Rhino Blitz Gold 3000 that contain the active ingredient in Pfizer Inc.\u2019s erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. The U.S. military pulled bodybuilding supplements from GNC stores on bases a few years ago for containing DMAA, a stimulant banned by sports leagues. The FDA has worked to get the ingredient off the market and warned it can cause a spike in blood pressure, which can lead to heart attack. GNC said on Monday that signs in stores and its website would now indicate whether a supplement product comes from whole herbs or extracts. It also will spotlight that extracts are chemicals derived from plants after applying solvents such as liquid carbon dioxide, the company said. DNA barcoding, meanwhile, will confirm the authenticity of plants used in the supplements, GNC said. Monday\u2019s accord also means GNC can restock shelves in New York following the lifting of a cease-and-desist order, Grom said. Herbal supplements represent about 10 percent of GNC\u2019s sales, he said. \u201cInvestors should be more confident that a fairly sizable chunk of the sales mix won\u2019t be negatively impacted going forward by regulators,\u201d Grom said.","timestamp":1427702756.0,"participant_ids":["GNC:US","WMT:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-30\/gnc-reaches-pact-with-new-york-a-g-products-in-full-compliance","subject":"GNC Reaches Accord With New York State on Herbal Supplements"},{"body":"     (Bloomberg) -- A newly issued patent awarded to Apple Inc. shows the company may come out with a mobile phone that can be folded and put into a pocket.  Patent 8,929,085, issued yesterday, covers what the Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker says is a flexible electronic device with internal components that allow it to be deformed, even to the extent of folding it. Apple said such flexibility might be extended to batteries, printer circuits, the housing itself and other components.  Flex features might be used to allow deformations of the device to provide inputs, Apple said. A user could turn a device on and off by twisting it, according to the patent.  A flexible device is also much less likely than a rigid one to break when dropped, Apple said.  The company applied for the patent in September 2011 with the assistance of the Treyz Law Group of San Francisco.  India\u2019s patent office rescinded a patent granted to Abbott Biotechnology Ltd. that covered its rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, following opposition was filed by the Mumbai-based generic-drug maker Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., India\u2019s Business Standard reported.  Hamilton, Bermuda-based Abbott was granted the patent in June 2009, despite Glenmark\u2019s having filed opposing papers in September 2008, according to the Business Standard.  After Glenmark\u2019s opposition came to the patent office\u2019s notice, it sent Abbott a cancellation letter, which was then stayed by the Delhi Court, the newspaper reported.  The court issued an order specifying that Glenmark\u2019s letter should be treated as a petition seeking review, after which the senior joint controller of patents and designs rescinded the patent, saying the invention was obvious and the patent\u2019s description of the process was insufficient, according to the Business Standard.

The U.S.-based Mondrian Trust, however, is insisting that under American law, while everything produced by the artist before 1923 is now copyright-free, his later work is covered by a rule specifying the copyright extends 95 years, rather than 70, after the artist\u2019s death, according to the news website.  The Dutch newspaper Trouw said that after discussions with the trust it now understands it can publish all of his work in the paper itself, but can post online only images not covered by the longer copyright term. U.S. residents might view the website, and having images still under copyright available to them would constitute infringement, DutchNews reported.

San Francisco-based Uber Technologies Inc., a provider of on-demand hired cars, has had five of its bases in New York City suspended for failing to provide electronic trip information for rides dispatched through the bases.  In a ruling handed down yesterday and obtained by New York Business Journal, the City of New York\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Tribunal rejected Uber\u2019s claims that such data is confidential, proprietary and protected as trade secrets. The rule requiring such disclosures is \u201clongstanding and the practice is necessary to ensure adequate protection and public safety,\u201d the commission said.  Uber argued that the demand for the records violates the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, according to the ruling.  The tribunal said that Uber failed to submit evidence which supported its defense, not calling witnesses or introduce documents supporting its claim that the information sought is proprietary or confidential.  The tribunal said it\u2019s not seeking every business document from Uber and \u201ccertainly nothing related to its training and retention process.\u201d The fact that in the past Uber did produce trip records \u201cseriously undercuts any present argument that this same information should be protected from disclosure as a trade secret.\u201d  Uber\u2019s licenses are suspended until the company comes into compliance with the tribunal\u2019s demands, according to the ruling.

Elkann needs to assure investors that his firm is ready to run a reinsurer as Turin, Italy-based Exor seeks to persuade PartnerRe shareholders to vote against a planned merger with Axis Capital Holdings Ltd. at a July 24 meeting. PartnerRe has been led by an interim CEO after the departure of Costas Miranthis in January, when the merger was announced. Axis CEO Albert Benchimol is the former chief financial officer of PartnerRe and has been designated to lead the combined company. He\u2019s said there will be opportunities to reduce expenses, an idea that has been challenged by Exor. \u201cThe company is a very good company as it is, and it can grow,\u201d Elkann said of PartnerRe. \u201cWe have absolutely no calculations in why we should be reducing headcount.\u201d He said that he\u2019s been unable so far to meet with top PartnerRe management because of the reinsurer\u2019s agreement with Axis. PartnerRe\u2019s former CEO Patrick Thiele said last week that an Exor deal would create more value and that Axis\u2019s cost-cutting plan could pressure sales. Reinsurers provide backup coverage to primary carriers. Thiele had contacted PartnerRe Chairman Jean-Paul L. Montupet in January to offer assistance during the transition. He then volunteered to help Elkann after the Italian firm made an unsolicited bid. Axis and PartnerRe, both based in Bermuda, seek to create the world\u2019s fifth-largest property-and-casualty reinsurer through a merger that would diversify risks. The added scale could help the company fend off competition from new rivals, including Wall Street investors who are seeking weather-related bets that are uncorrelated with financial markets. Exor, the investment firm of the billionaire Agnelli family, released revised offer terms Tuesday to allow the target company to solicit bids and negotiate with other potential buyers if it accepts Elkann\u2019s proposal. Exor also said it would lift the dividend rate on preferred shares by one percentage point and won\u2019t call three series of the securities until 2021. \u201cThese improvements only strengthen the company\u2019s probability of success in getting PartnerRe shareholders to vote against the merger with Axis,\u201d Charles Sebaski, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to investors.","timestamp":1436279065.0,"participant_ids":["PRE:US","EXO:IM","AXS:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-07\/elkann-plans-to-fill-partnerre-ceo-post-with-internal-promotion","subject":"Elkann Plans to Fill PartnerRe CEO Post With Internal Promotion"},{"body":" Sandell Asset Management Corp., the activist hedge-fund firm, amplified its criticism of PartnerRe Ltd. for shunning the unsolicited $6.8 billion takeover offer from Exor SpA that would break up the reinsurer\u2019s planned merger with Axis Capital Holdings Ltd. \u201cWe believe that the board is doing this in order to protect the Axis transaction, in disregard of the shareholders\u2019 best interests,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Thomas Sandell wrote to PartnerRe in a letter Thursday. \u201cWe find this action egregious\u00a0in today\u2019s corporate environment of increased shareholder engagement.\u201d PartnerRe shareholders are scheduled to vote July 24 on the planned merger with Axis, which would create the fifth-largest property-casualty reinsurer.

The latest proposal adds a special dividend of $3 a share, bringing the all-cash offer to $140.50 a share, Turin-based Exor said Monday in a statement. Exor Chairman John Elkann had offered $137.50 a share, or about $6.8 billion in May, and said that was his \u201clast offer.\u201d The bidding war is accelerating ahead of a PartnerRe shareholder vote that is scheduled for Aug. 7, after being postponed from July 24. Axis last week said it would allow PartnerRe holders to take a dividend of $17.50 a share before the planned merger of the Bermuda-based insurers. Exor said new terms compensate PartnerRe holders for delays in completing a transaction. The latest offer \u201cfurther widens the gap in value with the Axis transaction,\u201d Exor said in the statement. Elkann is seeking to diversify his investment company beyond industrial holdings such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. He is also chairman of the automaker.

Montupet\u2019s remarks reflect a shift for PartnerRe, which had repeated its commitment for weeks to complete a merger agreement with Axis Capital Holdings Ltd. to form the world\u2019s fifth-largest property-and-casualty reinsurer. Italy\u2019s Exor, led by the Agnelli family, has made two unsolicited bids as the investment firm seeks to diversify beyond industrial companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. PartnerRe has obtained a waiver from Axis allowing for direct engagement with Exor, according to Wednesday\u2019s statement. Exor Chairman John Elkann said last week that the $6.8 billion proposal, for $137.50 a share, was its final offer. An Exor spokesman declined to comment Wednesday. Exor rose 1.8 percent to 44.61 euros at 5:17 p.m. in Milan. PartnerRe was little changed at $134.11 in New York. Axis climbed 0.5 percent to $56.18. A spokesman for Axis didn\u2019t return a message seeking comment. Under the Axis agreement, PartnerRe shareholders would be entitled to about 51.5 percent of a combined company. A revised Axis deal, made after Exor\u2019s April 14 offer, also provided for a special dividend of $11.50 a share to PartnerRe investors. The revised agreement valued PartnerRe at about $126 a share, based on Bermuda-based Axis\u2019s May 1 closing price of $52.33. Axis said that joining companies would save costs and allow investors to benefit from a diversified insurer. The PartnerRe agreement was the product of a \u201cflawed process\u201d that failed to explore alternatives, Exor said in a May 4 statement. When Exor increased its offer on May 12, the company said it had acquired a PartnerRe stake of more than 9 and would encourage PartnerRe shareholders to reject an Axis transaction. \u201cAlthough we were disappointed that Exor has made misleading statements regarding our prior discussions, we are interested in a proposal that may lead to superior value,\u201d PartnerRe\u2019s Montupet said. In addition to a higher price, PartnerRe is seeking assurances that Exor can complete a deal and protection if an eventual agreement collapses, according to two people with knowledge of the target company\u2019s planning. A transaction could be reviewed by regulators in jurisdictions including the U.S., U.K., Hong Kong and Ireland, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. PartnerRe is being led by interim Chief Executive Officer David Zwiener after the departure of Costas Miranthis on the day the Axis deal was announced in January. The breakup fee for the Axis-PartnerRe deal is $280 million, according to a May 7 regulatory filing. Reinsurers have been seeking merger partners amid competition from pension and hedge funds that have been pursuing weather-related bets that aren\u2019t correlated with bond and stock markets.

The Toronto-based banks will oversee the sale of 15 percent of Hydro One in an IPO worth as much as C$2.25 billion ($1.82 billion). That would be Canada\u2019s largest IPO since the C$2.49 billion sale by Manulife Financial Corp. in 1999. The sale will add to a surge in IPOS this year, bolstering advisory fees for Canadian lenders. Companies that have gone public or announced plans to sell shares include Ottawa-based Shopify Inc., Stingray Digital Group Inc. and Shred-it International Inc. Ontario invited Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and Canada\u2019s six biggest banks in   to pitch for a role in arranging the Hydro One IPO. Royal Bank is Canada\u2019s biggest lender by assets, while Scotiabank ranks third. The fees for the bookrunners will be 1 percent for institutional investors and 3 percent for retail buyers, \u201csignificantly lower than industry norms,\u201d the energy ministry said in a statement Wednesday. Investment banks typically get about 5 percent of the amount raised in IPOs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Scotiabank was Canada\u2019s top arranger of equity financings last year followed by RBC, according to Bloomberg data. RBC ranks No. 1 for arranging stock sales this year, with Scotiabank in fourth, the data show. Denis Desautels, former auditor general of Canada, reviewed the selection process to ensure fairness, the government said. Desautels was hired as a special adviser in May to identify potential conflicts of interest and assess criteria used to choose the banks. Ed Clark, the former Toronto-Dominion Bank chief executive officer, oversees a group advising Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne on asset sales including Hydro One. That advisory council has also tapped retired RBC Capital Markets investment banker Alan Hibben. The government on April 16 named David Denison, a Royal Bank board member and former CEO of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, as chairman of Hydro One to lead the company through the IPO. \u201cIt just seems like there\u2019s a whole group of people on Bay Street that have become significant in government decision-making, and this is another expression of that,\u201d said Peter Tabuns, energy critic for the New Democratic Party, which opposes the sale. \u201cEven with Denis Desautels in place, it doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d RBC Capital Markets spokeswoman Gillian McArdle declined to comment. \u201cThe Premier\u2019s advisory council on government assets is advising the government on the IPO process, however none of the council members had a role in the selection of the active bookrunners,\u201d minister of energy spokeswoman Jennifer Beaudry said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cThe government used a rigorous selection process and a review panel comprised of government officials and independent experts.\u201d Desautels oversaw the process and found it fair, Beaudry said.

PartnerRe shareholders will own 51.6 percent of the new insurer, and the company declined in New York trading while Axis advanced. The combined entity will be among the world\u2019s five largest reinsurers, with more than $10 billion in policy sales, according to a statement late Sunday in New York. Invested assets and cash will be more than $33 billion. The transaction \u201cwill leverage the complementary strengths of both companies,\u201d Axis Capital Chief Executive Officer Albert A. Benchimol, who will serve as CEO of the combined firm, said in the statement. The deal will \u201ccreate an organization with the size and breadth to enhance product and service offerings, maximize growth opportunities, optimize portfolios and deliver both economies of scale and capital efficiencies.\u201d Traditional reinsurers have been seeking deals to diversify offerings and gain scale amid increased competition from hedge funds and other investors pushing into their market. XL Group Plc agreed   to buy Catlin Group Ltd., a Lloyd\u2019s of London company, for about $4.2 billion. RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. struck a deal in   to purchase Platinum Underwriters Holdings Ltd.

Shanker said investors generally think that PartnerRe has set aside more funds than Axis to guard against future losses. \u201cThe terms of the deal do not seem to acknowledge a difference between Axis\u2019s and PartnerRe\u2019s potential for redundancy\u201d of reserves, he wrote. Reinsurers take on risks initiated by primary carriers. They have also been seeking to add specialty offerings for commercial clients. Combining will help Axis and PartnerRe compete with larger rivals like Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Munich Re and Swiss Re AG. Together, Axis and PartnerRe would be the No. 5 seller of property-casualty reinsurance by gross premiums, according to a presentation Monday. The merged firm also will sell specialty policies to businesses, as well as life and accident-and-health coverage. The deal will lead to at least $200 million of annual cost savings before tax within the first 18 months of operations, the pair said. The transaction will help the new company expand in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, Benchimol said on a conference call on Monday. Competition and a glut of money in the industry has pushed down reinsurance prices and eaten into providers\u2019 margins. Rates for property-catastrophe coverage fell 11 percent for policies that renewed on Jan. 1, a major date for arranging the coverage, according to Guy Carpenter, a division of Marsh & McLennan Cos. Rival broker Aon Plc said this month that reinsurer capital reached a record $575 billion at the end of the third quarter. Ace Ltd. CEO Evan Greenberg predicted in October that those those trends would lead to a \u201cfrenzy\u201d of mergers and takeovers in the industry as companies try to keep from shrinking. \u201cIn the current competitive market, size, scale and breadth are more important than ever,\u201d PartnerRe Chairman Jean-Paul L. Montupet said on a conference call with investors on Monday. \u201cWe will be better positioned to compete and excel in this evolving new global marketplace as a combined entity.\u201d Axis Capital was founded by Marsh & McLennan and began operations in 2001 after the industry was shaken by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Its Axis Re Ventures unit helps investors bet on weather risks through securities such as catastrophe bonds. PartnerRe, formed in 1993 after claims from Hurricane Andrew pressured established insurers, provides catastrophe coverage and also guards against risks in industries including agriculture, aviation and energy. The company expanded with the 2009 purchase of Paris Re Holdings Ltd. and backed Essent Group Ltd., the mortgage insurer that had a public offering in 2013. The company this month announced the establishment of PartnerRe Asia after winning a license from regulators in Singapore. Benchimol worked for PartnerRe for about a decade as chief financial officer until stepping down in 2010 a few months before Costas Miranthis was set to become CEO. Benchimol soon joined Axis Capital as finance chief, later becoming its CEO. Miranthis is now stepping down from that post at PartnerRe and leaving its board as of Sunday. Another director, David Zwiener, will serve as interim CEO until the deal\u2019s expected completion in the second half of this year, the companies said. Seven directors from each company will constitute the combined firm\u2019s board, with PartnerRe Chairman Montupet serving as non-executive chairman. Axis Capital Chairman Michael A. Butt will become chairman emeritus. PartnerRe investors will get 2.18 shares of the combined company for each of their shares. The ratio will be one-to-one for Axis shareholders.

While Winterkorn was pressured to step down as VW\u2019s CEO last week, he remains in the top executive job at Porsche Automobil Holding SE, which owns 52.2 percent of the automaker\u2019s voting stock. He\u2019s also still   of VW\u2019s publicly traded Audi AG unit as well as the group\u2019s truck holding company, among other positions. His continued role is a contentious issue especially for labor leaders, said people familiar with the issue. It also raises questions about whether VW can truly reform itself with old-guard insiders in key positions. \u201cIt shows that modern corporate governance doesn\u2019t play a role at Volkswagen,\u201d\u00a0said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. \u201cThey need someone independent at the main shareholder. The VW CEO is going to say the company is doing great.\u201d VW representatives didn\u2019t respond to e-mails and phone calls requesting comment on the company\u2019s corporate governance.\u00a0A spokesman for Volkswagen couldn\u2019t immediately comment on Winterkorn\u2019s other positions within the group. A spokesman for Porsche Holding confirmed that Winterkorn remains CEO and declined to comment on his future in the role. Volkswagen\u2019s unusual structure stems from the partial takeover of the automaker by Porsche last decade. The company, owned by the descendants of VW Beetle creator Ferdinand Porsche, failed to completely acquire Volkswagen and ended up selling the Porsche sports-car brand to the Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker after running into financial issues. Winterkorn then became CEO of both Volkswagen and its majority shareholder. Winterkorn resigned as VW\u2019s CEO on Wednesday. When Porsche Holding\u2019s supervisory board met the next day, he neither stepped down nor was he removed from his positions at that company. That was before Friday\u2019s meeting of Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board, when documents from four years ago were presented that flagged the illegal software, said one person familiar with the meeting. Those documents were never acted upon at the time. While Mueller pushed Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board on Friday to sign off on a reorganization\u00a0aimed at streamlining decision-making, that plan was put together while Winterkorn was at the helm. More contentious issues including potential criminal prosecution for individual executives remain. Volkswagen is still scrambling to figure out what to do with 11 million VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat vehicles that have rigged diesel engines. Germany has demanded a solution by Oct. 7 or it might move to take the cars off the roads. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron refused to rule out the country following Switzerland with banning sales of Volkswagen\u2019s diesel vehicles. In Spain, company officials face fraud allegations. Prosecutors in Braunschweig, Germany, on Monday opened a criminal investigation of Winterkorn over allegations of fraud related to diesel engines that sought to fool regulators and consumers by turning on full pollution controls only during tests. The company has also filed a complaint with prosecutors to seek their assistance in the probe. While Volkswagen has already set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) for repairs and other expenses, the full costs are still being tallied. Max Warburton, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd., estimates the fine for from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at as much as $7.4 billion, adding that the costs could force VW to sell new shares. \u201cIf the cash costs exceed 10 billion euros, a capital raise is highly likely,\u201d said Warburton in a note. \u201cThis is not a normal situation.\u201d\u00a0","timestamp":1443432283.0,"participant_ids":["VOW:GR","PAH3:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-28\/volkswagen-s-cleanup-push-overseen-by-scandal-scarred-former-ceo","subject":"Winterkorn Isn't Completely Out at VW"},{"body":"German prosecutors said that former Porsche SE Chief Financial Officer Holger Haerter effectively admitted\u00a0last week that he was guilty of market manipulation ahead of a failed attempt to take over Volkswagen AG. In his opening statement on the first day of the trial, Haerter conceded that he was worried in October 2008 about the cost of Volkswagen shares and the financial risks for Porsche, prosecutor Heiko Wagenpfeil told a Stuttgart court on Thursday. When Porsche finally said it was considering a bid for VW, these concerns weren\u2019t disclosed to the market,\u00a0Wagenpfeil said. Haerter and ex-Porsche Chief Executive Officer Wendelin Wiedeking are accused of manipulating VW shares with six statements in 2008. The last one, issued on Oct. 26 of that year, stated that Porsche controlled 74.1 percent of VW, partly through options, and was seeking a 75 percent stake. The announcement caused Volkswagen\u2019s stock to jump as short sellers raced to buy shares to repay borrowed stock in bets that VW would fall. The short squeeze led to regulatory probes and law suits filed by hedge funds seeking about about 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in German civil courts. \"Porsche claimed at the time it was disclosing the information to help short sellers sort their positions,\" said Wagenpfeil. \"But Porsche didn\u2019t disclose its own conflicting interests. From Mr. Haerter\u2019s own statement you can already derive that the market was manipulated.\" Prosecutors say\u00a0Haerter and\u00a0Wiedeking misled the markets when they denied through much of 2008 that Porsche was seeking to buy VW. The two men say they only decided to acquire control of VW on Oct. 26. Haerter\u2019s lawyer, Sven Thomas, said prosecutors apparently dropped their previous theory that the Oct. 26 release was deceptive, moving to yet another attempt to give unfounded charges credibility. The first witness in the case, an officer of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg\u2019s crime office who led the police investigations, said there were numerous indications that Porsche\u2019s leaders planned to take over VW long before 2008. The man, \u00a0who can only be identified as Siegfried L., cited fee arrangements with banks dating from 2007 that showed Porsche hired them to give advice on how to acquire 75 percent of Volkswagen. These documents prompted investigators to raid lenders in 2010, he said. As of September 2008, Porsche together with the then-independent Porsche Holding GmbH controlled more than 76 percent of VW, if you include options held by both of them, said Siegfried L.\u00a0 Salzburg-based Porsche Holding GmbH was at the time a separate company but also owned by the Porsche and Piech families. \"Looking at the overall picture, I\u2019m convinced that the plan was long decided on by the men before the formal decisions were taken,\" said Siegfried L.","timestamp":1446109554.0,"participant_ids":["PAH3:GR","VOW:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-29\/ex-porsche-cfo-admitted-manipulation-prosecutor-tells-court","subject":"Ex-Porsche CFO Admitted Manipulation, Prosecutor Tells Court"},{"body":"Porsche SE\u2019s failed bid to take over Volkswagen AG in 2008 faced hurdles in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\u2019s bankruptcy in September of that year, a police investigator told a Stuttgart court Friday. Four banks that Porsche had asked for a 20 billion-euro ($22 billion) loan to finance the potential bid said that the plan to acquire a 75-percent stake in VW was unrealistic in light of the Lehman crisis, according to the investigator. Mounting debt obligations under the options the sports-car maker used to acquire VW shares also played a role when Porsche finally announced it was considering a bid, she said.\u00a0 \"Porsche had significant liquidity problems in the week before the statement,\" said the investigator, who can only be identified as Doerte S. \"Financial issues played a role, Porsche knew it wouldn\u2019t get any additional financing.\" \u00a0 Ex-Porsche Chief Financial Officer Holger Haerter and ex-Chief Executive Officer Wendelin Wiedeking are accused of manipulating VW shares with six statements in 2008. Five times they denied they were seeking to acquire VW. The sixth one, issued on Oct. 26 of that year, stated that Porsche controlled 74.1 percent of VW, partly through options, and was seeking the 75 percent stake necessary for a full takeover under German law. The takeover plan backfired spectacularly in the wake of the financial crisis, drying up loans that Wiedeking and Haerter needed to finance the deal. The bid collapsed and Porsche itself had to be rescued by VW, which bought Porsche\u2019s manufacturing operations, leaving behind only a holding company with the sports-car maker\u2019s legendary name. The Oct. 26, 2008, announcement caused Volkswagen\u2019s stock to jump as short sellers raced to buy shares to repay\u00a0stock borrowed in bets that VW would fall. The short squeeze led to regulatory probes and lawsuits filed by hedge funds seeking Client about 5 billion euros in German civil courts. Prosecutors claim Porsche should have disclosed its conflicting financial interests in the statement. The structure of the options was causing problems for the Porsche officials in the weeks before the Oct. 26 announcement as VW shares fell, driving up the cost of the financial instruments, the investigator said. In the week before the October statement, Maple Bank GmbH, which had provided the options, sought payments of 845 million euros, then 650 million euros and finally another 700 million euros because of the sinking price of VW shares, according to the police officer. Porsche had to sell stock it held in other companies to raise cash, the investigator said. In mid-2008, Porsche had securities worth 4 billion euros. By October 2008, only about 1 billion euros was left, she said. Haerter\u2019s lawyers said Porsche had no difficulty meeting those obligations and Maple also had to pay Porsche under the options program. \"You cannot call it liquidity problems, if the payment obligations are actually complied with,\" said Sven Thomas, one of his attorneys. The investigator said that whether or not Porsche met the payments deadlines that week, the risks included those the company would face in the near future. \"With the threat that the VW shares would continue to fall, the week ahead would have looked doomed for Porsche,\" Doerte S. said. When questioned by Porsche\u2019s lawyer Daniel Krause, the witness said there was no written evidence the company\u2019s managers expected shares would fall the next week. Krause said an e-mail from the period pointed to the opposite conclusion.","timestamp":1446205147.0,"participant_ids":["VOW:GR","PAH3:GR","LEHMQ:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-30\/lehman-bankruptcy-early-sign-of-trouble-for-porsche-s-vw-bid","subject":"Lehman Bankruptcy Early Sign of Trouble for Porsche's VW Bid"},{"body":" Two of New York\u2019s most prominent real estate developers are teaming up on a building for WeWork Cos. at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the office-sharing company\u2019s first ground-up project. Boston Properties Inc. and Rudin Management Co. plan a 675,000-square-foot (63,000-square-meter) property that will offer unobstructed views of the Manhattan skyline, to be built on a strip of land jutting into Wallabout Bay between two dry docks. The $380 million project, set to be unveiled Monday, will be the first in Brooklyn for both Boston Properties, the largest U.S. office real estate investment trust, and Rudin, a family-owned company that\u2019s marking its 110th year in business. The foray by the developers is a testament to Brooklyn\u2019s strength as an emerging  , with growing demand from young media and technology companies whose employees largely live in the borough. The project would extend a New York leasing spree for WeWork, a five-year-old provider of collaborative workspace that raised financing last month at a $10 billion  . WeWork\u2019s plan and other initiatives at the yard tell an \u201cextraordinary story about the strength of the innovation economy in New York,\u201d Alicia Glen, deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said in an interview. \u201cBy having WeWork there, and having that sort of youthful entrepreneurial energy atop what\u2019s already going on there, it\u2019s like the perfect recipe for more and greater companies growing and expanding in New York City.\u201d WeWork has leased about 1.65 million square feet of offices since the start of 2011, or more than half the office space at 1 World Trade Center, according to research firm CompStak Inc. On its  , WeWork lists 15 Manhattan locations and one in Brooklyn\u2019s Dumbo section. The company oversaw the design of the Navy Yard building, in which it will take 222,000 square feet, according to a statement from the development partners. Construction is set to start late this year and be completed in 2017. The design firm S9 Architecture has incorporated many of the trendy features that have drawn tech tenants to refurbished factories in Manhattan, Chicago and San Francisco, including 14-foot (4.3-meter) ceilings and open offices designed to encourage interaction. Plans also call for specialty food vendors, a massage room, valet bicycle parking, outdoor terraces, a rooftop conference center and a basketball court that would be open to all Navy Yard workers. WeWork is \u201ccreating an environment that we think is the future of real estate,\u201d said William Rudin, Rudin Management\u2019s chief executive officer. Rudin and Mort Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties, whose signature assets include Manhattan\u2019s General Motors Building, were early investors in WeWork, contributing personal funds rather than corporate money. Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s CEO, said the company sometimes faces limitations in the buildings it leases because it didn\u2019t play a role in their design. He developed the idea for the building at the Navy Yard after he toured the property and was impressed by its combination of offices and light manufacturing. He then chose the developers. \u201cWe got to design this from bottom up, which means that everything about it is built to foster collaboration,\u201d said Neumann, who co-founded the company in Manhattan\u2019s Soho section in 2010. \u201cThere is nothing like this building built in the world today. Everything from where the elevators are located to how big is the cafeteria.\u201d Neumann said he sees the building as a model for WeWork developments across the country, including three more in the New York area, plus San Francisco, Miami and London. The Brooklyn project\u2019s developers, equal partners in their joint venture, will seek rents of at least $60 a square foot, said John Powers, Boston Properties\u2019 New York regional manager. The average in nearby Dumbo, the neighborhood between the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges that commands the borough\u2019s highest office rents, is $62.42 a square foot, according to brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. \u201cThis will be the highest-end product in the tech market in New York,\u201d Powers said. The project is the second-largest at the Navy Yard since the city acquired the 300-acre (121-hectare) property from the Defense Department in 1966. Only the Steiner Studios film-production facility, opened in 2004, was bigger. The construction is a key part of a plan to bring jobs back to the yard, which lost 12,000 positions when the Navy moved out, said David Ehrenberg, who runs the property. The new building will support about 4,000 workers when it\u2019s operating fully, he said. Under an agreement with the city, tenants must pay all their employees a living wage of at least $13.30 an hour, according to Powers. The state minimum wage will be $9 as of the end of this year. The partners have been watching the evolution of real estate in Brooklyn for a long time, Rudin and Powers said. While in New York, Boston Properties is known for its Midtown skyscrapers housing mostly law and securities firms, \u201cwe have tech in our DNA, going back from our first building,\u201d in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Powers said. \u201cWe\u2019re the biggest landlord in Cambridge,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of our big markets is San Francisco. We have a portfolio that has a high percentage in tech.

Wolfgang Porsche, 71, chairman of the family\u2019s holding company, opposed his 78-year-old cousin\u2019s effort to oust Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn. Both Wolfgang Porsche and Winterkorn are now in line to potentially replace Piech. The chairman role is being filled temporarily by IG Metall union official Berthold Huber. With divisions in the Porsche-Piech clan, whose 50.7 percent holding of VW common stock is valued at about 13.7 billion euros ($14.9 billion), finding a candidate that\u2019s acceptable to labor leaders, its home state and shareholder Lower Saxony as well as factions within the family may be a struggle. And Piech still has sway. \u201cIt remains to be seen how the dispute within the family pans out,\u201d Daniel Schwarz, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG, said by phone. \u201cPiech can still block some decisions.\u201d In addition to Winterkorn and Wolfgang Porsche, a neutral candidate may also be Wolfgang Reitzle, chairman of German auto-parts maker Continental AG, newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported. VW\u2019s supervisory board is due to meet May 4, a day before its shareholders\u2019 meeting. A decision on a successor won\u2019t be made by next week\u2019s gathering as the company\u2019s under no time pressure to act, Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil said in an interview with newspaper   published on Tuesday. \u201cThe board and the management are totally capable of functioning,\u201d said Weil. \u201cThe board\u2019s executive committee plans to approach this calmly.\u201d Piech remains a board member of the family\u2019s investment vehicle Porsche Automobil Holding SE. He can also exert influence within the family, which has agreements in place to vote as a bloc. That means he could hold up discussions on a successor, said a person familiar with the family\u2019s structure. None of the family representatives would comment on succession. Piech\u2019s power stems from a holding of about 13 percent of Porsche SE common stock, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. If he seeks to sell those shares, he\u2019d have to offer them to other family members first. That would mean the clan -- which has about 35 members, including Piech\u2019s 12 children -- would have to come up with about 1.8 billion euros to buy him out, based on prices for Porsche SE\u2019s publicly traded, non-voting preferred shares. The family appears prepared to ensure there\u2019s no disruption in the shareholding structure. \u201cWith great loyalty to the Volkswagen group and its 600,000 employees, we will continue to stand by our responsibility as principal shareholder,\u201d Wolfgang Porsche said in a statement issued by the holding company. The Porsche-Piech clan, all descendants of VW Beetle creator Ferdinand Porsche, has weathered such disruptions in the past. In the 1980s, when Piech\u2019s older brother Ernst wanted to sell his shares to Arab investors, the families banded together to buy him out. Because of that, the Porsche part of the family owns slightly more than the Piech side. Still, loyalties between the members are not determined by last names. In 2009, when Porsche SE\u2019s planned takeover of Volkswagen faltered because of ballooning debt, the families turned to Qatar to help bail them out, selling a 10 percent stake in Porsche SE\u2019s voting shares. The family   that holding in 2013. To seal such deals, the family often gathers in small villages along the Austrian-German border. Prior to buying back the Qatar stake, they met, for instance, in Mattsee, a small town near Salzburg where Ernst Piech opened an   of Ferdinand Porsche\u2019s pioneering developments such as the first hybrid car. Feuds have been part of such gatherings. In the early 1970s, there was so much dissent that that family decided to withdraw from operational positions at Porsche. That caused Piech to leave the company, where he had developed the legendary Porsche 917 race car, to start his career at Volkswagen by joining Audi in 1972. Wolfgang Porsche and Ferdinand Piech ended up on opposite sides during the VW-Porsche takeover battle. Piech won that fight, and Volkswagen bought the Porsche sports-car brand as well as the families\u2019 Austrian car-dealership group. The spat between the cousins culminated in a tearful speech by Wolfgang to the makers of the 911 sports car on a rain-soaked day in Stuttgart, Germany, where he said goodbye to Porsche boss Wendelin Wiedeking, whom Piech had forced aside. This time, Wolfgang, who runs a   in the Austrian Alps, got the upper hand. But those tensions will still play out as the family grapples with the future of Volkswagen\u2019s leadership.","timestamp":1430161260.0,"participant_ids":["VOW:GR","PAH3:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-27\/porsche-piech-clan-rift-sets-up-scramble-to-fill-vw-power-vacuum","subject":"Porsche-Piech Clan Rift Sets Up Scramble to Fill VW Vacuum"},{"body":" An Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc. venture completed the acquisition of a Manhattan tower from Blackstone Group LP for $2.2 billion, the largest transaction for a single U.S. office building since 2008.

That, we knew. What we didn\u2019t know, until now, is that the investment included $5 million from Admiral Capital Group, the private equity fund co-founded by former NBA MVP David Robinson, according to a person with knowledge of the investment.

As with the travel site that resurrected William Shatner, buyers give up a fair bit of control. Bidders can choose a general area of an arena where they\u2019d like to sit but can\u2019t get as specific as section, row or seat. If a bid is accepted, the buyer\u2019s card is charged. In exchange, fans get discounts. A recent search for tickets to see the New York Islanders play the New Jersey Devils at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn turned up two $86 seats for $25 each. Like other sites, ScoreBig sells tickets held by brokers. Unlike others, it also pitches itself as a partner to teams and venues. It wants major-league teams to funnel their unsold tickets through ScoreBig. Some 370 million event tickets go unsold each year, ScoreBig estimates. Empty seats don\u2019t drink beer, buy thunder sticks or add to a franchise\u2019s customer database. The game has to go on regardless, but filling a seat is worth an estimated average of $20 in food, beverage and merchandise, said Scott O\u2019Neil, Chief Executive Officer of the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils, who is also a ScoreBig board member. Companies like StubHub and SeatGeek predominantly sell tickets on what\u2019s called the secondary market -- the tickets have already been sold by the team and are being resold by the holder, often at a markup. ScoreBig can sell tickets it receives directly from the teams, and share the revenue, without upsetting customers like season-ticket holders or anyone else who paid full price. ScoreBig Chief Executive Officer David Goldberg wouldn\u2019t say how many teams in the major U.S. sports are working with ScoreBig, which sees itself filling a gap in the current ticket market. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got long legs and want to sit on the aisle, then, guess what, you should be paying full price retail or secondary market,\u201d Goldberg said.","timestamp":1450434600.0,"participant_ids":["0617887D:US","PCLN:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-18\/nba-s-admiral-said-to-invest-5-million-in-priceline-of-tickets","subject":"NBA's Admiral Said to Invest $5 Million in Priceline of Tickets"},{"body":"Toronto-Dominion Bank Chief Executive Officer Bharat Masrani said he\u2019s interested in buying more credit-card loans and would consider \u201ctuck-in\" takeovers in the U.S. Southeast to build up the lender\u2019s U.S. retail branch network. Canada\u2019s largest lender by assets has bought about C$20 billion ($14.6 billion) of credit-card assets in Canada and the U.S. in the past four years, including $2.2 billion of credit-card receivables from Nordstrom Inc. in October.

The U.S.-based TD Bank consumer lender has 1,298 branches stretching from Maine to Florida, with Georgia the only state along the Eastern Seaboard without a presence. \u201cThere are pockets out there that perhaps we may not have, but we\u2019re working on those,\" Masrani said. \"We don\u2019t need to do an acquisition for that purpose.\" Toronto-Dominion under Masrani\u2019s predecessor, Ed Clark, spent about $17 billion over a decade building a U.S. branch network that rivaled its Canadian branch presence. Toronto-Dominion expanded under Clark with U.S. acquisitions, starting with its 2005 purchase of 51 percent of Portland, Maine-based Banknorth Group Inc. The firm expanded to the U.S. Southeast in 2010 by acquiring South Financial Group Inc. and three Florida-based banks. If Toronto-Dominion sees a \"compelling opportunity\" that makes sense strategically and culturally, which helps the branch network, and the bank could get a \"reasonable deal,\" he\u2019d certainly look at it, Masrani said in the interview. \"The southeast of the United States is particularly attractive in that regard,\" Masrani said, adding that Florida has proved to be a \u201cvery good business\u201d after spending the last few years expanding from seven branches to 157 today. \u201cWe keep on adding to it organically, but if a small tuck-in were to show up like South Financial, which we bought during the financial crisis, then we\u2019d certainly look at it seriously, because that would accelerate our organic plans quite dramatically,\" Masrani said. Toronto-Dominion is focusing in the meantime on opening more branches across its U.S. footprint to gain scale where it\u2019s most needed, Masrani said. The bank opens about 30 branches in the U.S. every year. High-growth markets such as New York City, Boston and Philadelphia have seen a \u201chuge uptick,\" Masrani said in an interview with Pamela Ritchie for Bloomberg TV Canada.

The $1.4 billion financing will pay down a mortgage taken on by Tishman Speyer when the real estate company bought the building from MetLife Inc. for $1.72 billion in 2005, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren\u2019t public. The banks plan to slice the 10-year debt into bonds and sell them to investors, Suzanne Halpin, a spokeswoman for Tishman Speyer, said in an e-mailed statement, without disclosing terms. The 58-story skyscraper, owned by Pan American World Airways when it was completed in 1963, sits over Park Avenue and Grand Central Terminal with the MetLife name across the top. A $3 billion value would make it one of the most expensive office buildings in New York. Manhattan\u2019s General Motors Building set a record for a U.S. tower after a minority stake in the property was sold in 2013, valuing it at $3.4 billion, according to property-research firm Real Capital Analytics Inc. Zia Ahmed, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, and Jen Hibbard, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, declined to comment. On a per-square-foot basis, the valuation of about $1,000 a square foot is comparable to recent transactions for top-tier Manhattan towers, according to Real Capital. Other deals have been higher: Canada\u2019s Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc. last month bought 1095 Avenue of the Americas for $2.2 billion, or about $2,136 a square foot, Real Capital data show. Commercial-property values in New York are soaring to records as cash from around the globe floods the city in search of a safe haven and higher yields. Low interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to stimulate economic growth have helped fuel a recovery in U.S real estate that has lifted prices on top-tier properties in big cities 17 percent above peaks reached in November 2007, according to an index from Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Real Capital. Lenders this year have arranged a total of about $5.4 billion of securities tied to individual loans as of Feb. 4, outpacing the tally at the same time in 2014, according to Jefferies Group LLC. Such deals, which are too large to be packaged together with other loans, are often linked to a single trophy asset like the MetLife Building.","timestamp":1424960477.0,"participant_ids":["MET:US","0008959D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-26\/nyc-s-metlife-tower-said-in-1-4-billion-refinancing-deal","subject":"NYC\u2019s MetLife Tower Said in $1.4 Billion Refinancing Deal"},{"body":" It took almost a decade and a half for MetLife Inc. to determine that Manhattan\u2019s MetLife Building was where it belonged. The biggest U.S. life insurer said Wednesday it will consolidate its New York operations into 200 Park Ave., which gained fame in the 1960s as the Pan Am Building before Pan American World Airways Inc. went bankrupt about 30 years later. MetLife bought it in 1980, then replaced the Pan Am sign at the top with its own in 1993 after the airline\u2019s demise. The company had offices there and locations including 1 Madison Ave. in 2001, when Mayor Rudy Giuliani persuaded the company to move more than 900 jobs from Manhattan to a onetime Rolls-Royce factory just across the Queensboro Bridge in Long Island City, in an incentive-laden effort to develop a satellite business district there. That was followed about four years later by the sale of the MetLife Building to a group led by Tishman Speyer, and a decision to move most of the Queens staff to another Midtown tower a year later. By the time MetLife decided to consolidate at the MetLife Building, it had only about 110,000 square feet (10,200 square meters) in the 3 million-square-foot tower, housing its executive offices and boardroom. \u201cThe decision to go there in the first place was probably a very good decision,\u201d said Barry Gosin, chief executive officer at Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, a New York-based real estate brokerage. \u201cSometimes we go in a complete 360. This is a classic example of a 360\u201d degree turn \u201cback to when that decision was made.\u201d The MetLife tower sits astride Grand Central Terminal, giving it unbeatable transportation connections, Gosin said. \u201cYou can get everywhere from that location,\u201d he said. MetLife signed a 12-year lease in a deal that will give it about 530,000 square feet, mostly at the base of the 58-story tower. Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian, who has been closing locations to cut costs, will be consolidating employees into one property from four. The moves are to be completed by 2017, the insurer said. Among the properties it will leave is 1095 Avenue of the Americas, where it has about 492,000 square feet, according to data from CoStar Group Inc., a Washington-based research firm that tracks office leasing. That building was   two months ago to a partnership led by Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., the real estate arm of Canadian pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, for $2.2 billion. MetLife, along with Verizon Communications Inc., are currently the main tenants at the 1.2 million-square-foot tower, also known as 3 Bryant Park. MetLife gave back $5 million of the $26.4 million of city incentives it received to move to Queens when it leased space at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in 2006. The move from Long Island City was \u201cimportant\u201d to MetLife\u2019s stature as a major life insurance company, John Calagna, a spokesman for the insurer, said at the time. Calagna on Wednesday declined to discuss the implications of MetLife\u2019s return to the tower it once owned. When the company bought the tower in 1980, it was purely as an investment, and MetLife had no offices there at the time, Calagna said. MetLife has three leases for space in the Bryant Park building, all expiring in 2029, giving it the option of subleasing those offices or negotiating a termination with the new owners. Calagna said the company intends to sublease its space at 3 Bryant and in Long Island City. Sebastien Theberge, an Ivanhoe spokesman, said in an e-mail that MetLife remains under a long-term lease at the property. Ivanhoe doesn\u2019t comment in public on lease details, he said. Bud Perrone, a Tishman Speyer spokesman, also declined to comment. If MetLife\u2019s Bryant Park space becomes available, it could attract a premium rent, said Chris Peckholdt, assistant director of Landauer Valuation & Advisory, an appraisal division of Newmark, who recently conducted a study of office space surrounding the park. Office space in the building would lease for roughly $100 a square foot, about 12 percent higher than similar space \u201cnear the park but not on the park,\u201d he said in an interview. The MetLife Building space is \u201cprobably cost-effective compared to the other options out there,\u201d said Stephen Siegel, global brokerage chairman at CBRE Group Inc., who has represented MetLife in the past. \u201cAnd their name\u2019s on the roof, so it kind of makes a lot of sense.\u201d","timestamp":1426730462.0,"participant_ids":["MET:US","2133420Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-19\/metlife-circles-back-to-manhattan-tower-it-mostly-left","subject":"MetLife Circles Back to Manhattan Tower It Mostly Left"},{"body":"HomeAway Inc. shares soared 25 percent after Expedia Inc. agreed to acquire the vacation-rental company for $3.9 billion, and investors speculated the bid may prompt a counteroffer from another rival such as Priceline Group Inc. Expedia will pay $38.31 a share for HomeAway,\u00a0the companies said in a statement after the close of trading on Wednesday. That\u2019s 20 percent higher than Austin, Texas-based HomeAway\u2019s price before the deal was announced. The stock rose to $40.15 on Thursday in New York, and Expedia shares jumped 2.3 percent to $137.31. With HomeAway shares surging even higher than the offer, Cowen & Co. analyst Kevin Kopelman said a competing bid was \u201cnot out of the question.\u201d He cited Priceline and Airbnb Inc. as potential suitors. A spokeswoman for Priceline, Expedia\u2019s biggest competitor in the online travel industry, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Airbnb and other startups are changing the dynamics of the travel market by adding new capacity that competes with lodging operators and isn\u2019t directly searchable by websites such as Expedia. That\u2019s motivated them to respond by offering their own services that are based on people renting out their rooms and homes. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a product that\u2019s important for a certain group of people, so we will look to build out our rental product over time.\u201d Expedia\u00a0Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi told analysts on a conference call last week, during the company\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings report. \"Incrementally, it will become a more important part of our mix next year and going into the following years.\" Expedia has had a partnership with HomeAway for two years, Khosrowshahi said in Wednesday\u2019s statement.\u00a0A year ago, the\u00a0Bellevue, Washington-based company struck a deal to list 115,000 HomeAway vacation listings on its travel search engine.\u00a0 Bringing HomeAway into Expedia\u2019s portfolio of brands \u201cis a logical next step,\u201d Khosrowshahi said.

Chris Lehane, a former White House crisis manager known as the \u201cmaster of disaster,\u201d holds the bland title of global policy chief. But he\u2019s already enmeshed in a regulatory dustup in Airbnb\u2019s hometown of San Francisco. On Nov. 3, voters will be asked to approve Proposition F, which among other things would impose a 75-day-per-year limit on Airbnb rentals and force hosts to register with the city. From Airbnb\u2019s headquarters in the startup-studded South of Market district, Lehane is helping orchestrate an $8 million campaign to defeat the ballot initiative.\u00a0He\u2019s up against deeply committed opponents, who see\u00a0Prop F as a proxy battle in a wider war against the perceived arrogance of the tech industry, which has been accused of turning San Francisco into a gated community.\u00a0In recent days, Airbnb played into that stereotype with ads exhorting the city to use money it pays in taxes to improve services -- a message some voters found patronizing. Lehane, a veteran of Washington politics, long ago learned not to take anything for granted in an election -- especially a ballot initiative entwined with the hot-button issue of economic inequality. \u201cI feel like we have some real momentum, \u201d Lehane says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also lived through a number of elections, and I learned a long time ago that you always sleep with both eyes open in an election.\u201d For years, Airbnb has mostly gotten along with municipal officials. The company has struck deals with Paris, Chicago, San Francisco, Portland, Oregon, and others to collect taxes on behalf of the hosts using its platform. Uber\u00a0Technologies Inc. has taken a more forceful approach, most recently running attack ads against the administration of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and successfully defeating the city\u2019s efforts to slow Uber\u2019s growth. Last year, Uber hired former Obama strategist David Plouffe as a senior vice president of policy and strategy (he has since become the hailing service\u2019s chief adviser and joined the board). Now that Airbnb is under attack in its hometown, the company has recruited its own political operative. In former Clinton strategist Lehane, Airbnb has a Harvard-trained lawyer who tried to contain the Monica Lewinsky scandal and later defended Goldman Sachs during the 2008 financial crisis. In recent years, he has worked with various tech players; Lehane helped former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer buy the Los Angeles Clippers and guided hedge fund manager Tom Steyer\u2019s efforts to elect environmentally conscious politicians. Since joining Airbnb, Lehane has met with Washington lawmakers, spent a few weeks overseas\u00a0and plans to testify before the New York City Council on Friday. Right now, however, he\u2019s largely focused on beating back Proposition F, which observers say has a decent chance of passing in this political environment. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Lehane says, \u201cthe opposition has effectively tried to frame this as an up or down vote on Airbnb.\u201d The company\u2019s anti-Prop F effort has been designed to appear arms-length. The \u201cSF for Everyone Campaign\u201d is technically run independently of Airbnb\u00a0and the company\u2019s name is hard to find on \u201cNo on Prop F\u201d mailers. Yet Airbnb is the main financial backer and its employees -- including Lehane -- are regularly consulted on strategy. On any given weekday paid workers go door-to-door, urging likely voters to sign cards pledging support. The campaign has knocked on more than 150,000 doors, spoken with 62,000 voters and won endorsements from\u00a0the San Francisco Chronicle and the city\u2019s largest Chinese-language publication. The campaign has shrewdly made Airbnb hosts, not the company, the face of its defense. Karen Cancino, who rented a room in her Western Addition neighborhood home through Airbnb 266 times last year, has appeared in campaign commercials, made phone calls, attended hearings and plans to help monitor the polls on election day. The 75-year-old former social worker says Prop F is \u201cjust too draconian, too extreme.\u201d Backers of Prop F blame Airbnb for exacerbating San Francisco\u2019s housing crisis because homes used as hotels aren\u2019t available for long-term renters. Opponents including Mayor Ed Lee say the ability to rent out apartments helps people pay their bills. The Airbnb campaign picks at perceived flaws in the proposal, arguing that propositions are hard to repeal and that this one would empower people to sue neighbors over illegal Airbnb units. Airbnb says a survey\u00a0of 500 likely voters conducted Oct. 25 to Oct. 27 showed Prof F losing by 19 percentage points. The pro-proposition forces insist they\u2019ll prevail and point to the fallout from the alienating ads -- a move even Airbnb supporters deem a major unforced error. One of the ads, which originated with the company, not the campaign, read: \u201cDear Public Library System, We hope you use some of the $12 million in hotel taxes to keep the library open later. Love, Airbnb.\u201d Condemnation was fierce, and one online critic suggested that the $8 million being lavished on the anti-Prop F campaign could be used as a block grant for the library system. The company apologized, but by then the ads had been plastered on bus stations all over the city. Airbnb says the ads will come down. The stakes are high for Airbnb, last valued at $25.5 billion and widely expected to go public in the coming years. Losing the ballot could encourage political activists in other cities to push for similar restrictions. \u201cIt\u2019s the first public referendum on Airbnb in the country, if not the world,\u201d says Doug Engmann, a former San Francisco city planning commissioner, Airbnb antagonist and an author of Proposition F. \u201cThey want to make sure they win that referendum.\u201d","timestamp":1446105600.0,"participant_ids":["9865065Z:US","0084207D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-29\/airbnb-unleashes-clinton-era-operative-to-take-on-hometown-foes","subject":"Airbnb Unleashes a Clinton-Era Operative to Take On Hometown Foes"},{"body":"Investors won\u2019t find much to celebrate if U.S. retailers continue their descent. The megalith that is Amazon.com Inc. is overshadowing broader weakness, as one-third of large-cap stocks in the industry are heading for their worst annual losses since 2008. From specialty apparel to department stores, 2015 is shaping up as an uncommonly bad year for stocks in the industry as consumers cut back on spending in October. Dollar Tree Inc., Macy\u2019s Inc. and Tiffany & Co. are among 11 stocks in the 31-member Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Retailing Industry Group Index poised to post their biggest declines since the U.S. economy was in the midst of a recession. While the\u00a0S&P retail index\u2019s 18 percent gain this year is the best among 24 groups in the broader measure, Amazon alone accounts for more than three-quarters of the advance, while Netflix Inc. and Home Depot Inc. each deliver more than 10 percent. Sure, consumers\u2019 fashion preferences can be finicky and some retailers are losing market share to the Internet. But investors are questioning how long indexes tracking retailers can remain aloft on the strength of three or four companies. \u201cThere\u2019s weakness being masked by Amazon, but there\u2019s also weakness caused by Amazon,\u201d said Carter Worth, a New York-based technical analyst at Cornerstone Macro LLC. On the eve of the industry\u2019s biggest season for sales, the prospects are \u201cuninspiring,\u201d he said. Good times are coming to an end for the broader consumer discretionary group, which has rallied 390 percent since March 2009, Worth said. The group slumped 2.9 percent in the third quarter before rebounding in October. He downgraded his recommendation on these stocks to underweight from overweight on Nov. 6. \u201cIt just all smells like it\u2019s on borrowed time now.\u201d Department stores have been especially hard hit. Macy\u2019s tumbled 14 percent Wednesday, the most since 2008, after the Cincinnati-based chain\u00a0  third-quarter sales estimates and cut its annual profit forecast. The stock has fallen 41 percent this year, its biggest decline since 2008\u2019s 60 percent selloff. Nordstrom Inc.\u00a0fell 15 percent today after   results Thursday that missed estimates. The stock is down 32 percent year-to-date, on track for its first annual slide in seven years. Kohl\u2019s Corp.\u00a0got a reprieve from its beatdown this year after   late Wednesday that profit and sales topped analysts\u2019 forecasts. Even after Thursday\u2019s 6.1 percent gain, it\u2019s still down almost 30 percent in 2015.\u00a0 \u201cEverybody\u2019s been waiting for this gas savings spending to materialize somewhere and the frustration is building that it\u2019s not,\u201d said Dave Lutz, the Annapolis, Maryland-based head of exchange-traded funds trading for JonesTrading Institutional Services.\u00a0 Macy\u2019s rout this week dragged down an index of mall real-estate investment trusts and fueled declines for the broader retail group, as only one advanced -- TripAdvisor Inc. \u201cPeople have been selling the stocks that are primarily shopping mall-based and buying ones that are primarily Internet-based,\u201d Lutz said. \u201cIt feels like everybody\u2019s been throwing out the baby with the bath water.\u201d Amazon has more than doubled this year, fueled largely by gains in its fast-growing cloud-computing division. Netflix is up 112 percent as its subscriber base continues to swell globally. Small-cap specialty retailers have slumped 19 percent to a two-year low, the group\u2019s biggest decline since it began trading in 2009. Pier 1 Imports Inc. is among seven companies in the 56-member index with declines exceeding 50 percent this year. Selling in traditional retailers picked up last month after Wal-Mart Stores Inc.   that annual profit will fall rather than rise, with earnings squeezed as the company pumps money into its workforce and e-commerce operations. \u201cThe real selling has come recently,\u201d particularly after Wal-Mart raised \u201cred flags,\u201d said Katrina Lamb, head of investment strategy and research at MV Capital Management Inc. in Bethesda, Maryland, where she helps oversee about $500 million.\u00a0\u201cWith the big season coming up, this is the time of year where everyone focuses on retail. There\u2019s a general negative sense that it\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d Sales during the holiday season will be slower than last year, according to   from the National Retail Federation and Deloitte LLP. The faltering shares among well-known retailers belie\u00a0data that show consumer spending has slowed, though not deteriorated. Retail sales rose an average of 0.2 percent in January-October, compared with 0.4 percent in the comparable period of 2014. Purchases rose 0.1 percent  , less than the 0.3 percent forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. As a result, the overly pessimistic sentiment about retailers could provide a buying opportunity for contrarians like Lutz, who said some of his counterparts have become \u201ctoo dire\u201d about these stocks. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel to me like the U.S. economy is falling apart right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you look at these stocks and it\u2019s like we\u2019re back in a recession.\u201d","timestamp":1447383601.0,"participant_ids":["AMZN:US","M:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-13\/amazon-masks-deepening-wounds-in-retail-stocks-before-holidays","subject":"Amazon Masks Deepening Wounds in Retail Stocks Before Holidays"},{"body":"Nordstrom Inc. joined Macy\u2019s Inc. in posting woeful results last quarter, renewing concern that U.S. shoppers are skipping a trip to the mall and spending their money on cars, homes and iPhones instead. Nordstrom\u2019s profit shrank to 57 cents a share in the period, excluding some items, the company said on Thursday. Analysts had projected 72 cents on average. Sales also missed estimates, even at the company\u2019s once-hot Nordstrom Rack outlet chain. The problem? Department stores aren\u2019t drawing the same foot traffic. Though the job market is improving and the U.S. economy is chugging along, Americans would rather spend their money elsewhere. Nordstrom\u2019s results sent its shares down 15 percent on Friday, the biggest decline in more than 15 years. That follows a similar swoon for Macy\u2019s after it released weak earnings earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of bizarre,\u201d said Dorothy Lakner, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets in New York. \u201cPeople have money.

Penney Inc., which beat sales estimates in the third quarter, is approaching the holiday cautiously. The retailer didn\u2019t raise its annual guidance despite posting a same-store sales gain of 6.4 percent last quarter. That exceeded the 4.5 percent increase analysts expected. J.C. Penney shares fell 15 percent to $7.44 in New York on Friday. The company, benefiting from a turnaround plan, had gained 36 percent this year through Thursday. Retailers and clothing suppliers have struggled to pare down excess inventories, forcing them to rely more on discounts.

But that may help Nordstrom in the holiday period, according to Lakner. \u201cThe good news is at Nordstrom, they cleaned their inventory,\u201d Lakner said. \u201cThey made adjustments to the fourth quarter. They\u2019re in a pretty good position.\u201d Nordstrom\u2019s same-store sales, a closely watched benchmark, grew just 0.9 percent last quarter,\u00a0which ended Oct. 31. Analysts had estimated 3.6 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. Sales fell 2.2 percent at the Rack chain, missing a projection for growth of 2.8 percent. The company now expects earnings of $3.40 to $3.50 a share this year, excluding some items. That\u2019s down from an earlier forecast of as much as $3.80. An unseasonably warm autumn also has been blamed for sluggish sales at U.S. retailers. Macy\u2019s said earlier this week that the weather hurt demand for coats, sweaters and boots.

The company signed a 12-year lease to increase its space in the tower and will move employees there from 1095 Avenue of the Americas, 277 Park Ave. and its Long Island City offices in Queens, New York-based MetLife said Wednesday in an e-mailed statement. The moves are to be completed by 2017, the insurer said. The move will bring the company full-circle, having once occupied a substantial portion of the landmark property, known as the MetLife Building, before selling it to a partnership led by Tishman Speyer in 2005. MetLife moved more than 900 workers to a converted warehouse in Long Island City in 2001, then shifted most of them back to Manhattan to 1095 Avenue of the Americas about six years later. Both 200 Park and the 1095 building have the MetLife logo at their tops. The MetLife Building \u201cis an iconic landmark in New York City,\u201d John Calagna, a spokesman for the insurer, said in the statement. \u201cAnd our MetLife sign is a world-renowned part of the skyline.\u201d The company, which already has 200 Park as its official headquarters, will have a total of 530,000 square feet in the 3 million-square-foot (279,000-square-meter) building, said a person with knowledge of the lease, who asked not to be named because the details are private. It is adding about 430,000 square feet under the new agreement, according to the MetLife statement. The New York Post reported the deal earlier Wednesday. The building, which sits astride Grand Central Terminal, gained fame in the 1960s as the Pan Am Building before Pan American World Airways Inc. went bankrupt about 30 years later. MetLife bought it in 1980, then replaced the Pan Am sign at the top with its own in 1993 after the airline\u2019s demise.

The Securities and Exchange Commission last week sued two Belize-based brokerages, as well as three firms in the Cayman Islands and Panama, saying they generated more than $75 million by dumping worthless shares of shell companies. While the case doesn\u2019t mention Cynk, the SEC said one of the defendants, Clear Water Securities Inc., was run by Phil Kueber -- one of the people tied to Cynk, which said it planned to run a social network but had no assets, no revenue and, for one hour in July, a market value of more than $6 billion. The other Belize firm, Legacy Global Markets SA,   as the fourth floor of Belize City\u2019s Matalon building, which Cynk also called home. Cynk is among thousands of companies that trade in over-the-counter markets for a few pennies a share, where disclosure rules are looser and con artists have been known to lurk. The stock began its surge in mid-June, grabbing the attention of traders, Wall Street bloggers and newspapers, who questioned how the company\u2019s value could suddenly soar into the billions, even on paper. The shares collapsed after the SEC   for 10 days. This week, they traded for 3 cents. Regulators haven\u2019t cited anyone for misconduct related to the stock. Kueber, who isn\u2019t named as a defendant in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit, declined to comment Monday. He said last year that he was a consultant to Cynk and never bought or sold its shares. The company, originally known as Introbuzz when his brother founded it in 2008, took on its current identity in 2013. A \u201cPhil Keeber\u201d was listed on a form that year releasing the Cynk Technology name for the company\u2019s use. Shortly after Cynk relocated to Belize, Kueber bought a condo on the nearby island of San Pedro, Bloomberg News reported last year. The SEC\u2019s suit, filed in Manhattan federal court, focuses in part on Swingplane Ventures Inc., a company that said it planned to get into golf apparel, though it hadn\u2019t sold any yet. Swingplane\u2019s stock chart looks like Cynk\u2019s, with the shares dormant for months before a sudden and short-lived jump. According to the regulators, Swingplane conducted a \u201csham\u201d stock offering in order to make shares available for sale to U.S. investors. Kueber then arranged to have more than 120 million shares transferred to Clear Water, Legacy and Caledonian Bank Ltd. in September 2012, the SEC said. Clear Water got the most, about 35 percent, the agency said. Four months later, Swingplane issued press releases saying it was a mining company exploring the \u201cAlgarrobo Property\u201d in Chile. AwesomePennyStocks, a now-defunct e-mail list that once touted stocks, also featured Swingplane shares. \u201cSWVI is our monster pick of the month,\u201d AwesomePennyStocks said in a message cited by the SEC. Swingplane jumped to as much as 90 cents a share, valuing it at more than $200 million on paper. Clear Water, Legacy and Caledonian sold their stakes, generating $31.7 million, according to the SEC, which didn\u2019t identify any of the brokers\u2019 clients. Caledonian said in a statement Monday that it\u2019s cooperating with the SEC and \u201cworking to prove that its actions were appropriate.\u201d There was no response to messages left at Swingplane. Attempts to get comments from the other two brokerages were unsuccessful. The SEC said in a separate lawsuit last year that AwesomePennyStocks was run by John Babikian, a  . He settled that case in July, agreeing to forfeit $3.7 million without admitting or denying wrongdoing. Stanley Morris, Babikian\u2019s lawyer, declined to comment Monday. The case filed last week is at least the second that\u2019s been brought against defendants with connections to Cynk since the stock\u2019s collapse. U.S. prosecutors said last year that the fourth floor of the Matalon also was at the center of a   money-laundering and penny-stock manipulation scheme. Legacy and other defendants were accused in that case of conspiring to let Americans who wanted to manipulate stocks set up companies that hid their involvement. Others charged in the case held Cynk stock for clients and set up companies that conceal its ownership, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News.

All-Stars Investment Ltd. led the latest round of financing, the startup said in a statement on Monday. The Chinese investment firm also backs smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. Tujia, which means \u201chome on a journey,\u201d is focusing on expanding its services into Asian destinations popular with Chinese travelers, Melissa Yang, the co-founder and chief technology officer, said in an interview. Tujia expects to list 400,000 to 500,000 properties for rent by year\u2019s end, from more than 300,000 now, she said. \u201cWe are speeding up our expansion to meet the demands of Chinese tourists,\u201d Yang said Monday by phone. \u201cSoutheast Asia is a destination favored by Chinese tourists and so that\u2019s an area of focus for us.\u201d Its main target markets include Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, though the startup already connects homeowners with vacationers as far afield as Paris and Los Angeles. While the startup is expanding, the Chinese economy is projected to grow at its slowest pace in a quarter-century. Yang said any slowdown would actually help the business by encouraging homeowners to list their properties in order to earn additional income. Travelers would also tend to seek cheaper alternatives to hotels, she said. Tujia, which is backed by investors including HomeAway Inc., Ctrip.com International Ltd., LightSpeed Venture Partners and GGV Capital, has undergone three previous rounds of financing. The startup often draws comparisons with Airbnb, the service that helped foster what\u2019s now referred to as \u201cthe sharing economy.\u201d Tujia will be adding a new service that links users directly with homeowners, Yang said, drawing it still closer to its U.S. counterpart. In the past, the majority of the Chinese company\u2019s listings had been managed either by itself or third-party companies, instead of homeowners. Tujia and its peers now face regulatory uncertainty around the world, as local interests consider the effect of on-demand services on traditional industries from taxis to hotels. Unlike Airbnb, which in the U.S. has drawn the attention of New York enforcement agencies for not paying hotel occupancy taxes, Tujia has so far remained relatively free of regulatory tangles. It collects the money and pays hotel levies as well as taxes on the rental income on behalf of property owners. It also differs from its American counterpart in that it offers a range of ancillary services, from property management and inspections of listings to cleanups after guests leave. Yang said the senior Chinese leadership has expressed support for new online businesses, including online vacation rentals.

In two weeks, Lowe\u2019s will open a store on the corner of Broadway and 68th Street that\u2019s just 30,000 square feet (2,800 square meters). The location is a quarter the size of its suburban home-improvement centers and represents the company\u2019s first foray into Manhattan in its 69-year history. But it\u2019s more notable as a testing ground for what could be Lowe\u2019s next sales engine -- cities. \u201cWe strongly believe that we have a growth model here,\u201d Richard Maltsbarger, chief development officer for Lowe\u2019s, said on Thursday during a tour of the store. Lowe\u2019s is facing the same dilemma as many big-box peers: finding growth in a mature retail landscape. Back when the American suburbs were booming and filling up with shopping centers, opening gigantic stores on cheap land fueled the industry. The latest recession and the rise of online shopping brought an end to that approach. Established chains are either  . Lowe\u2019s only added two U.S. locations last year, and the store count at larger rival Home Depot Inc. was flat. That\u2019s why developing a small enough format to work in a dense city is crucial. Chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and   have already started down this path. And for good reason. Unlike many suburbs, cities are on the upswing again with consumers streaming back. They also contain some of the richest communities in the country. \u201cWhere is the next avenue for growth? It\u2019s urban,\u201d said Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. who tracks the retail industry. But shrinking a big-box store is difficult. Take Home Depot, which opened smaller locations in the last decade and since closed them. The chain does have two locations in Manhattan, but they are more than three times the size of the new Lowe\u2019s. With a small urban store, there are logistical problems, like receiving shipments on city streets. It also can be challenging to customize the assortment. Higher rents and labor costs, meanwhile, make it harder to be profitable. That\u2019s why Lowe\u2019s spent 18 months studying how Manhattanites live and their contractors and plumbers work. That research led to the new location\u2019s design: a mashup of a neighborhood hardware store and a remodeling studio crafted for connected urbanites. It\u2019s filled with trendy products -- like Smeg retro-style refrigerators -- and plenty of technology. Take the entrance, where a large touch screen shows home-improvement clips from the Vine video-sharing network. If shoppers want to see that day\u2019s deals, a number is displayed for them to text. Customers then walk through eight small departments. Near the front is organization and storage, with moving boxes and ceiling bike racks -- city essentials. The seasonal area is dedicated to spicing up balconies. There\u2019s a kitchen set that could fit into a tiny studio apartment, complete with an 18-inch dishwasher. And because people may be on their lunch break or in a rush after work, half a dozen employees will stand by with mobile checkout devices, providing a faster alternative to cash registers. \u201cWe started fresh,\u201d said Jonathan Luster, vice president of market and concept development at Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe\u2019s. \u201cWe talked about what do we need to put in here, not what do we need to take out to shrink the box.\u201d Lowe\u2019s, founded in 1946, is by no means desperate for this to take off. The company has increased sales more than 5 percent each of the past two years, and total revenue topped $56 billion last year thanks to a rebound in housing values. With more equity in their homes, Americans are spending money to  . Lowe\u2019s stock is up about 40 percent in the past year, more than four times the gain of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. But it needs to find more ways to grow. Like Home Depot, it\u2019s investing heavily in the melding of online and physical stores -- a combination the industry has dubbed \u201comnichannel.\u201d These improvements are why Lowe\u2019s decided now was the right time to go small in cities. It spent five years revamping its inventory and supply chain systems to make fulfilling purchases more flexible. It now needs less space for inventory because the chain can deliver products within a day by shipping them from nearby stores. This New York store -- along with a second Manhattan location planned for later this year in the Chelsea neighborhood -- will try to be at the vanguard of this effort. In the design center, customers can use a television-sized screen to browse online offerings and make purchases for delivery. In the lamps section, there are two dozen in stock and another 1,000 on the Lowe\u2019s website. In appliances, an eight-foot touch screen offers interactive life-sized renderings of refrigerators not carried in the store. Lowe\u2019s got started on small formats in 2013 when it   of Orchard Supply Hardware Stores Corp., including about 70 stores, after that chain filed for bankruptcy. These locations are about 35,000 square feet and in major cities like Los Angeles. One of the many ways Orchard shaped the Manhattan store is figuring out how to accept shipments in a smaller space. Instead of receiving goods on pallets that are unloaded by forklifts, products are packaged on wheeled carts that are rolled into the store. That cuts down on truck delivery times, thereby reducing traffic and noise. For Maltsbarger, this store is a long time coming. The first research study he did when he started at Lowe\u2019s 11 years ago involved city shoppers. And he\u2019s already thinking about what\u2019s next. \u201cOf course, we want to get it open, see how people respond to it, but we\u2019re already looking ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cTo other cities, other markets\u201d","timestamp":1438338776.0,"participant_ids":["LOW:US","HD:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-31\/lowe-s-squeezes-into-tight-manhattan-space-as-big-box-era-fades","subject":"Lowe\u2019s Squeezes Into Manhattan Space as Big-Box Era Fades"},{"body":" Lowe\u2019s Cos. posted first-quarter profit that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates as it failed to fend off a promotional blitz from rival Home Depot Inc. during the retailers\u2019 most important season. Profit in the three months through May 1 was 70 cents a share, Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe\u2019s said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts estimated 74 cents. Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot both barraged consumers with deals last quarter, which generates more sales for them than the winter holiday season. Home Depot expanded its \u201cSpring Black Friday\u201d event with discounts on the Web to accompany in-store deals. Lowe\u2019s held a similar event and dedicated more prominent floor space to seasonal goods like patio furniture. In the end, Home Depot came out on top, stunning analysts who had estimated that Lowe\u2019s same-store sales growth would top Home Depot\u2019s for the first time since 2006. \u201cWe are surprised,\u201d David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, said in a research note. \u201cThe stores looked so good and were ready for spring, inventory was plush, and merchandising seemed spot on.\u201d Same-store sales at Lowe\u2019s rose 5.2 percent in the quarter, trailing Home Depot\u2019s 6.1 percent increase. Analysts had projected Lowe\u2019s would post a 6.1 percent gain and that Home Depot would boost sales 5.5 percent. Revenue growth trailed internal projections because Lowe\u2019s pushed some promotions into the second quarter after warmer temperatures in parts of the country arrived later than expected, Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said. Still, the company is \u201cvery optimistic\u201d about the U.S. housing market, and sales have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d so far this month, Niblock said. The trend gave it confidence to maintain its annual sales and profit forecast, he said. Lowe\u2019s fell 4.6 percent to $68.50 in New York trading, the biggest drop since November 2013. The stock is now down 0.4 percent this year, compared with a 6.8 percent increase for Home Depot. Strasser said Lowe\u2019s may be hampered in the U.S. by having stores in worse locations than Home Depot. \u201cOtherwise we struggle to determine why they would underperform Home Depot, especially as they operate better and better on a regular basis,\u201d Strasser said. Lowe\u2019s domestic same-store sales fared especially badly against its larger rival. Home Depot\u2019s U.S. same-store sales climbed 7.1 percent, beating the 5.3 percent gain at Lowe\u2019s. Even though Lowe\u2019s missed estimates, the company is boosting sales faster than most of the retail industry. Customers are   to their homes as they   and away from apparel and other consumer goods. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.   that total U.S. same-store sales rose 1 percent, missing estimates. Lowe\u2019s net income rose 7.9 percent to $673 million, or 70 cents a share, from $624 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Total revenue increased 5.4 percent to $14.1 billion, trailing analysts\u2019 $14.3 billion estimate. The company repeated its forecast that profit this year would be about $3.29 per share. Analysts estimated $3.31. Chief Financial Officer Bob Hull said on a conference call that sales so far in May have exceeded its expectations. Home Depot\u2019s first-quarter total sales and profit both beat analysts\u2019 , and the retailer boosted its annual forecast on both fronts. Data released by the Commerce Department Tuesday underscored the homebuilding industry\u2019s health, which is helping both retailers. U.S. housing starts   20 percent in April to the highest level in more than seven years. While those figures were encouraging, Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot care more about residential real estate prices. The National Association of Realtors expects about 5.83 million new and existing homes to be sold this year, but there are about 74 million American homeowners who may spend more on their dwellings if they think they\u2019re rising in value. The data on the pricing front has been strong as well. The median price of a single-family home rose 7.4 percent in the first three months of the year, according to the Realtors group. Prices climbed in 85 percent of U.S. metropolitan areas, the group said.","timestamp":1432105551.0,"participant_ids":["LOW:US","HD:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-20\/lowe-s-first-quarter-profit-trails-estimates-as-promotions-fail","subject":"Lowe\u2019s Misses Estimates After Home Depot Wins Spring Battle"},{"body":" \u201cWall Street is an echo chamber,\u201d Deutsche Bank chief U.S. equity strategist David Bianco told clients, \u201cand sometimes it can give you a headache.\u201d No argument here (here... here... here...).

Just be sure to pop an Advil first. Wells Fargo: \u201cThe strong dollar has dominated headlines through the first few weeks of earnings season, and speculation about the durability of U.S. economic and earnings growth in the face of presumed dollar strength is running rampant.\u201d Goldman Sachs: \u201cThe impact of currency is all investors want to talk about.\u201d Deutsche Bank citing a request: \u201cPlease send a list of S&P 500 firms with no FX exposure, no Banks or Energy.\u201d Sorting out the impact to U.S. corporate earnings from the stronger dollar can be tough, especially with other tectonic shifts like the price of oil in the mix. Goldman Sachs made the case that top-line revenue is more at risk than earnings, since hedges and expenses paid overseas in other currencies limit damage to the bottom line. This may help explain why halfway through the reporting season, revenue is down 0.4 percent for S&P 500 companies while earnings are up 3.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Comments from corporate management imply the stronger dollar will cut future sales growth by 3 to 5 percentage points at S&P 500 companies, which get about a third of sales overseas, Goldman strategists wrote in a Jan. 30 note. That\u2019s not to say there will be no damage to profits. Earnings guidance for the first quarter is coming in below Wall Street\u2019s estimates at an \u201castounding\u201d rate of 87 percent of companies, which Goldman Sachs said is the highest level in 34 quarters worth of data. Analysts are busy dissecting the S&P 500 into companies more or less affected by dollar strength due to how much revenue they book overseas. And despite that client request to keep banks off the list, Bianco points out that financial companies are the dominant domestic cyclical stocks. They are most sensitive to U.S. gross domestic product and relatively insulated from foreign economies, he wrote, with banks in the unusual position of standing to benefit from potential interest rate increases. Outside of financials, the most domestically sensitive stocks include retailers, homebuilders, airlines and trucking firms, according to Bianco. His list of picks include a mix of cyclical and defensive stocks: Lowe\u2019s Cos., Macy\u2019s Inc., Dollar General Corp., Ross Stores Inc., Nordstrom Inc., Tractor Supply Co., Southwest Airlines Co., Exelon Corp., Edison International, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., CMS Energy Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. Of course, the market has already picked potential winners and losers. Wells Fargo strategist Gina Martin Adams\u2019s math shows that share prices have fallen faster than earnings estimates for companies most dependent on foreign sales. Meanwhile, she wrote, share prices have risen at companies more reliant on domestic revenue even though they also saw cuts in earnings estimates, resulting in a widening valuation premium for domestically focused companies. Yet, Martin Adams argued, changes in international economic growth have had an even larger impact on revenue than the dollar. As a result, she wrote, \u201cthe outlook may not be as dire as the headlines may lead you to believe.\u201d The bar has been set too low for Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development economies outside the U.S., she said, and surprisingly strong growth for those nations may overwhelm the effects of dollar strength and allow S&P 500 earnings to beat estimates.

The center is brimming with discounted fare from J. Crew Group Inc., Coach Inc. and other brands, much like the dozens of outlet malls that have sprung up in distant suburbs across the country over the past 40 years. Here\u2019s the difference: It\u2019s just a short 16-mile jaunt from the city and located right by the bustling O\u2019Hare International Airport. After years of outperforming regular malls, outlets are increasingly encroaching on downtown shopping districts. The shift is part of a painful dislocation for brick-and-mortar retailers, which are abandoning decades of etiquette as they chase a dwindling number of shoppers. \u201cWe\u2019re becoming more outlet-focused for sure in the United States,\u201d said Laurent Vasilescu, an analyst at Macquarie Capital in New York. Department stores and other full-price retailers -- once the preferred place for clothing brands to showcase their wares -- don\u2019t offer the same kind of growth as outlets. Brands and retailers used to have an understanding about outlets. Neither one wanted the discount malls too close to full-price stores because they might hurt total sales. If shoppers can just drive a short distance and get a cheaper handbag from the same brand, why buy a full-price one from a local department store? As a result, brands like Nike Inc. and Gap Inc.\u2019s Banana Republic typically put their outlets and factory stores far from town. Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, a popular center in Central Valley, New York, is at least an hour\u2019s drive from midtown Manhattan. In the San Francisco Bay area, the premium outlets are in the distant burbs of Petaluma and Gilroy. \u201cThey really wanted to keep away and not cannibalize their own business,\u201d said Chen Grazutis, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Over the years, the outlet industry has evolved. As shoppers flocked to the stores in search of deals, companies began producing cheaper clothing exclusively for outlets. That let them maintain their profit margins and distinguish their full-price fare from their discounted products. Foot traffic at regular shopping centers, meanwhile, has been shrinking -- a trend that continued during the latest holiday season. Store visits declined 3 percent in December from a year earlier, according to ShopperTrak. The rise of Amazon.com Inc. and other e-commerce sellers have given shoppers less reason to go to malls or shopping districts. The slump has put pressure on brands to rely more on one area of brick-and-mortar retail that\u2019s largely still growing: outlets. Teen-apparel companies have been especially aggressive, even as they close regular stores. American Eagle Outfitters Inc., Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and Express Inc. are all adding outlet stores. As they pursue discount shoppers, the brands risk hurting sales of full-price merchandise, said DJ Busch, a mall analyst for Green Street Advisors. \u201cYou had to separate it from your full line because there\u2019s a different value proposition being offered there,\u201d Busch said. \u201cIf they blur that line too much, it goes from an incremental part of the business to more of a cannibalization of your full line.\u201d In the Boston area, an outlet center called   opened last year just 8 miles from downtown. New Orleans, meanwhile, has a new outlet mall called Riverwalk that\u2019s within city limits. The balance of power between traditional retailers and brands showed signs of tilting in 2002, when Nike had a rift with Foot Locker Inc. In December of that year, the sneaker maker said it would sell fewer of its shoes through Foot Locker, which was its biggest customer. At the time, more than 40 percent of the chain\u2019s revenue came from Nike. Foot Locker\u2019s stock dove 12 percent on the news. \u201cIt was clear that Nike was more important to Foot Locker,\u201d said Michael Binetti, an analyst for UBS AG in New York. \u201cNike stock got hurt a little bit. Foot Locker stock got hurt a lot.\u201d In Nike\u2019s case, the issue wasn\u2019t outlets. The company was concerned that Foot Locker wasn\u2019t promoting its higher-end sneakers enough. But the standoff showed that brands had an increasing array of options for marketing their wares. Nike relies both on its own full-price stores and outlet locations to reach customers. When a consumer goes to the brand directly -- whether it\u2019s a Nike store or a Gap Outlet location -- the brand gets more of the profit, Grazutis said. The shift has added to the headaches of department stores, which are struggling to get enough customers in the door. Macy\u2019s Inc., the largest department-store company, posted same-store sales growth of just 2 percent last quarter -- missing estimates. Some chains are taking a can\u2019t-beat-\u2019em-join-\u2019em approach. Bloomingdale\u2019s, the high-end line of department stores owned by Macy\u2019s, is opening its own outlet center this fall on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. While the company already has several outlet locations, this is the first in an urban center - - and it\u2019s just across Central Park from its flagship store. Even with the upheaval, department stores serve a purpose for brands and the old relationships still matter, said Rick Snyder, an analyst at Maxim Group in New York. They save apparel companies from having to pump money and effort into their own stores, something many can\u2019t afford to do. \u201cIt would be very difficult for, say, a Ralph Lauren to duplicate the distribution that 850 Macy\u2019s stores gives them,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1426471260.0,"participant_ids":["FL:US","NKE:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-16\/outlet-malls-move-closer-to-cities-in-upending-of-rules","subject":"Outlet Malls Move Closer to Cities in Upending of Rules"},{"body":"Athletic-shoe retailers Foot Locker Inc. and Finish Line Inc. climbed in New York trading after a Bank of America Corp. analyst raised his recommendations on the companies, citing strong footwear demand.

Inc. is on fire. Shares of the sneaker maker have doubled in just six months, giving it an almost $6 billion market value. Its revenue gains -- led by women\u2019s sporty, slip-on shoes -- have been beating every competitor. The company is now headed for record profit in the third quarter. \u201cI sure like the way the stock\u2019s gone up,\u201d said Gary Bradshaw, a Dallas-based fund manager for Hodges Capital Management Inc., which owns Skechers shares among the $3 billion it oversees. \u201cThey\u2019ve kind of caught this fashion trend just right.\u201d Just last month, Skechers surpassed sportswear giant Nike Inc.\u2019s valuation relative to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Before Skechers gets any more expensive, it might make sense for a competitor such as Nike to make an offer. The $91 billion industry leader still dwarfs Skechers in size and has almost enough cash on its balance sheet to cover a takeover. Adidas AG, the $17 billion German athletic footwear maker that owns Reebok, is under pressure to take back market share from Nike. Skechers would give either company a way to get in on the growing market for fashionable walking shoes and reach different customers at a lower price point. Skechers \u201cis well run and could be on someone\u2019s radar,\u201d said Barry James, chief executive officer at James Investment Research in Xenia, Ohio. The biggest question is whether Skechers\u2019 founder Robert Greenberg, who was 75 as of April, would be open to selling his company. Greenberg, who also developed the L.A. Gear brand, is chairman and chief executive officer of Skechers. His son Michael, 52, is president, and his other son Jeffrey, 47, is in charge of active electronic media. They all serve on the board and, with the family estate trustee, control more than 70 percent of the voting power. \u201cIt might be a little early to think that they would necessarily be wanting to sell the company,\u201d said Jeffrey Van Sinderen, an analyst at B. Riley & Co. \u201cBut it could be attractive to private equity or a strategic buyer. They have a brand and have established it even more so over the past several years. They have a nice niche.\u201d Jennifer Clay, a spokeswoman for Skechers, declined to comment on whether the company has received takeover interest or has considered a sale. Representatives for Nike and Adidas didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. While the stock has been rising since 2012, its biggest gains have come this year. The share price has already doubled in 2015, adding to last year\u2019s 67 percent surge. Analysts forecast an additional 10 percent upside to the current stock price over the next 12 months. That means it may continue to outperform Nike and Adidas, as well as Under Armour Inc., Steven Madden Ltd. and Foot Locker Inc., according to share-price estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Apparel companies rarely do mergers. One of the few cases was last month, when Ascena Retail Group Inc. agreed to acquire Ann Inc., bringing together the Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor brands. Nike also hasn\u2019t traditionally done deals this large and doesn\u2019t need Skechers. Its biggest purchase, the 2007 deal for Umbro Plc, was only $619 million. It later sold the English maker of soccer cleats. But Nike\u2019s motivation behind its 2003 purchase of Converse Inc. may be most similar to what its rationale could be for buying Skechers: the desire to capture a growing market. At the time of the $332 million Converse acquisition, Nike\u2019s U.S. shoe sales were declining. Converse was a way for it to grab hold of classic footwear such as Chuck Taylors, which were gaining in popularity. Skechers recently introduced a line of running shoes that are catching on. Olympic runner Meb Keflezighi wore them when he won the 2014 Boston Marathon and finished eighth in 2015. Like its other products, Skechers running shoes are cheaper than most other brands. It\u2019s also added memory foam to certain comfort shoes, helping it target older customers that competitors such as Nike don\u2019t typically focus on. While Nike\u2019s sales are still expanding, the company has gotten so large that the pace of gains could start to slow. Analysts project an average annual growth rate of about 7 percent for the next five years, down from an average of 10 percent during the last decade. Estimates for Skechers only go out as far as 2017. During that time, its sales may climb an average of 18 percent per year. With borrowing costs still so low, a deal would be accretive. An all-cash offer even at a 35 percent premium -- about $151 a share -- would immediately boost Nike\u2019s earnings per share, data compiled by Bloomberg show. And that\u2019s without estimating any cost cuts it could make. Now, let\u2019s see if these sneakers are made for dealmaking.","timestamp":1435169329.0,"participant_ids":["SKX:US","NKE:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-24\/skechers-so-hot-that-it-may-be-worth-a-look-for-nike-real-m-a","subject":"Skechers So Hot That It May Be Worth a Look for Nike: Real M&A"},{"body":"Google Inc. hired John Krafcik, an auto-industry executive, to head up its driverless car effort as the search-engine giant pushes for broader adoption\u00a0of the new technology.

U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Elliot F. Kaye said Wednesday on a conference call that his agency is actively investigating the company and testing products dating back to 2012. The probe\u2019s results probably will be released in the coming months, Kaye said. The retailer said in an e-mailed statement that it\u2019s cooperating with the agency. Lumber Liquidators   after CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d reported on March 1 that the company sold laminate flooring that was produced in China with elevated amounts of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. The Toano, Virginia-based retailer\u2019s market value has plummeted by more than half since it disclosed that a story by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was in the works. Despite the announcement of the investigation, investors boosted the stock, partly on the revelation that the CPSC won\u2019t use the same test that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d employed. Lumber Liquidators has repeatedly cast doubt on the news program\u2019s methods and defended the safety of its products. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a win for them,\u201d David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in New York, said in an interview. \u201cThis backs up what Lumber Liquidators has been saying all along.\u201d Strasser raised his recommendation on the company to a buy on March 3, saying fears were \u201coverblown.\u201d The shares rose 11 percent Wednesday to $31.86. They gave back some of those gains Thursday, falling 6.2 percent to $29.89 at the close in New York. The company has said its products are safe and that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d used improper tests that employ what\u2019s known in the industry as a \u201cdeconstructive\u201d method to determine formaldehyde levels. The CPSC won\u2019t use that method because it doesn\u2019t replicate how floors are used in the home, Kaye said, echoing Lumber Liquidators\u2019 argument. The agency would push for a recall if it finds the flooring products are hazardous, he said. The news program says in a   on its website that it also used a second method to measure formaldehyde emissions from the flooring into the air of a typical home. The sample with the highest reading would be cited as polluted indoor conditions by the Environmental Protection Agency, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d says. The investigation, which includes other agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, is initially focusing only on flooring sold by Lumber Liquidators. \u201cWe are committed to move as fast as possible to get answers for consumers, especially the parents of young children,\u201d Kaye said. Lumber Liquidators also has tried to cast doubt by pointing out that short sellers fueled the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story. Investor Whitney Tilson went public with his shorting of the stock in 2013. He then pitched a story to \u201c60 Minutes\u201d early last year and appeared in the report. The show also featured a lawyer and the head of an environmental group who sued Lumber Liquidators after learning of a possible formaldehyde issue from the  . The retailer said earlier this month that sales   after the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report and that it would be unable to forecast revenue or profit this year because of the uncertainty it created.

KKR this week swapped its remaining stake in Alliance Boots for $4.7 billion in cash and Walgreen shares when Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen completed the deal, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private. That boosted KKR\u2019s return on paper to about $7 billion, or almost three times the amount the buyout firm invested in the 2007 deal. KKR, led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, put $2.45 billion into the $22 billion buyout of Alliance Boots, which was financed with cash and debt. Struck at the height of a debt-fueled buyout wave before the financial crisis, the deal was the largest European buyout on record. KKR\u2019s profit is a bright spot for the firm, which has posted mixed results on its boom-era deals. Most of the $3 billion investment KKR and its clients sank in a $48 billion buyout of Texas power producer TXU Corp. in 2007 stands to be wiped out in bankruptcy. Another 2007 takeover, of retailer Dollar General Corp., yielded a $10.4 billion gain, making it KKR\u2019s most lucrative deal ever. Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for KKR, declined to comment. KKR still owns 49.4 million Walgreen shares, valued at $3.75 billion, meaning its return on the deal can still rise or shrink with the share price. Walgreen took a 45 percent stake in Alliance Boots in 2012 in an effort to build a global pharmacy chain, paying $4 billion in cash and giving Alliance Boots shareholders 83.4 million of its own shares. KKR pocketed $1.8 billion and took 6.4 million Walgreen shares, keeping about a 25 percent interest in Alliance Boots, according to the person. The 2012 deal gave Walgreen an option to gain full control of the chain within three years, which Walgreen agreed in August to exercise. According to a Dec. 31 statement, it paid $16.3 billion in cash and stock for the rest of Alliance Boots.

Family Dollar declined 1.7 percent to $76.69 after Dollar Tree threatened to walk away if investors didn\u2019t accept its current offer, which values the company at about $76.85 a share. Family Dollar\u2019s management, meanwhile, reiterated its concerns about a $80-a-share bid by Dollar General Corp. While that proposal carries a richer price, it faces long odds in an antitrust review and the combined company could be forced to divest more than 5,000 stores, Family Dollar said. \u201cThe probability of the Dollar General deal occurring has now gone down, while the probability of the Dollar Tree deal has gone up,\u201d said Louis Meyer, a special-situations analyst at Oscar Gruss & Son Inc. in New York. After Dollar Tree made the bid in July, some investors had been betting that the company would raise its price, or that Dollar General would win out with its bid of $80 a share, Meyer said. That\u2019s less likely now. Dollar Tree also is applying more pressure on Family Dollar investors to accept its deal. After two delays, the Chesapeake, Virginia-based company is threatening to walk away from the offer if investors don\u2019t vote on the bid at a meeting on Jan. 22. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is reviewing both transactions to determine whether they would undercut industry competition. Dollar General is the market leader and more closely competes with Family Dollar, meaning its proposal would face more scrutiny. So far, Dollar General has only agreed to divest 1,500 locations as part of its acquisition proposal. That\u2019s not nearly enough, according to Matthews, North Carolina-based Family Dollar. The question now is how Dollar General responds, Meyer said. The company could raise its price again or offer to divest more stores.

The main obstacle is a rival offer by Dollar General Corp. for $80 a share -- a bid that Family Dollar has spurned, saying the transaction would be blocked by regulators. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is reviewing both deals to determine whether they would undercut industry competition. Dollar General is the market leader and more closely competes with Family Dollar, meaning it\u2019s proposal would face more scrutiny. The agency has identified 5,850 stores in a potential Dollar General deal that are \u201cproblematic,\u201d Family Dollar said today. That suggests they may have to be sold off to preserve competition. A Dollar Tree transaction, meanwhile, would involve just 310 such stores, Family Dollar said. Dollar General has offered to divest as many as 1,500 stores, which Family Dollar contends isn\u2019t nearly enough. That has led Family Dollar\u2019s management to choose the less risky option and back the Dollar Tree purchase, even at a lower price. The question is whether Family Dollar shareholders agree. Another delay of the vote might lead Dollar Tree to terminate the deal and become eligible to collect a $305 million breakup fee. Dollar Tree said in its own statement today that it expects agreement with FTC by the end of this month on the number of stores it will need to divest. The chain said it believes the number of locations will be fewer than 300. The retailer also said it has identified potential buyers for those stores.

After being spurned twice by Family Dollar, Dollar General took its offer   in September. The company said today that it would provide an update on its dealings with the FTC before the Jan. 22 vote.

The vote was announced at an investor meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday morning. Family Dollar\u2019s management had argued that Dollar Tree\u2019s $77.05-a-share offer was more likely to win regulators\u2019 approval than Dollar General\u2019s $80-a-share bid.

Dollar Tree said its own bid would require selling fewer than 300 locations. Speculation that Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree would prevail increased last week when Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an influential proxy adviser for large investors, recommended accepting the offer because of its \u201cnear certainty\u201d of closing. ISS also said that Dollar General\u2019s \u201cnear-silence\u201d on the regulatory process raised concerns. Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based Dollar General said it needed more time to get the FTC to approve its deal. The Dollar Tree deal has \u201cgrown more certain,\u201d while the FTC\u2019s approach to reviewing the deal \u201cappears unfavorable\u201d to Dollar General, Taylor LaBarr, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp. in Washington, wrote in a note last week. Under the terms of the Dollar Tree deal, Family Dollar locations will keep their name. Its headquarters will stay in the same place, and workers there shouldn\u2019t be worried about their jobs, Levine said in a press conference after the vote. The combination may not result in as many job cuts as the alternative because the chains have different business models and merchandise assortments. Family Dollar sells products at multiple prices and caters mostly to low-income shoppers. Dollar Tree, in contrast, attracts more middle-class consumers and sells most items for $1. While Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser will lead the new combined company, Levine will stay on and run the Family Dollar chain. That arrangement drew criticism last year, with Dollar General CEO Rick Dreiling   in a letter that part of Levine\u2019s support for the lower offer from Dollar Tree stemmed from his desire to keep his job. Levine said today that it\u2019s \u201ccompletely false\u201d that he pushed for the Dollar Tree deal to preserve his position. He also pointed out that, as Family Dollar\u2019s largest shareholder, he would have made more money with the higher offer from Dollar General. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about me or my family,\u201d said Levine, who owns about 7.7 percent of Family Dollar. \u201cIt was about our shareholders.\u201d Before announcing the vote, Levine reiterated the company\u2019s stance that the Dollar Tree proposal would have a much easier time getting approved by the FTC than Dollar General\u2019s offer. \u201cThis, by far, is a superior deal,\u201d Levine said. Dollar Tree is buying a chain that saw its business deteriorate further during the takeover battle, which began with Dollar Tree\u2019s offer in July.   47 percent in the quarter ended Nov. 29, and same-store sales declined in four of the past five quarters. The chain, which operates about 8,000 stores and generated $10.5 billion in sales in the past 12 months, has struggled with a shift in strategy from periodic promotions to everyday low prices.","timestamp":1421930103.0,"participant_ids":["DLTR:US","DG:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-22\/family-dollar-holders-approve-8-74-billion-sale-to-dollar-tree","subject":"Family Dollar Holders Accept $8.81 Billion Dollar Tree Bid"},{"body":" American employers probably added more than 200,000 workers to payrolls in August, offering Federal Reserve policy makers their last monthly labor-market snapshot before a September decision on interest rates.

Light-vehicle sales may rise to 16.7 million or more this year, Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday, from 16.5 million in 2014, the most since 2006. That would be a sixth year of growth, building on December\u2019s 16.9 million annualized pace, adjusted for seasonal trends. All automakers sold more cars and light trucks last month compared with a year earlier, and trucks closed out the year with 52 percent of the market, outselling cars every month. The decline in oil benefits the industry by reducing the cost of keeping cars running. It\u2019s especially good for sellers of trucks because it makes buyers less reluctant to own bigger vehicles with lower gas mileage. At General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, pickups accounted for about 30 percent of U.S. vehicle sales in December, which is a level not seen in almost a decade, said John Krafcik, president of Santa Monica, California-based vehicle pricing website TrueCar Inc. \u201cThat\u2019s huge,\u201d he said. \u201cGasoline prices have played a big role. Can the Big Three maintain this level of pickup sales?\u201d Krafcik said it\u2019s possible. The gain is supported by the GM\u2019s all-new Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon medium-sized pickups, which just went on sale last fall. The big sales don\u2019t fully reflect Ford\u2019s revamped aluminum-bodied F-150, which went on sale in November. When Ford is up to full production, it should be selling even more trucks, Krafcik said. Even with reduced output, Ford\u2019s F-Series was the top-selling truck line for a 38th straight year and best-selling vehicle of any kind for a 33rd straight year. The biggest risk facing the industry is an incentive battle between carmakers who are investing in new vehicles and more factories to turn them out. Automakers are \u201con a path to supply as many as 20 million vehicles\u201d during the current economic cycle, Morgan Stanley said in a research note. That would far exceed the annual record of 17.4 million U.S. light-vehicle sales, set in 2000, which could spur competing come-ons by car companies. Not only are automakers adding production, but a strong dollar will make it easier for automakers to add content without raising prices. Japanese automakers, riding a weak yen, may be especially prone to cut prices in that way, said Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice at consultant AlixPartners. A strong dollar and growing economy, also will give European and Asian carmakers an incentive to send more vehicles to the U.S. market, said Maryann Keller, an independent automotive consultant in Stamford, Connecticut. Too many models seeking buyers will lead to lower prices -- and lower profits. \u201cThis industry always overshoots,\u201d Keller said in a phone interview. \u201cThere is an enormous increase in supply coming.\u201d In the meantime, consumers are getting some help from cheap interest rates and fuel prices are helping sales for all vehicles, said Wakefield. The average price of a gallon of gasoline fell to $2.199 on Jan. 4, the lowest since May 2009, according to AAA, the motoring group. \u201cGas prices by far are the biggest deal,\u201d Wakefield said. \u201cIf you think about a year ago, with gasoline prices more than a dollar more, that\u2019s $150 billion a year of a basic stimulus for consumers.\u201d With cheap fuel and interest rates helping out, Toyota Motor Corp. sold a record number of SUVs in 2014, said Bill Fay, group vice president for Toyota\u2019s U.S. sales arm. Fay predicted 2015 will be a sixth straight year of industrywide sales growth. The company squeezed more Highlander SUVs out of its assembly plant in Princeton, Indiana. The company will also add a third shift to its Tacoma pickup plant in Tijuana, Mexico, in April, Fay said. Toyota also concluded a 13th straight year in which its Camry was the best-selling car in the U.S. Nissan is gearing up to introduce its new Titan pickup truck later this year. Fred Diaz, Nissan\u2019s senior vice president for U.S. sales, marketing and operations, said he expects strong sales, especially since the company has enjoyed a boost from its Murano and Rogue SUVs. \u201cThe truck market is going to stay strong,\u201d Diaz said in a telephone interview. \u201cOur new truck can\u2019t launch fast enough for us. Lower gas prices are always going to help you sell a lot more trucks and bigger SUVs.\u201d","timestamp":1420513275.0,"participant_ids":["GM:US","F:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-06\/gm-led-carmakers-seen-adding-to-2014-gains-as-oil-tumbles","subject":"GM-Led Carmakers Seen Adding to 2014 Gains as Oil Tumbles"},{"body":" BMW boosted December sales 11 percent to hold off Mercedes-Benz and recapture the U.S. luxury-auto sales crown for 2014, as premium brands benefited from a surging stock market, low interest rates and attractive leasing offers. BMW AG\u2019s namesake brand reported 41,526 deliveries last month, helped by the 3 and 4 Series sedans and the X5 sport-utility vehicle. Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes unit said it delivered 34,009 vehicles, a 3 percent increase, getting a push from the redesigned C-Class and GL-Class SUV. Annual sales for Munich-based BMW rose 9.8 percent to 339,738, allowing the brand to win back the title it lost to Mercedes in 2013. Mercedes, hampered early in the year by limited inventory for its popular CLA sedan, finished with 330,391, up 5.7 percent, according to its statement today. Low interest rates and high resale values have reduced leasing costs, widening the appeal of that option for car consumers generally to almost three out of 10 buyers, said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst for KBB.com. For luxury vehicles, the lease rate is almost double. New entry-level cars and SUVs, strong consumer confidence and a resurgent stock market also fueled demand for luxury vehicles, he said in an interview before the sales figures were released. \u201cThe emergence of a number of more affordable entrants in that segment, a solid financing and product environment, and demand fed by the stock market and real estate helped drive the growth,\u201d Gutierrez said. Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s Lexus brand said sales climbed 15 percent to 39,879 vehicles in December as deliveries rose 9.7 percent for the IS sedan and 3.5 percent for the RX SUV. Lexus annual sales rose 14 percent to 311,389. Lexus held the U.S. luxury-sales title for 11 years before ceding the spot to BMW in 2011. Lexus, which decided not to match the sub-$30,000 prices of Audi and Mercedes for entry-level cars, still holds hope of recapturing the sales title in the U.S., Jeff Bracken, U.S. general sales manager for Lexus,  . Mercedes made a splash in 2013, introducing its CLA with a Super Bowl ad starring Willem Dafoe as the devil and attracting new buyers to the brand. About 75 percent of CLA buyers hadn\u2019t owned a Mercedes before and were drawn by its relatively low price. Mercedes last month raised the car\u2019s base price to $31,500 from $29,900. The U.S. luxury crown is hotly contested. Steve Cannon, head of Mercedes-Benz USA, once called BMW\u2019s 2012 title a Pyrrhic victory gained by \u201csales engineering.\u201d BMW\u2019s title that year was measured by reported sales. Mercedes topped BMW in 2012 by vehicle registrations, according to researcher R.L. Polk & Co. Registration numbers aren\u2019t available until a few months after a vehicle is sold. In 2013, Mercedes   BMW for sales as well as registrations. The discrepancy between registrations and sales is because cars can be reported as sold when delivered to dealerships instead of only to consumers, Tom Libby, lead North American analyst for Southfield, Michigan-based Polk, has  . \u201cThey are all very motivated by winning the sales crown even if they will never admit it publicly,\u201d said John Krafcik, president of online automotive pricing website TrueCar Inc. \u201cThey certainly push for sales leadership toward the end of the year. They use it in their marketing.\u201d Volkswagen AG\u2019s Audi unit   December sales rose 13 percent to 19,238 vehicles, a record for any month. The brand posted 2,690 deliveries for its new entry-level A3 sedan, which starts at $29,900, and a 9.6 percent gain for the A6 sedan. Audi annual sales surged 15 percent to 182,011 vehicles, marking the fifth straight record year, the company said in the statement. About 80 percent of A3 buyers were new to premium brands, Scott Keogh, head of Audi of America, said on a sales conference call. Luring new buyers with low-price cars is a gamble, said Kevin Tynan, an auto analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Luxury brands risk alienating buyers of $100,000 flagship sedans, who will share the road with less-expensive models bearing the same badges. But BMW and Mercedes don\u2019t have a mass-market brand, as Toyota provides for Lexus, to generate a stream of aspirational buyers working their way up the brand ladder, he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been missing out on the volume buyer ready to move up to the luxury space, that first-time luxury buyer who comes in with a positive experience within that portfolio,\u201d Tynan said in an interview. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is move down market to combat that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot shorter walk to go from a Toyota store to a Lexus one than to drive over to a BMW or Mercedes dealer.\u201d , Mercedes trails BMW, which took the luxury-car sales title in 2005, and Audi, which surpassed Mercedes in 2011. Daimler Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche aims for Mercedes to overtake its rivals by 2020. Sales figures for Mercedes exclude Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler\u2019s cargo vans and Smart cars, and BMW\u2019s sales don\u2019t include the Mini brand. Cadillac, the luxury unit of General Motors Co., said December sales fell 11 percent to 16,150 vehicles, for an annual decline of 6.5 percent to 170,750. The Escalade, a large SUV that   at $72,970, was the only model to increase sales. New brand chief Johan de Nysschen is trying to rebuild the Cadillac\u2019s image. He aims to double sales globally to more than 500,000 by 2020.

Ixchel ran back and forth to her parents, who were hosting a prayer group in the dining room of their Philadelphia home, to show off the poster. The last time, she was gasping for air as she clutched a capless marker. She died of asphyxiation at the hospital with the cap stuck in her windpipe. Her parents had purchased the China-made art set for $1 at a Dollar Tree Inc. store. It didn\u2019t carry a choking-hazard warning, even though a Dollar Tree product testing specialist had suggested having one, and the cap\u2019s width of less than 1 centimeter didn\u2019t meet international safety standards. \u201cIt is a very comfortable lie that Americans are living that Uncle Sam is looking out for them to make sure products are safe,\u201d said David Kwass, an attorney who represented the Tamayo family in a lawsuit against Dollar Tree, Walt Disney Co. and others that was later settled. \u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d Almost seven years after children\u2019s deaths and injuries from collapsing cribs and defective toys led to new standards for consumer products, the rarity of inspections -- as well as loopholes in the law -- are undermining its effectiveness. As a result, both companies and the government can fail to protect families. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which regulates 10,000 products ranging from apparel to household appliances, inspects less than 1 percent of imports under its jurisdiction. With the odds stacked against being detected, cost-cutting foreign manufacturers continue to supply dangerous goods to U.S. retailers. While Dollar Tree has the most violations of any retailer cited by the safety commission, Target Corp. and Zulily Inc. also rank among the top 10 companies failing to meet standards for flammability, lead content and other criteria, commission data show. The commission is investigating Dollar Tree for consumer product safety incidents reported since 2009, according to company filings from May and last month. \u201cFor a company to be a repeat offender, and import unsafe goods over and over again, is a real problem for consumers,\u201d said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a Chicago-based nonprofit group that advocates for safer children\u2019s products. Dollar Tree spokesman Randy Guiler -- who declined to comment on the investigation, as well as the Tamayo case and its settlement -- said the company uses commission-approved laboratories to \u201censure our suppliers\u2019 products meet all safety and legal standards.\u201d Dollar Tree, based in Chesapeake, Virginia, imports only products that have passed this independent testing, and the company is deploying additional quality-control inspectors to visit manufacturing facilities daily, he said. \u201cWe work constantly to ensure our suppliers\u2019 products are compliant and safe,\u201d Guiler said in an e-mail. \u201cWe also ensure that products that have failed testing are destroyed.\u201d Disney licensed the Toy Story characters and had the contractual right to approve all product packaging, including a warning label, Kwass said. Disney spokeswoman Tasia Filippatos referred questions to its licensee, Peachtree Playthings, also a defendant in the Tamayo family\u2019s lawsuit. Peachtree, which didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, said in court papers that its products were safe and complied with the law. The sponsor of the 2008 safety legislation worries that it isn\u2019t deterring violators. \u201cI would like to see more inspections,\u201d said former U.S. Senator Mark Pryor. \u201cIf people know that stuff is going to get caught at the border coming in, there\u2019s going to be less incentive overseas to cheat.\u201d The 2008 law\u2019s requirement that retailers hire accredited labs to test children\u2019s products for safety didn\u2019t help Ixchel Tamayo. Ixchel, who sometimes wore her curly dark hair down to her shoulders and sometimes in pigtailed braids, watched over her younger sister as the two played together in the family\u2019s apartment in northeast Philadelphia. Her leopard-print jacket, rain boots, sunglasses, tights and feathery hair ties were all in her favorite color, pink. A Spanish-language video tribute to her posted on YouTube shows Ixchel riding her pink \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d tricycle while wearing knee pads and a safety helmet. Since she loved \u201cToy Story,\u201d Minnie Mouse and crafts, the Disney-themed art set must have seemed to her doting parents like the perfect gift. Dollar Tree\u2019s original packaging for art sets with mini-markers carried a choking warning, which is required for children\u2019s toys and games with small parts. Bureau Veritas SA, the France-based lab operator used by Dollar Tree, advised the retailer to categorize the markers as writing implements, which are excluded from the limits on small parts, according to previously unreleased 2009 e-mails provided by the family\u2019s lawyer. Under the federal standard, any toy or game for children aged 3 to 6 that contains a small part must bear a choking hazard warning except for \u201cwriting materials such as crayons, chalk, pencils and pens,\u201d along with finger paints and watercolors. Some mini-marker art sets sold online by retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. carry the warning; others don\u2019t. \u201cWriting materials (pens) are exempted from the \u2018Small Part\u2019 definition,\u201d Jason Sallese, a Bureau Veritas senior program manager, wrote to Dollar Tree in June 2009. \u201cThese markers fall under this scope.\u201d Sallese said in a phone call that the Tamayo lawsuit \u201cdoesn\u2019t ring a bell.\u201d He declined to comment further. Bureau Veritas spokeswoman Margaret Collopy also declined to comment, citing client confidentiality and corporate policy. Avoiding Warnings? Some lab testers may feel beholden to their retail clients, even helping them avoid safety warnings that could hurt sales, said Susan Hoeller, a Florida attorney who specializes in product safety and regulations, speaking generally. In 2011, the federal commission started conducting systematic border inspections of imports, focusing on children\u2019s items. Data on violations prior to October 2012 were unavailable. Other federal regulators, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also inspect only a small fraction of imports. Even with limited inspections, the product safety commission has stopped 16.4 million items that failed to meet federal standards, including 823,000 destined for Dollar Tree and 705,000 for Target, from being sold since October 2012. The commission has cited violations in 62 lots bound for Dollar Tree and its subsidiary, Greenbrier International Inc., more than to any other retailer. In the past two months, the commission reported that military action figures, ninja archery play sets and toy motorcycles produced in China for Dollar Tree contained too much lead. Dollar Tree stopped sales of those toys and agreed to correct future production of them. Other safety violations in children\u2019s products bound for Dollar Tree have included cowboy play sets, toy walkie-talkies and jewelry containing lead, as well as dolls and other toys with excessive levels of phthalates, a group of chemicals used to soften plastic that has been linked to hormone disruption and birth defects. In several instances, after a factory shipped an unsafe product, Dollar Tree and Greenbrier still used the supplier a second time, the data show. The commission reported in December 2012 that Greenbrier imported toy bowling sets containing lead from supplier Yi Feng Toys Factory of China. Four months later, it cited Greenbrier for importing baby bottles with small parts from the same factory. The company hasn\u2019t used Yi Feng for almost two years, Guiler said. Yi Feng couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Toy or Pen? The velvet coloring sheets with mini-markers that killed Ixchel Tamayo weren\u2019t listed as a violation. The commission has neither investigated her death \u201cnor conducted or obtained any evaluations\u201d of the markers, it said last month in response to a public records request. Commission spokesman Scott Wolfson said markers \u201cwould likely fall within the pens category\u201d of the exemption. Wolfson declined to comment on the commission\u2019s staff investigation of Dollar Tree incidents. Generally, its investigators collect samples and test them at the commission\u2019s own lab, he said. They also may ask the company under scrutiny to turn over records. Investigations that find violations of federal standards can lead to civil penalties. For example, the commission fined General Electric Co. $3.5 million in February for knowingly failing to report electrical fires from defective Mexican-made ranges and U.S.-manufactured dishwashers in a timely fashion. There were no serious injuries, and GE doesn\u2019t admit the allegations, company spokeswoman Kim Freeman said. Zulily, an online retailer based in Seattle, ranked second behind Dollar Tree, with 55 unsafe lots. In December, the commission cited jackets, tunics, denim pants and sweater dresses made in China for Zulily for containing lead. Zulily spokeswoman Andrea Conrad said that all of its vendors are required to meet safety standards. \u201cWhile these violations represent an extremely small percentage of the products we have sold on Zulily, we take each instance seriously,\u201d she said in an e-mail. Most of Minneapolis-based Target\u2019s 34 violations involved flammable sleepwear imported from Cambodia for its exclusive Circo children\u2019s brand. \u201cWe rigorously test our owned-brand merchandise before it arrives at our stores or at Target.com,\u201d Target says on its website. \u201cFirst and foremost, we test products to validate that they meet or exceed safety and regulatory requirements.\u201d Separate from the commission\u2019s data, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit consumer advocate, cited more unsafe products from Dollar Tree than any other retailer in its November report on toy safety. The group found that Dollar Tree was selling a sheriff badge play set that contained too much lead, as well as six toys that were choking hazards. Guiler declined to comment on products cited in the report. In January, shareholders of Family Dollar Stores Inc. approved Dollar Tree\u2019s $8.81 billion takeover offer. The deal, which could close as early as this month, would make Dollar Tree the largest U.S. dollar-store chain, with about 12,000 locations. Dollar Tree\u2019s stock price, which dropped 0.5 percent on Tuesday, has increased 14 percent this year to $80.58. Family Dollar sells products at multiple prices, while Dollar Tree sells most items for $1. The federal product safety commission hasn\u2019t cited Family Dollar for any violations, according to available data. To help pay for hiring more inspectors and scrutinizing more products, the commission has proposed a \u201cuser fee\u201d on importers of about 7 cents per $1,000 of value. Groups such as the Retail Industry Leaders Association, of which Dollar Tree is a member, expressed concern last May about \u201cthe impact this new fee and program expansion would have on commerce.\u201d The Tamayo case shows how potentially dangerous products can reach U.S. shelves. Besides the lack of a warning, the markers\u2019 caps failed to meet voluntary size and design guidelines set by the ISO, or International Organization for Standardization, according to a mediation memorandum by attorneys for Tamayo\u2019s family. The product safety commission recommends that U.S. retailers follow voluntary standards. Ixchel\u2019s parents, Francisco Tamayo and Guadalupe Luis, sued Dollar Tree, Greenbrier, Disney, Pixar and Peachtree in 2013. The case was confidentially settled last year. The family was seeking a $12 million settlement, according to the mediation memo. Georgia-based Peachtree Playthings supplied the art sets to Dollar Tree, according to court documents. Any products distributed by Peachtree weren\u2019t \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d and were \u201cmanufactured, designed, inspected and labeled in conformity with the generally recognized state-of-the-art,\u201d the company said in court papers. The safety commission hasn\u2019t cited Peachtree for any violations, according to the data. Debbie Smith, a Dollar Tree senior import testing specialist, advised Bureau Veritas on June 2, 2009, that art sets with mini-markers needed a small parts warning. \u201cIt comes with markers and the lid of the markers is the small part,\u201d Smith wrote. After Bureau Veritas\u2019s Sallese disagreed, Smith sided with his interpretation of the rule. \u201cMarkers are considered to be writing utensils and writing utensils are exempt from the small parts requirement,\u201d she e-mailed two employees of Peachtree Playthings less than a week later. \u201cFor future orders of this item, please make sure the packaging does not include the small parts warning.\u201d Smith didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment. Tested as a writing tool rather than a toy, Ixchel\u2019s art set passed Bureau Veritas\u2019s inspection, according to records provided by the Tamayo family\u2019s attorneys. Dollar Tree still imports Peachtree products, according to records compiled by online trade database ImportGenius.com, and mini-marker art sets are still sold on Dollar Tree\u2019s website. A Dollar Tree store in Dorchester, Massachusetts, visited by a reporter last month, was selling two sets with mini-markers. One had a choking warning and one -- which was stamped with a 2014 date -- didn\u2019t. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s some with warnings and some without goes against the whole idea of quality assurance,\u201d said Hoeller, the Florida product safety attorney. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be the same.\u201d","timestamp":1428390000.0,"participant_ids":["DLTR:US","DIS:US","0178435D:US","BVI:FP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-07\/the-cheap-toys-you-buy-your-kid-are-rarely-inspected","subject":"The Cheap Toys You Buy Your Kid Are Rarely Inspected"},{"body":" Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. is being investigated by federal regulators after \u201c60 Minutes\u201d reported earlier this month that it sold flooring with high levels of formaldehyde. U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Elliot F. Kaye said today on a conference call that his agency is actively investigating the company and testing products dating back to 2012. The probe\u2019s results probably will be released in the coming months, Kaye said. The retailer said in an e-mailed statement that it\u2019s cooperating with the agency. Lumber Liquidators   after CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d reported on March 1 that the company sold laminate flooring that was produced in China with elevated amounts of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. The Toano, Virginia-based retailer\u2019s market value has plummeted by more than half since it disclosed that a story by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was in the works. Despite the announcement of the investigation, investors boosted the stock today, partly on the revelation that the CPSC won\u2019t use the same test that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d employed. Lumber Liquidators has repeatedly cast doubt on the news program\u2019s methods and defended the safety of its products. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a win for them,\u201d David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in New York, said in an interview. \u201cThis backs up what Lumber Liquidators has been saying all along.\u201d Strasser raised his recommendation on the company to a buy on March 3, saying fears were \u201coverblown.\u201d The shares rose 11 percent to $31.86 at the close in New York. They had declined 58 percent from Feb. 24, the day before the market first learned of the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story, through yesterday. The company has said its products are safe and that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d used improper tests that employ what\u2019s known in the industry as a \u201cdeconstructive\u201d method to determine formaldehyde levels. The CPSC won\u2019t use that method because it doesn\u2019t replicate how floors are used in the home, Kaye said, echoing Lumber Liquidators\u2019 argument. The agency would push for a recall if it finds the flooring products are hazardous, he said. The investigation, which includes other agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, is initially focusing only on flooring sold by Lumber Liquidators. \u201cWe are committed to move as fast as possible to get answers for consumers, especially the parents of young children,\u201d Kaye said. Lumber Liquidators also has tried to cast doubt by pointing out that short sellers fueled the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story. Investor Whitney Tilson went public with his shorting of the stock in 2013. He then pitched a story to \u201c60 Minutes\u201d early last year and appeared in the report. The show also featured a lawyer and the head of an environmental group who sued Lumber Liquidators after learning of a possible formaldehyde issue from the  . The retailer said earlier this month that sales   after the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report and that it would be unable to forecast revenue or profit this year because of the uncertainty it created. To help regain customers\u2019 confidence, Lumber Liquidators has offered free testing and said it would consider replacing some floors.","timestamp":1427285598.0,"participant_ids":["LL:US","13356Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-25\/lumber-liquidators-being-investigated-by-consumer-safety-agency","subject":"Lumber Liquidators Under Investigation by Consumer Agency"},{"body":" Private equity firms led by Henry Kravis\u2019s KKR & Co. reaped the most in asset sales ever last year, benefiting from a stock market rally driven by low interest rates and a U.S. economic recovery. The firms earned $428 billion in the sales, a 30 percent increase from the previous year, according to Preqin Ltd. Private equity managers also announced new investments valued at $308 billion, the most since 2007, the London-based research firm said. The $26.6 billion merger of Alliance Boots GmbH and Walgreen Co., completed on Dec. 31, gave KKR the year\u2019s biggest exit, according to Preqin. KKR, run by billionaire cousins Kravis and George Roberts, swapped its remaining stake in Alliance Boots for $4.7 billion in cash and Walgreen shares, according to a person familiar with the matter, boosting the New York-based buyout firm\u2019s total return to about $7 billion, almost three times times its original investment. The largest private equity firms, which use client money to buy companies with the intent of improving them and selling them years later at a profit, have disposed of holdings at a faster rate than they made investments since 2012, as rallying markets made sales attractive and new deals expensive. Leon Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management LLC, said in 2013 that his New York-based buyout firm was \u201cselling everything that\u2019s not nailed down,\u201d and leaders from Blackstone Group LP, Carlyle Group LP and KKR said the same was true at their firms. \u201cThe exit activity is particularly significant, as many managers were still looking to exit deals done in the pre-crisis years and have been waiting for improved selling conditions,\u201d said Christopher Elvin, Preqin\u2019s head of private equity products. Other big divestitures included Apollo\u2019s $6.8 billion sale of oil and gas producer Athlon Energy Inc. to Encana Corp., which netted Apollo $2.2 billion in profit; Blackstone\u2019s continued sale of shares in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., the most profitable private equity deal ever; and Carlyle\u2019s profit from Apple Inc.\u2019s purchase of headphone maker Beats Electronics LLC, in which Washington-based Carlyle owned a minority stake.","timestamp":1420473287.0,"participant_ids":["KKR:US","0045503D:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-05\/kravis-s-kkr-leads-record-sales-by-private-equity-firms","subject":"Kravis\u2019s KKR Leads Record Sales by Private Equity Firms"},{"body":" The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Division of Banks brought an enforcement action against State Street Corp. for weaknesses in how it manages compliance risks tied to anti-money laundering rules.

The media industry analyst has a theory for why the Mercedes-Benz AMG performance cars he owned before never provoked such a reaction from bystanders. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone expects this from Lexus,\u201d Dergarabedian, 53, said by phone from his home in Glendale, a Los Angeles suburb. As Toyota President Akio Toyoda today lays out Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s motorsports plans for the year -- including Lexus\u2019s foray on global racing circuits -- the addition of sportier cars to its once-staid luxury lineup is already drawing younger buyers and boosting sales of higher-priced models. Lexus is now pushing suppliers to ramp up output of sport seats and mesh grilles to meet demand, and pressing on with even more in-your-face designs in spite of pushback from brand loyalists with more traditional tastes. Lexus\u2019s F Sport trim vehicles are drawing customers five to 12 years younger than buyers of the equivalent base models, Executive Vice President Mark Templin said. Each F Sport model added to the Lexus lineup has exceeded the company\u2019s sales expectations, with the IS F Sport approaching half of total IS deliveries in some markets, he said. \u201cWe were in a meeting and Akio Toyoda said wow, if F Sport\u2019s become the main car, maybe we need to be more aggressive with our styling than we have been over the last couple of years,\u201d Templin said on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really bold with where we\u2019ve gone, and some people thought we were crazy.\u201d Toyoda, 58, has taken a hands-on approach to infusing Toyota\u2019s 25-year-old luxury brand with more excitement. He hands out two business cards: one for his position as company president, the other identifying him as Lexus\u2019s chief branding officer and master driver. \u201cIt has been said Lexus was a good quality car but not emotional,\u201d Toyoda said during an   in November at Lexus Intersect, an event space in Tokyo\u2019s fashionable Aoyama District. \u201cMy role and what I\u2019m doing is adding the coolness and the emotion to the brand.\u201d Lexus plans to add to its lineup in the fourth quarter the high-performance GS F mid-size sedan, which will join the RC F coupe introduced late 2014. Toyota expects to sell about 1,600 of the GS F sedans annually, Jeff Bracken, U.S. general sales manager for Lexus, said at the Detroit show. Changes to Lexus cars\u2019 looks have upset some customers. Bracken said he\u2019s fielded 45-minute phone calls with Lexus buyers who oppose the spindle grilles that have become a hallmark of the brand\u2019s styling since the company redesigned the GS in 2011. \u201cWhile I might not be able to turn them and we may have to kind of agree to disagree, at the end of the day we\u2019re OK with that,\u201d Bracken said in an interview. \u201cThat polarizing effect is, candidly, part of the strategy. If we didn\u2019t do that, we wouldn\u2019t be able to bring folks to the brand that haven\u2019t been considering us before.\u201d In addition to debuting GS F in Detroit, Bracken showed a   concept that he said signaled Lexus\u2019s first global racing effort. Starting this year in Europe and in the U.S. in 2016, the brand plans to build on its existing presence in Japan\u2019s series. Toyoda has said motorsports will trickle down and inform development of the company\u2019s cars. Dergarabedian, who bought his RC F in November, said he fibbed to the police officer who stopped him last month by assuring him he\u2019d only open up the throttle on a race track. \u201cIt used to be that Lexus automobiles were not known for getting your pulse pounding,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you have brands like AMG at Mercedes out there, the M Series BMWs, you have to have some element of that to give your line credibility.

Tripodi will oversee marketing, product quality and food safety for the chain, Subway said in a statement on Thursday. He previously served as chief marketing and commercial officer for Coca-Cola, and held similar roles at Allstate Insurance Co., Bank of New York, Seagram Spirits & Wine and MasterCard International. Subway is reeling from a tumultuous year and slowing growth. In September, Subway\u2019s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Fred DeLuca died, putting the   in the hands of his sister, Suzanne Greco. In November, former spokesman Jared Fogle   to more than 15 years after pleading guilty to child-pornography charges, ending a scandal that had rocked the sandwich chain for months. Consumers\u2019 preferences also are changing, forcing Subway to adapt. As customers seek more natural foods, Subway is working to maintain its image as the healthy fast-food option. In October, Subway said it was switching to meat raised without antibiotics next year in the U.S. \u201cAs consumers\u2019 tastes evolve, I want to build on Subway\u2019s legacy of innovation to ensure we are always leading in our marketing, product offerings and consumer engagement strategies,\u201d Tripodi said in Thursday\u2019s statement. Tripodi has a master\u2019s degree from the London School of Economics and a bachelor\u2019s in economics from Harvard. The 60-year-old spent almost eight years as Coca-Cola\u2019s marketing chief.

The change, which affects sandwiches, salads, soups and cookies, will be made gradually over the next 18 months, according to a statement from the closely held company. As part of the effort, Subway also will roll out a new roast beef recipe to its 27,000 U.S. locations.

Finance Minister Pawel Szalamacha said Friday he would increase the 2015 shortfall by as much as 4 billion zloty ($1 billion) in an \u201cemergency\u201d revision caused by lower-than-expected tax receipts.\u00a0While bonds fell for the first time in five days on Monday after the announcement, the move is neutral for the debt market as the new cabinet\u00a0probably decided to push back some non-tax revenue or bring forward expenditures to\u00a0create room to meet campaign promises, according to Piotr Kalisz at Citigroup Inc. The government,\u00a0which was elected in October on plans to increase public spending, likely wants to level out deficits for this year and next to meet European Union targets and avoid endangering access to funding, according to ING Groep NV. Poland must find cash for as much as 30 billion zloty in new budget spending next year, Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told Do Rzeczy magazine on Monday. \u201cIt looks as if this is just shuffling of expenditure and revenue between 2015 and 2016,\u201d said Citigroup\u2019s Kalisz said. \u201cThe amount of bonds issued over the next year and a half will be the same.\u201d The yield on Poland\u2019s 10-year securities was little changed at 2.68 percent at 4:41 p.m. in Warsaw. That left the premium investors demand to own Polish debt over similar-maturity German bunds little changed near a one-week high of 221 basis points and within six basis points of the highest in almost two months reached on Nov. 9. The budget gap, set by the previous cabinet at 46.1 billion zloty, will widen by 3 billion zloty to 4 billion zloty as revenue from taxes, mainly the value-added tax, is running 12 billion zloty short of the plan, the Finance Ministry said last week. Szalamacha refined the shortfall estimate to 3.8 billion to 3.9 billion zloty in an article published by Rzeczpospolita on Tuesday. He told the daily he wanted to stay within the EU deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product, though there could\u00a0be an event that sends it above. The revision won\u2019t affect issuance as Poland has more than offset the increase with improved liquidity management in its public finances, Piotr Marczak, head of the ministry\u2019s public debt department, said on Monday. The budget has a revenue shortfall of 10.4 billion zloty this year, the government said in an e-mailed statement after its meeting on Tuesday. It will hold a press conference on this year\u2019s budget on Wednesday. The move\u00a0to increase the 2015 deficit was probably designed to help the government adhere to the EU deficit limit, said Jakub Rybacki, an economist at ING\u2019s Polish unit. Poland exited the EU\u2019s so-called excessive deficit procedure this year after the Civic Platform-led government pledged to narrow the gap to 2.8 percent of GDP this year and next. \u201cThis move should help keep next year\u2019s budget deficit in check,\u201d Rybacki said on Monday.","timestamp":1448917201.0,"participant_ids":["C:US","INGA:NA"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-30\/citigroup-to-ing-see-silver-lining-in-poland-s-budget-shortfall","subject":"Citigroup to ING See Silver Lining in Poland's Budget Shortfall"},{"body":" Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. will help fund a technology center at Carnegie Mellon University where it will provide researchers as well as recruit in areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence. The school will announce the $35 million donation Tuesday to fund the 40,000-square-foot center at its campus in Pittsburgh. The collaboration was born at the World Economic Forum in China last year where university President Subra Suresh and Tata Consultancy\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Natarajan Chandrasekaran served on a panel. The conversation continued at a visit to the school and then at the winter meeting of the summit in January in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cPeople coming out of universities are the future leaders of industry,\u201d Suresh said in an interview. \u201cWe thought it was only natural for potential collaboration.\u201d Universities like Carnegie Mellon are experiencing more demand from high-tech companies that want facilities located on or near campus.

The two terrorists who killed a dozen people at the newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris had Microsoft e-mail accounts stored on servers in the U.S., and 45 minutes later their contents were en route to the agency, to be shared with French authorities. The company hasn\u2019t always been so eager to comply. A year earlier, it rebuffed a request from the Department of Justice for a suspected drug trafficker\u2019s e-mails. Those were in a data center in Dublin -- and according to Microsoft, the arm of American law enforcement doesn\u2019t extend to Ireland. That set in motion a legal challenge putting Microsoft and its general counsel,\u00a0Brad Smith, in the lead of a charged battle between the U.S. technology industry and the U.S. government. Microsoft has lost twice. In seven days its lawyers will make their arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York. More than two dozen companies, including Apple Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., have filed briefs on Microsoft\u2019s behalf in the case, which is about due process and the right to privacy, and money. Internet service providers may be hard-pressed to sell Web-based products if they can\u2019t promise that digital records stowed in foreign countries will be protected by those countries\u2019 laws -- and from unilateral U.S. search-and-seizure missions. \u201cSome public-sector companies say, \u2018I cannot put my data in the data center of an American company unless you win this case,\u201d\u2019 Smith, 56, said from Microsoft\u2019s campus in Redmond, Washington. \u201cI have had that said to me on multiple occasions.\u201d The U.S. government\u2019s contention is that it can demand electronic data anywhere U.S. companies keep them, and that it doesn\u2019t need to ask a local jurisdiction\u2019s permission. A magistrate and a federal judge have agreed. If Microsoft doesn\u2019t prevail in the appeal, Smith said it will go to the U.S. Supreme Court. Microsoft is engaged in similar battles in Belgium and Brazil, where an executive faces criminal charges because the company has refused to turn over Skype records. The Ireland fight is viewed as critical: Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Google Inc. and others have spent billions to build data centers in other countries, in part to be able to assure foreign clients of their data\u2019s security, and Microsoft\u2019s losing the case could jeopardize that. Edward Snowden\u2019s exposure of clandestine data collection by the U.S. -- sometimes with industry collaboration -- has already cost companies. They could   more than $35 billion in sales by 2016 because of doubts about the security of their cloud-based systems, according to the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. But Smith said he\u2019s also fighting for higher-minded reasons. \u201cThere are certain issues of principle that it\u2019s important to stand up to defend,\u201d he said. However fast technology advances, \u201ctimeless values should endure. Privacy is a timeless value.\u201d There\u2019s irony in any tech company confronting the government on privacy matters, considering how much heat many take for mining their own customer information and using it for advertising and other profitable purposes. JP Schmetz, chief scientist at German publisher Hubert Burda Media, which owns Focus magazine, agrees with Microsoft in the Ireland case -- and makes sure his company runs Windows on machines with settings to keep user data from being shared with the company. Dominic Carr, a Microsoft spokesman, said the company meets \u201cthe most stringent international cloud compliance standards\u201d for privacy and security but added, \u201cAs we advocate for stronger privacy protections for customers we recognize that companies should also be held to a high standard.\u201d Microsoft has been among the most aggressive in the industry in challenging the U.S. on its access to customers\u2019 information. In 2013, Smith wrote a   post pledging the company would protect them \u201cfrom government snooping\u201d and \u201ctechnological brute force.\u201d He said this year that the Ireland case was a good one to go to the mat over, because the records are stored in a friendly country, \u201cnot Iran,\u201d and the U.S. investigation doesn\u2019t involve national security. The circumstances are different from those in the Charlie Hebdo instance, when France used its law enforcement treaty with the U.S. to make its request through the FBI. The U.S. didn\u2019t follow treaty protocols or contact Irish authorities before demanding the e-mails from the Dublin data center. According to the U.S., working through treaties is slow and cumbersome and not required by law, and the lower courts agreed. Ireland is backing Microsoft in court; the company\u2019s getting support from the left and right, from the American Civil Liberties Union to Fox News. In the early days of computing, people kept programs on their machines at home or in the office. Now that so much data\u2019s in the cloud, on third-party systems that rent out storage and computing space, it can get complicated when a government makes a demand. It could come from, say, Singapore for communications between Canada and Germany that are warehoused in Australia. \u201cThese are the most far-fetched law school hypotheticals you could ever come up with -- except they are coming true, said Nuala O\u2019Connor, chief executive officer of the Center for Democracy & Technology. Microsoft was confronted with one in January when, Smith said, police burst past the gates of the Sao Paulo apartment of a top executive and ordered he appear in court because the company hadn\u2019t given up records of a Brazilian\u2019s Skype calls. While failing to do so violates Brazilian law, if Microsoft did forfeit them it would be breaching U.S. wiretapping bans.The executive faces misdemeanor criminal charges in Brazil; Microsoft could be accused of a felony in the U.S. \u201cIt meets the legal definition of a mess,\u201d Smith said. A 22-year Microsoft veteran, Smith has been pushing back against government requests since he became general counsel in 2002. That year, the U.S. National Security Agency asked telephone and Internet companies to voluntarily give the agency access to bulk communications content, an appeal outlined in a document Snowden leaked. It notes that one, Company F, declined. That, Smith revealed later, was Microsoft. He and then-Chief Executive Office Steve Ballmer thought hard about it, knowing their decision would \u201cneed to stand the test of time,\u201d he said in a speech to the Brookings Institution. Smith, who led Microsoft\u2019s support for gay marriage in Washington state, is an uncommon general counsel in the industry, one more widely involved in political and social issues that \u201cother companies are hoping they can avoid,\u201d said Anne Marie Slaughter, CEO of the New American Foundation, who got to know Smith when they were students at Princeton University\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, in a group of friends that included U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan and former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. The U.S. and other countries should work on a legal framework for cross-border data-access protocols, Smith said. In Brazil, Microsoft is caught in a \u201cfiring line between two sets of laws,\u201d just one of \u201cwhat will be many instances like this if governments don\u2019t come together to put their laws on a similar path.\u201d \u00a0 Think of what would happen, he said, if China demanded the e-mails of a U.S. citizen kept in the data-storage center that Chinese Internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is opening in Santa Clara, California. \u201cDo we want American privacy rights to be subject to foreign laws rather than our own?\u201d he said. \u201cIf the answer is no, we better decide we\u2019re not going to try to impose our law on other people.\u201d","timestamp":1441173660.0,"participant_ids":["MSFT:US","MSFT:US","AAPL:US","AAPL:US","AMZN:US","AMZN:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-02\/as-microsoft-takes-on-the-feds-apple-and-amazon-watch-nervously","subject":"The Case That Has Microsoft, Apple and Amazon Agreeing for Once"},{"body":" Faced with a   market slide that has wiped out $5 trillion in trading value, China is again on the prowl for scapegoats. Authorities announced a probe of allegations of market malpractice involving the stocks regulator on Tuesday, while the official Xinhua News Agency called for efforts to \u201cpurify\u201d the capital markets. The news service also carried remarks by a central bank researcher attributing the global rout to an expected Federal Reserve rate increase. The Shanghai Composite Index has plunged more than 40 percent from its peak, after concerns over the Chinese economy helped snap a months-long rally   by state-run media. Authorities have repeatedly   market manipulators and foreign forces since the sell off began in June and led officials to launch an unprecedented stocks-support program. Now, after   that program, the administration has embarked on a new round of allegations and fault-finding. \u201cThe authorities have been too involved in the stock market and now they\u2019re trying to pass the responsibilities to others,\u201d said Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology. \u201cIn fact, they have to be responsible for the market crisis. It\u2019s the authorities trying to act like a referee and a player at the same time.\u201d Police are investigating people connected to the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Citic Securities Co. and Caijing magazine on suspicion of offenses including illegal securities trading and spreading false information, Xinhua reported. They\u2019re probing suspects linked to the CSRC, including a former employee, over insider trading and forging official document stamps, Xinhua said. Eight people at Citic Securities are suspected of illegal securities trading and the Caijing employees are under investigation for allegedly fabricating and spreading fake stock and futures trading information. Citic Securities said Wednesday in a statement posted to the Shanghai stock exchange that it hasn\u2019t received notice related to the report and said the company\u2019s operating as normal. Caijing in a statement Wednesday confirmed a reporter had been summoned by police. The magazine said it didn\u2019t know the reason and would cooperate with authorities. Calls and a fax to the CSRC went unanswered. Meanwhile, Xinhua published a commentary urging stricter enforcement to cleanse the markets. \u201cWe have reason to believe that more criminals and their hidden crimes will be exposed,\u201d it said. \u201cWe also believe judicial departments will investigate thoroughly and impose punishments no matter who is involved in crimes.\u201d The probes will help make the \u201cChinese stock market a just place and give the market a future that is healthy and stable,\u201d it said. Another Xinhua report citing Yao Yudong, head of the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s Research Institute of Finance, attributed the global market rout to expectation of a Fed rate increase in September, not concern about the Chinese economy. Separately, Haitong Securities Co., GF Securities Co., Huatai Securities Co. and   -- four of China\u2019s largest brokerages -- said they\u2019re being investigated by the CSRC on suspicion of failing to comply with identity verification and \u201cknow-your-clients\u201d requirements, according to statements to the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges Tuesday. \u201cThe company will fully cooperate with the CSRC and strictly fulfill any obligations of information disclosure under regulatory requirements,\u201d Haitong said in its statement. \u201cSo far, the business of the company is under normal operations.\u201d GF, Huatai and Founder made similar pledges of cooperation with the probes in their filings. The actions ease investors\u2019 concerns by showing that the government will prosecute activities that could destabilize the market, said Han Meng, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences\u2019 Institute of Economics in Beijing. \u201cAt this volatile moment, it\u2019s very important for authorities to demonstrate the determination to crack down on illegal activities that could disrupt the market,\u201d Han said. In July, the Ministry of Public Security said it\u2019d help the CSRC investigate evidence of \u201cmalicious\u201d short selling of stocks and indexes. Vice Public Security Minister Meng Qingfeng visited the regulator\u2019s offices in Beijing, in a pointed message to violators. Hu, the economics professor, said government cheerleading for the rally helped push the market to an unreasonable level. \u201cThe authorities carry the greatest responsibility for the crisis because they tried to push forward the market by intervening and encouraging the public to go mad in the stock market,\u201d Hu said.","timestamp":1440498133.0,"participant_ids":["3904771Z:CH","3904771Z:CH"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-25\/haitong-faces-china-probe-for-suspected-client-rules-violation","subject":"China Authorities Escalate Blame Game as Stock Slide Worsens"},{"body":"SAP SE has become the latest big technology company to throw its weight behind open-source data-sifting software called Spark as it tackles information streaming from industries such as retail, telecommunications and transport. The German company is releasing software this month called Hana Vora, which lets customers combine business data stored in SAP\u2019s Hana database with information from industrial sensors, phone networks and other sources stored in Spark. SAP joins companies including International Business Machines Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. in supporting Spark,\u00a0which can quickly process data using groups of low-cost servers. \u201cThis is lubricant -- it makes it easier to bring that data into the business context,\u201d said SAP Chief Technology Officer Quentin Clark. The  , for example, ensures incoming goods can be loaded onto trucks around one of Europe\u2019s busiest ports as efficiently as possible by processing different types of data in tandem. The port combines data from sensors on the trucks flowing into in open-source tools with information about the movement of goods that\u2019s stored in SAP\u2019s business applications. SAP, the largest maker of business applications for financial and human-resources management, is seeking to expand beyond its traditional strongholds. Embracing new data-processing technology like Spark is important for SAP as it tries to build share for its Hana product, which has just 6.3 percent of the $34 billion global database market. That compares with 46.2 percent for Oracle and 19.4 percent for Microsoft, according to market researcher IDC. Shares of SAP advanced 0.1 percent to 58.79 euros at 9:49 a.m. in Frankfurt. The stock is little changed this year. Originally developed at the University of California at Berkeley, Spark is seen as a successor to the widely used Hadoop tools for analyzing so-called big data, since it\u2019s able to load huge sets into fast computer memory. IBM is   more than 3,500 researchers and developers to Spark and building the software into its analysis and e-commerce products.

Silicon Valley startups are building new businesses on the technology too. Databricks Inc., which is cooperating with IBM, in June delivered a set of online tools for developers to manage Spark projects. Origami Logic Inc. applies big-data processing to help track marketing campaigns. Combining large data sets from industrial sensors or video tracking of retail shoppers with information from business systems is becoming more important as companies capitalize on an area called the industrial Internet.

Good Technology, based in Sunnyvale, California, builds applications to help employees work securely from their personal phones. It counts all of the G7 governments and the world\u2019s 10 largest banks and law firms among its 6,200 customers, BlackBerry said in a statement Friday. The acquisition removes a rival that had taken some of BlackBerry\u2019s clients as more workers switched from employer-provided BlackBerrys to their own iPhones and Android devices. \u201cSometimes your best defense is a good offence,\u201d said John Butler, senior handsets analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThis is good for BlackBerry in the sense that it gives them greater scale and therefore a greater ability to compete with larger rivals.\u201d Bigger tech companies such as SAP SE, Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. can sell tools to track mobile devices at cheaper prices by bundling them in with larger software sales, Butler said. BlackBerry will bring together Good Technology\u2019s secure e-mailing apps with its expertise in helping companies manage and secure thousands of connected tablets and phones, Chief Executive Officer John Chen said on a conference call. \u201cBlackBerry and Good combined will raise the bar in the enterprise mobility market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are expecting significant operating expense synergies.\u201d Good Technology   a planned initial public offering last year because of worsening market conditions, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Selling to BlackBerry makes sense for both customers and shareholders, Good Technology CEO Christy Wyatt said in a phone interview. Earlier this month, a jury found MobileIron Inc. didn\u2019t infringe Good Technology\u2019s patents and that some of those patents were invalid. That could potentially have impacted the company\u2019s valuation, said Matt Larson, a technology patents litigation analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThe litigation with MobileIron certainly called into question the enforceability of some of these patents and the underlying strength of some of their existing agreements,\u201d he said. Good Technology\u2019s revenue from intellectual property represented only about $25 million of the $200 million yearly revenue, Chen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a component,\u201d he said. BlackBerry could be in a better position to monetize Good Technology\u2019s patents by bundling them into its existing licensing deals, Larson said. \u201cWhen you have the added clout that BlackBerry offers they may be able to bring that licensing revenue up,\u201d he said. BlackBerry expects to book around $160 million revenue from Good Technology in the first year, after writing down some of the company\u2019s deferred revenue, Chen said. That would help the CEO hit his goal of doubling yearly software revenue to $500 million by March 2016. BlackBerry rose 0.5 percent to C$9.91 at 1:21 p.m. in Toronto.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has been \"walking around with olive branches in his hand and still nothing has happened,\" Mucic said, referring to Benioff\u2019s comments in July that he was seeking more cooperation with SAP. \"At this valuation level I fail to see that this would be an attractive acquisition target for anyone,\" he said. Salesforce has a market value of $46 billion. SAP shares are little changed this year compared with a 4 percent rise in the Bloomberg European Technology Index as investors bear with the company through a transition to software sold as online subscriptions, which is keeping profit growth in check. SAP is rolling out a major update to its core software for running finance, manufacturing and logistics at tens of thousands of businesses, called S\/4, and it\u2019s expanding the capabilities of its Hana database. At the same time, it\u2019s adding sales of online services gained through acquisitions including Concur Technologies. SAP is focused on paying down debt and financial flexibility will increase after 2017, according to Mucic, who said many small business software companies \"are crazily valued.\" SAP plans to reduce its overall debt level to about 9.3 billion euros ($10.4 billion) by the end of this year, from roughly 11 billion euros now, Mucic said. In January, SAP pared its 2015 profit forecast as it replaces traditional license sales, in which it is paid up-front, with subscriptions. A Morgan Stanley analysis published on July 27 showed that SAP is more than offsetting revenue declines from its software license business with new cloud-computing sales. At the same time, the company is cutting jobs. It is removing about 3,000 positions this year, or about 3 percent of the total, on top of a similar reduction last year.","timestamp":1441887136.0,"participant_ids":["SAP:US","CRM:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-10\/sap-finance-chief-says-company-done-with-big-m-a-deals-for-now","subject":"SAP Finance Chief Says Company Done With Big M&A Deals for Now"},{"body":"The cost for Japan\u2019s biggest banks to deal with soured loans all but disappeared in the first half as bankruptcies plunged. Mizuho Financial Group Inc.\u2019s lending arms had credit costs of just 400 million yen ($3.3 million) in the first half, down from 539.3 billion yen in the year ended March 2009 during the global financial crisis. Bad-debt ratios at the main banking units of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. fell to record lows in the six months ended Sept. 30. The two lenders took the cash set aside to cover delinquencies and booked it as profit, reports showed this month. Declining credit costs since the worldwide meltdown have helped the three banking groups protect profit that has been under pressure from shrinking lending margins. Unprecedented monetary easing to revive the economy has lowered interest rates, making it easier for Japanese corporate borrowers to repay loans and stay in business, with bankruptcies tumbling to a 25-year low in August. \u201cWe may have seen the peak in reversals of credit provisions,\u201d\u00a0said Akira Takai, a Tokyo-based analyst at Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Japan\u2019s second-biggest brokerage. \u201cBut with a recovering economy, credit expenses should remain low and stable.\u201d Mitsubishi UFJ\u2019s main lending units clawed back\u00a022.5 billion yen of reserves\u00a0that had been set aside for non-performing loans in the six months ended Sept. 30. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. reversed provisions of 27.6 billion yen and expects to record zero bad-debt costs for the year ending March. Mitsubishi UFJ is forecasting credit expenses of 5 billion yen at its banking units and Mizuho projects 50 billion yen in costs. Non-performing claims at the lending units of Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan\u2019s biggest bank, totaled 1.16 trillion yen as of Sept. 30, making up a record-low 1.08 percent of total loans. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking\u2019s bad debts accounted for an unprecedented 0.85 percent of loans, and at Mizuho\u2019s units they made up 1.06 percent. Credit costs \u201cremain at low levels,\u201d Japanese Bankers Association Chairman Yasuhiro Sato said on Nov. 19. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a crucial point in cementing the economic recovery and ensuring this leads to growth over the medium to long term.\u201d The three so-called megabank groups earned a combined 1.4 trillion yen of net income in the fiscal first half. While that\u2019s down 3 percent from a year earlier, it represents 59 percent of their combined annual profit target. Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ have climbed 21 percent this year,\u00a0Mizuho has gained 25 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui is up 9.8 percent. Net income at companies in the Topix stock index, excluding financial firms, increased 17 percent in the six months ended Sept. 30, according to SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. Japanese corporate bankruptcies have fallen every month this year except March, and the number of cases dropped to 632 in August, the lowest since 1990, Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd. data show. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a rise in bankruptcies in Japan,\u201d\u00a0said Makoto Kuroda, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo. \u201cLow and stable credit costs are likely to continue.\u201d On a consolidated basis, the three lenders are forecasting combined credit expenses will climb to 300 billion yen this fiscal year from 174 billion yen a year earlier. Daiwa\u2019s Takai said the anticipated increase at the group level is due to costs in areas outside of traditional banking such as consumer finance. Japanese banks, which have been expanding lending abroad, probably won\u2019t experience a surge in bad-loan costs overseas, JPMorgan\u2019s Kuroda said.

Sean Connolly, who led Hillshire Brands until its acquisition by Tyson Foods Inc. last year, will take the reins on April 6, ConAgra said on Thursday in a statement. Connolly faces the challenge of reviving growth at ConAgra, whose roster of brands includes Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher\u2019s and Reddi-wip. Sales have declined for three straight quarters, and the company just cut its profit forecast. Connolly\u2019s history of burnishing brands makes him a good fit for the job, Chairman Steve Goldstone said on Thursday. \u201cWe are confident he will infuse focus and enthusiasm at ConAgra Foods,\u201d Goldstone said in the statement. In addition to running Hillshire, the 49-year-old Connolly previously served as CEO of Sara Lee North American Retail and Foodservice. He also was a president for Campbell Soup Co.\u2019s North American division. Connolly will join ConAgra on March 3 as CEO-elect and work with Rodkin on the transition. His previous company, Hillshire, was   for about $7.8 billion last year. The deal allowed Tyson to expand further into the market for prepared, processed foods by adding retail brands such as Ball Park hot dogs and State Fair corn dogs. In a separate statement on Thursday, ConAgra said the strong dollar and weaker-than-expected sales of private brands were hurting results. The company now projects 2015 earnings of $2.13 to $2.18 a share, below the $2.26 that analysts had estimated. The shares fell as much as 6.6 percent to $34 in late trading after the forecast was released. ConAgra also blamed the labor dispute at West Coast ports for putting a damper on earnings. The company joins a host of packaged-foods companies suffering from sluggish demand and currency headwinds. Campbell Soup also cut its annual forecast on Thursday, sending its shares down as much as 5.7 percent to $45.01 in extended trading.","timestamp":1423770485.0,"participant_ids":["CAG:US","HSH:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-12\/conagra-foods-names-hillshire-brands-sean-connolly-as-next-ceo","subject":"ConAgra Names Former Hillshire Chief Connolly as Next CEO"},{"body":"Doug Field never considered leaving Apple. From the summer of 2008 to the fall of 2013, Field, a former chief technology officer for Segway and development engineer for Ford, oversaw product and hardware design, working on the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the iMac. He earned a generous salary and was excited by the work. Then Elon Musk and Tesla Motors came calling, and Field agreed to become vice president of its vehicle program. In the October\u00a02013 announcement of his hiring, Field said joining Tesla was \u201can opportunity for me and many others to pursue the dream of building the best cars in the world\u2014while being part of one of the most innovative companies in Silicon Valley.\u201d He likely won\u2019t be the last Apple executive poached by Tesla. The company has hired at least 150 former Apple employees, more than from any other company, even carmakers. The former Apple staffers work in many areas of the 6,000-employee automaker, including engineering and law. \u201cFrom a design philosophy, [Apple] is relatively closely aligned,\u201d says Musk, Tesla\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer. Apple declined to comment for this story. As cars become  , and traditional U.S. automakers struggle to  , Tesla\u2019s ability to lure people from Apple gives it an edge in developing cars of the future. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an unfair advantage,\u201d says Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley. \u201cAs software goes from 10\u00a0percent of the value of the car to 60\u00a0over 10 years, that disadvantage [for traditional carmakers] will intensify.\u201d Employees who have worked at Apple say their decision to join Tesla was based on its cars and its CEO. Musk has a  , like Steve Jobs did, for a mercurial temper and an obsessive attention to detail. A former Tesla worker who didn\u2019t want to be named says that Musk is enamored with Apple and relishes comparisons between himself and its co-founder. Tesla, says one Silicon Valley recruiter who asked not to be named, attracts the same kind of employees that Apple does\u2014driven, hard-charging, and drawn to a strong leader. Apple\u2019s influence at Tesla is apparent in the   full-size sedan, which went on sale in 2012. The luxury electric car, priced from about $70,000, has a 17-inch touchscreen that controls most functions, from opening the panoramic roof to turning on the air conditioning, and has Internet access. As with an iPhone or an iPad, Tesla\u2019s operating system gets frequent wireless updates. \u201cWhen you talk to people in Silicon Valley, there\u2019s a totally different mindset. They look at Detroit as old\u201d Brennan Boblett, a former Apple designer, developed the car\u2019s control screen with a team of Apple alumni, including Joe Nuxoll, a freelance design consultant who\u2019s worked at both companies. \u201cYou try to design it so that it requires not a whole lot of thinking,\u201d Nuxoll says. \u201cIt\u2019s more like an iPhone than a Ford.\u201d One of Tesla\u2019s first employees from Apple was George Blankenship, who made the leap in 2010 after helping to create the company\u2019s retail stores. Musk hired him to do the same for Tesla. \u201cEverything Tesla did was unique for the auto industry,\u201d says Blankenship, who made $1.2\u00a0million in 2012, according to a Tesla proxy statement. He left Tesla the next year. \u201cIf you go back to Apple 15 years ago whenever I started there, basically everything we did there was counter to the industry as well,\u201d he says. According to LinkedIn profiles, former Apple employees at Tesla now include: Rich Heley who joined Tesla in 2013 as senior director for manufacturing technology and is now vice president for product excellence; Lynn Miller, hired last year as associate general counsel; Beth Loeb Davies, director of training programs since May\u00a02011; and Nick Kalayjian, a director of power electronics who has been awarded several patents for his work at Tesla, which he joined in 2006. \u201cElon has explained to me that it\u2019s easy for him to hire someone from Apple, because when he does the interview process for a serious software engineer\u2014a big human asset\u2014he\u2019ll meet with the person and geek out with them,\u201d says Morgan Stanley\u2019s Jonas. \u201cThey\u2019ll like talk about nerd software coding stuff.\u201d Beyond design, Apple\u2019s influence is evident in Tesla stores and how the company operates other aspects of its business. When it wanted to build a giant battery factory, it considered following Apple to Mesa, Ariz., where the computer company purchased a factory in 2013. Tesla executives met with city leaders to explore the incentives available to them before deciding the company would  . \u201cA lot of their executives and people had come from Apple, so they were very much aware of us,\u201d Christopher Brady, Mesa city manager, said in an interview last year. \u201cWhen they sat down with us, we started talking about how we had done things with Apple, and they said, \u2018You don\u2019t have to explain that to us. We already know about the Apple story.\u2019\u2009\u201d Automakers from around the world are rushing to set up offices in the Bay Area to tap the engineering talent. \u201cWhen you talk to people in Silicon Valley, there\u2019s a totally different mindset. They look at Detroit as old,\u201d says Dave Sullivan, an automotive analyst for research firm AutoPacific. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that same innovation.\u201d Sullivan says he doesn\u2019t know of any former Apple employees at traditional automakers he regularly deals with. When Ford opened a Silicon Valley office in January, it highlighted the hiring of a midlevel engineer from Apple in a news release to raise its profile in Silicon Valley. Musk says Apple has been trying to poach Tesla employees, too, offering $250,000 signing bonuses and 60\u00a0percent salary increases. \u201cApple tries very hard to recruit from Tesla,\u201d he says. \u201cBut so far they\u2019ve actually recruited very few people.\u201d","timestamp":1423168127.0,"participant_ids":["AAPL:US","TSLA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-05\/want-elon-musk-to-hire-you-at-tesla-work-for-apple","subject":"Want Elon Musk to Hire You at Tesla?

Now, the continent is a key region of the end game in global brewing consolidation as Anheuser-Busch InBev weighs an offer for its biggest rival. AB InBev would gain access to more than $7 billion in African revenue by acquiring SABMiller, whose brands in the region include Castle lager and Carling Black Label. The company generates almost one-third of its revenue and profit from Africa, the world\u2019s fastest-growing beer market, and has a dominant share in countries like Botswana, Mozambique, and Tanzania. About 65 million Africans are due to reach the legal drinking age by 2023, and AB InBev would like to serve them a Budweiser. \u201cWe believe the jewel in SABMiller\u2019s crown is its cost advantage and growth opportunities in several African markets,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham in a note written before Wednesday\u2019s announcement that the companies were in talks. \u201cIt has the scale, concentrated locally, to hold a cost advantage over competitors.\u201d A combined ABI-SAB entity would derive 12 percent of revenue and 9 percent of profit from Africa, according to analysts at Fitch, giving AB InBev a firm foothold in a region where it currently has no presence. SABMiller owns 20 percent of French drinks maker Groupe Castel, a stake it could jettison in the event of a deal, analysts say. In turn, Castel has a 38 percent stake in SABMiller\u2019s Africa business. Winning over African consumers isn\u2019t easy, which is where SABMiller\u2019s local knowledge comes in. More than half of the African alcohol market is so-called informal booze, which includes homemade traditional brews that can be harmful and have led to deaths in countries like Kenya and Mozambique. SABMiller has taken steps to move consumers to its more modern brands, which also include soft drinks. In Mozambique, SABMiller has used marketing and new products to double the per-capita beer consumption since 2000, according to an investor presentation. And in November, the company announced the formation of the biggest Coca-Cola Co. bottler in Africa. Still, not everyone is convinced by Africa\u2019s promise, and falling oil prices have weighed on growth prospects in places like Nigeria. In July, SAB\u2019s Zimbabwean partner Delta Corporation said it would reduce employee headcount to address falling sales of lager and sparkling drinks. If SAB managers in Africa leave the company after the merger, that would jeopardize AB InBev\u2019s ability to capitalize on the region\u2019s growth. \u201cWe think the justification that an acquisition of SABMiller is focused on capturing African growth is misguided,\u201d analysts at Nomura said in a note earlier this year. If there is an opportunity to sell SABMiller\u2019s African business, \u201cwe believe that ABI would consider it.\u201d","timestamp":1442397532.0,"participant_ids":["SAB:LN","ABI:BB"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-16\/abinbev-eyes-african-prize-in-pursuit-of-brewer-sabmiller","subject":"ABInBev Eyes African Prize in Pursuit of Brewer SABMiller"},{"body":" The U.S. government confirmed a case of bird flu in Arkansas as the disease spreads into the southeast of the country, the heart of the domestic poultry industry. The H5N2 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in Boone County, Arkansas, a unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a   Wednesday. The disease has spread this month after appearing in a migratory route along the Mississippi River. Previously, the outbreak that started in mid-December was contained in western states. Butterball LLC, the largest U.S. turkey, said Wednesday that the virus has affected farms that supply the company. Cargill Inc. said that Missouri\u2019s agriculture agency indicated preliminary positive tests in two flocks, including a company contract site. China has halted all U.S. poultry imports since January. Mexico, the top importer of U.S. chicken and turkey, expanded bans this week to restrict shipments from other states with cases in commercial flocks: California, Missouri and Minnesota, the top turkey producer. The European Union, Guatemala, Jordan and more than a dozen other countries have also restricted some U.S. shipments. \u201cIt seems to be spreading fast,\u201d Ron Plain, a livestock economist at the University of Missouri in Columbia, said in a telephone interview. \u201cA lot of our foreign customers will stop purchases from impacted states.\u201d The Arkansas and Jasper County, Missouri, turkey operations affected by the virus are contract farms that supply to Garner, North Carolina-based Butterball, Stephanie Llorente, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. Cargill said in an e-mail that Missouri\u2019s preliminary positive results for the H5N2 virus included a company contract farm close to Fortuna, Missouri. \u201cOur first concern is always the health and safety of the people who enjoy our products, as well as the care and well-being of our turkeys,\u201d Llorente said. Springdale, Arkansas, is the home of Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. chicken producer. The company\u2019s shares fell the most since June after Reuters earlier reported the suspected case in the state. No flocks grown for the company have been diagnosed with avian influenza, spokesman Worth Sparkman said in an e-mail. Shares of Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., the second-biggest U.S. chicken producer, tumbled as much as 9 percent. Closely held Butterball is the top turkey producer. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride is based in Greeley, Colorado. Cargill, one of the world\u2019s biggest agriculture companies, said flu tests at almost 80 farms within a 12-mile (19-kilometer) radius of the operation cited by the state of Missouri state were negative. Closely held Cargill, based in Minneapolis, said no company flock in Arkansas tested positive. \u201cThis is a big problem, especially for our turkey industry,\u201d James Sumner, the president of the Stone Mountain, Georgia-based USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. \u201cWe were in Mexico this week meeting with government officials and trying to prevail upon them to treat this as we treat it.\u201d This outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza is the first in U.S. commercial poultry since 2004.

AGL Resources\u2019 shareholders will receive $66 for each share they own, the Atlanta-based companies said in a joint statement Monday. That represents a 38 percent premium to the Aug. 21 closing price. The transaction is the largest on record for Southern, which has been increasing gas use over coal to supply its 4.5 million electricity customers in four Southeastern states.

AGL owns gas utilities with 4.5 million customers in seven states and is a partner in several pipeline projects. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to approval of shareholders of AGL as well as state regulators in Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia, the companies said. The transaction will increase Southern\u2019s earnings per share the first year after closing, Fanning said. AGL rose 28 percent to $61.41 in New York, the highest close in more than 30 years. Southern fell 4.9 percent to $43.58, down 11 percent this year. Electric utilities have reported slower growth in sales amid energy conservation as demand for gas has risen. Southern\u2019s power sales volumes have gained an average of 1.2 percent annually over the past five years, according to company data compiled by Bloomberg. Gas revenue at AGL climbed 37 percent since 2011, when it acquired Nicor Inc., another distributor. The acquisition would give Southern a 5 percent stake in the $5 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline under development by electric utility owners Dominion Resources Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. The line would deliver fuel from the largest U.S. gas field, the Marcellus shale, to eastern Virginia and North Carolina. AGL plans $5 billion in spending over the next five years, mostly to extend and improve local lines, Somerhalder said today on the analyst call. About $650 million is committed to pipeline expansion including the Atlantic Coast project, he said. Citigroup Inc. was Southern Co.\u2019s financial adviser. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised AGL. Legal advisers were Jones Day, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Troutman Sanders LLP for Southern and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP for AGL. Southern intends to sell $3 billion of new stock from this year through 2016 to finance the purchase, Chief Financial Officer Art Beattie said on the joint call. Debt to cover the cash purchase will be issued in the second or third quarters of 2016, shortly before closing, he said. The merger agreement includes a breakup fee of $201 million, according to a Monday filing.","timestamp":1440405570.0,"participant_ids":["GAS:US","SO:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-24\/southern-co-to-buy-gas-distributor-agl-resources-for-8-billion","subject":"Southern Co. to Buy AGL Resources for $8 Billion in Cash"},{"body":"The Federal Reserve has lit a fire under corporate borrowers who are again faced with the prospect of an interest-rate increase this year. Companies from\u00a0Microsoft Corp. to American Express Co. and Norfolk Southern Corp. rushed back to the bond market to lock in cheap borrowing costs before the central bank ends its unprecedented zero-rate era. Fed Chair Janet Yellen and policy makers signaled this week\u00a0they remain prepared to raise their key rate as soon as their next meeting starting Dec. 15, pushing the perceived odds of a rate increase to 50 percent. \"The message has been sent that if you have issuance planned, it might be a good idea to go now,\" said Hans Mikkelsen, head of U.S. investment-grade credit strategy at Bank of America Corp. in New York. \"You can\u2019t be sure what the market will look like when the Fed starts to raise rates.\" Corporate treasurers are finding a rare window after a tumultuous stretch that left debt investors with the worst losses in four years. After a decline of 2.8 percent for the previous six months, dollar-denominated bonds of companies from the most-creditworthy to the riskiest have gained 0.8 percent in October, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Microsoft led the way Thursday with its   of $13 billion. The seven-part deal eclipsed a mark set just eight months ago by the tech giant as it raises money to repurchase stock and repay existing debt. American Express raised $1 billion in a two-part deal, while Norfolk Southern issued $600 million of 30-year bonds, its second offering of such debt this year. The issuance is keeping 2015 on pace for a record year, with the 1.41 trillion in dollar-denominated debt sold poised to beat 2014\u2019s record of $1.57 trillion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \"An earlier rate rise than initially signaled is a strong incentive to issue sooner than later,\" said Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about $10 billion as head of multi-sector strategies at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.\u00a0\"There\u2019s been a lot of supply, and there will be more supply coming, there is no doubt about that.\" While Fed policy makers\u00a0on Oct. 28 kept the central bank\u2019s target rate near zero -- where it\u2019s been since 2008 -- they\u00a0added a reference to the possibility of increasing the rate \"at its next meeting\" based on \"realized and expected\" progress in reaching economic-growth goals. They maintained that the economy continues to expand at a \"moderate\" pace. U.S. junk bonds have returned 2.7 percent in October, on pace for the strongest month since 2012, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. Investment-grade issues gained 0.4 percent. The cost of borrowing relative to government debt has dropped to the lowest in more than a month, down from a more than three-year high at the start of the month, the index data show. That\u2019s setting up for a busy issuance calendar for the rest of the year, according to Barclays Plc. It isn\u2019t all smooth sailing for issuers. Microsoft had to pay a 0.18 percentage point premium on its $3 billion offering of 10-year notes, more than the yield on its similar maturity debt in the secondary market on Wednesday. Lannett Co. and its bank, Morgan Stanley, are   on a $1.2 billion loan deal to lure investors stung by drug-maker debt following a selloff in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter. High-yield energy debt, plagued by commodity-market woes, is trading at a yield of 11.86 percent after touching a 7.87 percent low for the year in May. For Bank of America\u2019s Mikkelsen, a December lift-off isn\u2019t a sure thing because the U.S. economy has yet to return to full strength. Data Thursday showed gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced in the U.S., rose at a 1.5 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, down from a 3.9 percent pace in the previous three months. Inflation also remains well below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent goal, with its preferred gauge of prices rising by just 0.3 percent in the 12 months through August. \"The Fed will be very data dependent, and it\u2019s clear the U.S. is losing some momentum, \" he said. Barclays\u2019s\u00a0Mark Bamford pointed to merger-and-acquisition activity at a  , along with the scarcity of alternatives to corporate-bond market, as reasons for issuance to continue at a record pace for the rest of the year. \"The supply demand dynamic still favors the market, and the atmosphere of low growth and low inflation is still good for bonds,\" said Bamford, the New York-based head of global fixed-income syndicate at Barclays.","timestamp":1446157338.0,"participant_ids":["BAC:US","MSFT:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-30\/fed-sparks-dash-for-cheap-debt-with-december-hike-back-on-table","subject":"Fed Sparks Dash for Cheap Debt With December Hike Back on Table"},{"body":"Duke Energy Corp. agreed to acquire Piedmont Natural Gas Co. for $4.9 billion in cash, adding a distributor of cheap shale gas as growth in power demand slows. Duke follows electric utility owners Southern Co., Emera Inc. and   which have acquired gas distributors in the past 12 months. The deal increases Duke\u2019s stake in the $5 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline to 50 percent. When completed, the line will link gas fields in West Virginia to Duke\u2019s service area in North Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s opening Duke\u2019s door into the gas infrastructure business,\u201d Shahriar Pourreza, a New York-based analyst for Guggenheim Securities LLC, said Monday in a phone interview. He rates Duke at buy, doesn\u2019t rate Piedmont and owns neither. \u201cUtilities are going through a period where organic growth is slowing down, so they have to grow through acquisitions. Everybody wants to be in the gas infrastructure business.\u201d Piedmont shareholders will receive $60 in cash for each share of Piedmont common stock, about a 40 percent premium to the Oct. 23, closing price, the companies said Monday in a statement. Duke will assume about $1.8 billion in Piedmont\u2019s net debt, representing an enterprise value of about $6.7 billion. Piedmont rose 37 percent to $57.82 in New York, the biggest daily gain and the highest price since at least 1980, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Duke dropped 2 percent to $72.25. The deal \u201cenhances\u201d Duke\u2019s forecast earnings per share growth rate of 4 percent to 6 percent, the company said. Piedmont\u2019s rate base and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and amortization have been rising annually at about 9 percent, Duke Chief Financial Officer Steven Young said on a conference call with analysts and investors. Predictable, state-regulated profit from Piedmont\u2019s fuel delivery will reduce Duke\u2019s reliance on its international segment, Pourreza said. \u201cThis combination provides us with a growing natural gas platform, benefiting our customers, communities and investors,\u201d Duke Chief Executive Officer Lynn Good said in Monday\u2019s statement. Duke anticipates expanding Piedmont\u2019s system to supply power plants as gas displaces coal as the leading generation source, Good said on the call. Piedmont distributes and sells natural gas in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, and through subsidiaries markets gas in Georgia. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company also distributes propane in several states. Duke, the largest U.S utility owner by market value, has 7.3 million electric customers in six states. The combined company will have three times as many gas customers as Duke. Piedmont will retain its name and operate as a unit of Duke Energy. Duke will add one member of Piedmont\u2019s board of directors to its board after the transaction is closed. Completion of the transaction is conditioned upon approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and Piedmont shareholder approval. The companies are targeting a closing by the end of 2016. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised Piedmont. Barclays Plc advised Duke and will provide a bridge loan to finance the purchase. Permanent financing will include as much as $750 million of equity, as well as debt and cash, according to the statement. Southern agreed to buy AGL Resources Inc. in August for about $7.9 billion in cash. Black Hills agreed to buy closely held SourceGas Holdings for $1.17 billion in July and Emera last month announced purchase of Teco Energy Inc., an owner of gas utilities in New Mexico and Florida, for $6.5 billion.

Prescriptions he wrote were routinely filled by a pharmacy partner of drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. called Philidor Rx Services, which dispensed brand-name drugs he wanted his patients to get,\u00a0even when they couldn\u2019t win their insurers\u2019 OK -- or if they didn\u2019t even have insurance. And he said the relationship was great for his staff, because Philidor took over some of the paperwork that bogs down the day-to-day operations of many doctor\u2019s offices. The convenience may have come at a steep cost to the health-care system by making it easier for doctors to get brand-name drugs into the hands of their patients instead of cheaper generics. Some specialty pharmacies like Philidor are now drawing attention for the lengths they go to fill prescriptions with brand-name drugs and then secure insurance reimbursement. On Wednesday, Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest U.S. manager of prescription drug benefits, said it had removed the mail-order pharmacy Linden Care LLC from its network after concluding it dispensed a large portion of its medications from Horizon Pharma Plc and didn\u2019t fulfill its contractual agreements. Express Scripts said it\u2019s evaluating other \u201ccaptive pharmacies\u201d that it said are mostly distributing Horizon drugs. Horizon said it has no exclusive arrangements with pharmacies, including Linden, and note that Express Scripts\u2019 own mail-order pharmacy unit competes with Linden. In a statement, Linden said Horizon is just one of its many customers. Philidor, meanwhile, is being shut down in the wake of questions raised about its ties to Valeant, whose shares have plummeted 68 percent since Aug. 11 amid questions from investors and lawmakers about its business model and pricing strategy. The specialty mail-order pharmacy used a variety of tactics to get Valeant\u2019s brand-name products covered by insurers even when cheaper generics were available, according to former employees who declined to be identified discussing the company\u2019s practices. That is \u201cnot a sustainable proposition,\u201d said Gregory Curfman, a cardiologist and editor-in-chief of Harvard Health Publications.\u00a0Because generic drugs save money for individual patients and the health-care system, \u201cit should be the exception when a prescription is not filled with a generic.\u201d Philidor\u2019s relationship with Valeant was especially close: The drugmaker had paid $100 million for the option to acquire the pharmacy at no additional cost within a decade. In their push to boost sales of Valeant drugs, Philidor workers sometimes changed codes on doctors\u2019 prescriptions to ensure they were filled with the brand name instead of the generic, according to the former employees. Philidor denies that allegation and has said it only filled prescriptions with drugs doctors and patients sought. Valeant wanted a pharmacy to process prescriptions before getting insurance coverage, putting the risk of not getting reimbursement on the company instead of the patient, Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson said on a conference call with investors Tuesday. The company terminated its relationship with Philidor once allegations surrounding its business practices emerged, he said. Valeant shares slid 5.4 percent to $74.61 at 10:21 a.m. Thursday.  Rietkerk, the dermatologist, said he was surprised and disappointed when he learned the allegations about Philidor\u2019s operations. \u201cIt helped the patients but hurt the overall system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives medicine a black eye.\" Specialty pharmacies have their roots in the 1970s, when they began delivering temperature-controlled drugs to treat cancer, HIV, infertility and hemophilia. The business grew as more drugs became available for patients to inject themselves and as insurers sought to manage expenses for patients with chronic conditions, according to a   from IMS Health. Manufacturers have increasingly relied on these pharmacies when it comes to fragile medicines that need special handling or have potentially dangerous side effects that require them to be taken under a management program. Pfizer Inc. uses specialty pharmacies for the lung cancer drug Xalkori, while Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s $1,000 a day hepatitis C medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni are both sold through that route. Endo International Plc will generate almost 10 percent of its U.S. sales this year through specialty pharmacies. Since they can often deliver medicine by mail and guarantee a low out-of-pocket cost, they\u2019ve been popular with consumers. \u201cThe specialty pharmacy is in effect the future of the pharmacy industry,\" Bill Ackman, one of Valeant\u2019s top investors, said on a conference call last month defending the company\u2019s practices. \"I mean, why isn\u2019t Amazon the biggest pharmacy in the country, right?\" In addition to managing drug benefits for employers and insurers, CVS Health Corp. and Express Scripts have mail-order pharmacy units. Those divisions dominate the $78 billion specialty pharmacy market, accounting for more than half of sales, according to Diplomat Pharmacy Inc., the nation\u2019s largest independent specialty pharmacy company. Others include a unit of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc.\u2019s OptumRx division, Avella Specialty Pharmacy, Axium Healthcare Pharmacy Inc. and Prime Therapeutics LLC. Most don\u2019t concentrate on filling prescriptions with a manufacturer\u2019s brand-name drugs, said Dan Steiber, a pharmacist and editor of Specialty Pharmacy Times. \u201cWhat a specialty pharmacy does is quite different than the workarounds in those scenarios.\u201d When they operate as intended, they can markedly improve the health of patients and curtail costs, said Jonathan Palmer, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Drugmakers sometimes distribute a product only through specialty pharmacies, and insurance plans may require their use for access to particularly expensive or complex drugs. \u201cWhere a specialty pharmacy is in place to drive growth for the manufacturer is where you get dubious business practices,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cBut generally speaking, that\u2019s the exception rather than the rule.\u201d Now that Philidor is winding down its operations, Rietkerk said he\u2019s anticipating more follow-up appointments when generic substitutes don\u2019t work and more steps to complete authorizations for insurers. \"I\u2019m disappointed,\" he said. \"You want the most effective medicines for patients, and a cost-effective process.\u201d","timestamp":1447315200.0,"participant_ids":["9771209Z:US","ESRX:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-12\/pharmacies-like-philidor-make-life-easy-for-doctors-at-a-price","subject":"Valeant's Favorite Pharmacy Made Life Easy for Doctors, at a Price"},{"body":"Google, the world\u2019s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, is the first customer to sign on with a North Carolina program that lets the company purchase clean power directly from local utilities.

It\u2019s starting with very small numbers. Toyota sold 34 of them last month\u00a0in California, the only state in the U.S. where it is currently available for sale or lease, and plans to deliver 100 this year at a price of $58,335. The car qualifies for a $5,000 rebate from the state of California and the coveted,  . Toyota argues that hydrogen-powered vehicles have a big advantage over battery-electric cars and are a better long-term solution to clean-air regulations. The trapezoid-shaped Mirai can go 312 miles (502 kilometers) on a full tank of hydrogen and takes three to five minutes to refuel, which is closer to what consumers experience with gasoline-powered cars. No plug-in electric car on the market can go that far on a single charge. The world\u2019s largest automaker is making about three Mirais each day at a plant in Toyota City, the company\u2019s headquarters city in Japan. It plans to produce 2,000 of the cars next year and 3,000 in 2017 before accelerating production even faster. \u201cOur goal is to produce 30,000 units annually by 2020,\u201d said Yoshikazu Tanaka, the Mirai\u2019s chief engineer, during a presentation in San Francisco. \u201cFurther cost reduction is necessary to make the technology affordable and accessible.\u201d Toyota isn\u2019t alone. Honda Motor Co. is working on a reboot of its  , and Seoul-based Hyundai Motor Co. started selling a hydrogen-powered Tucson SUV  . Neither sells battery-EV in the U.S. California is helping Toyota\u2019s hydrogen play in a big way. Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger started talking about a \u201chydrogen highway\u201d back in 2004. The state\u2019s ambitious   calls for at least 1.5 million hydrogen, electric and plug-in vehicles to be on the roads by 2025. To jump-start the infrastructure needed to support consumer adoption, the state is spending $200 million to build 100 hydrogen refueling stations, many of them clustered in Los Angeles and around the Bay Area. Toyota is introducing the Mirai very slowly. Only eight Toyota dealerships -- four in northern California and four in southern California -- are designated \u201claunch dealers.\u201d Owners must live near one of those dealerships and in proximity to a hydrogen fueling station. Consumers don\u2019t have a lot of options and can choose between four colors: blue, white, silver and black. The   Toyota is throwing in for initial owners are plentiful, including three years of complimentary fuel and roadside assistance, and seven days with a free rental car annually. \u201cWe\u2019re just now starting to deliver the first Mirais in California,\u201d said Toyota spokesman John Hanson. \u201cBut we believe that hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, more than battery electric vehicles, will become mainstream vehicles more quickly.\u201d Toyota executives visited San Francisco Friday to talk about the company\u2019s broader vision of mobility amid global trends like an aging society, population growth and an increased need for smaller cars. Toyota sees battery-electric vehicles filling a niche for short commutes, but thinks that fuel cell vehicles, or FCVs, have the greatest potential for long distance driving and for use in buses and trucks. Like electricity, hydrogen can be produced in several ways; most is made from natural gas. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity from the chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, with water vapor as the only exhaust product. A fuel cell vehicle is refueled instead of recharged. Fuel cells like the Mirai, which means \u201cfuture\u201d in Japanese, have been questioned by competitors. Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has been among the loudest, calling them \u201cfool cells\u201d and telling analysts last year that the technology is inefficient and that \u201csuccess is not one of the possible outcomes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m bewildered that Elon Musk is denying fuel cells,\u201d said Tanaka, who spoke through an interpreter during an interview in San Francisco. \u201cBut if Elon Musk says fuel cell technology is stupid, in a sense this is true: We are just at the beginning. It was just born and has huge potential.\u201d Toyota was an early partner with Tesla, investing $50 million in the Palo Alto, California-based company and cooperating on the RAV4EV, which produced roughly 2,500 vehicles. But Toyota is now firmly focused on fuel cells, and has invested in FirstElement Fuel Inc., a startup that is creating a hydrogen fueling network. The Japanese automaker has stopped making the RAV4 EV. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t \u2018Do we need fuel cells or plug-in vehicles?\u201d\u2019 said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer in the Clean Vehicles Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cWe need both.

The decision to cut off Linden Care LLC is part of Express Scripts\u2019 continuing examination of relationships between drugmakers and pharmacies, started after recent revelations about the close ties between Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and a mail-order pharmacy called Philidor Rx Services. Express Scripts is already evaluating several other pharmacies it said get a substantial portion of their business from dispensing Horizon drugs -- businesses it calls \"captive pharmacies.\" Linden Care was terminated mainly because it \"represented itself as a retail provider when they are almost exclusively mail-order,\" Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said in a statement. Overall, 40 percent of prescription claims from Linden Care that Express Scripts received this year were for Horizon drugs, he said. In a statement, closely held Linden said it\u2019s a licensed retail pharmacy in New York and has received credentials from Express Scripts several times to reflect that much of its business is mail-order. The pharmacy said Horizon is one of many of its customers. Horizon shares sank 20 percent to $17.99 at the close in New York. The company denied that Linden or any other pharmacy is anything less than independent and accused Express Scripts of a conflict of interest, since the benefits manager operates one of the nation\u2019s largest mail-order pharmacies. Horizon has no ownership stake in any pharmacy, unlike Valeant\u2019s controversial option to acquire Philidor. \"The notion that Linden Care is a so-called \u2018captive pharmacy\u2019 of Horizon Pharma is entirely false,\" the drugmaker said in a statement. Linden Care, based in Woodbury, New York, filed a complaint Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Albany, New York, seeking a reversal of Express Scripts\u2019 decision. The complaint says Linden Care didn\u2019t violate its contract and that Express Scripts forced Linden out of its network on a \"trumped-up charge.\" The pharmacy benefit manager has known for years that Linden Care has been dispensing prescriptions out of state, and didn\u2019t object until now, the pharmacy said in its complaint. Art Kersey, Linden Care\u2019s chief compliance officer, declined to comment. The pharmacy has been majority owned since 2013 by BelHealth Investment Partners, according to the website of the New York-based private equity firm. Inder Tallur, a managing director at the firm, didn\u2019t immediately reply to a phone message Wednesday. Specialty pharmacies like Linden Care have come under the spotlight in the U.S. and drawn attention to the complex relationships between insurers, manufacturers and sellers. Some doctors, seeking to reduce insurance paperwork and ensure their orders were fulfilled as desired, had encouraged patients to contact Philidor to fill prescriptions for Valeant dermatology medicines like Jublia and Solodyn. Valeant announced plans to end its relationship with Philidor after the pharmacy\u2019s business practices came under scrutiny. Former Philidor employees have alleged that the pharmacy altered some doctors\u2019 orders to specify that they wanted brand-name drugs instead of generics, a way to get larger reimbursements for Valeant from health insurers. Philidor said that it only filled prescriptions with medications that doctors and patients requested. Weeks before Valeant said it would cut ties with Philidor, the drugmaker was planning to expand the relationship, Bloomberg has reported. Express Scripts and the two other largest U.S. drug-benefit managers announced last month that they would terminate Philidor from their networks. Express Scripts said at the time that it would review and evaluate \u201call similar captive pharmacy arrangements,\u201d referring to pharmacies that derive the vast majority of their prescription volume from one manufacturer or one product. In a Nov. 9 letter to Linden, Express Scripts said it had recently discovered that the pharmacy was mail-order and shouldn\u2019t have been part of the benefits manager\u2019s retail network. Express Scripts said Linden was also billing it for mailing drugs to Maryland and California without having a current license. The letter made no mention of Horizon. Linden Care, in its lawsuit, says it is licensed in Maryland. Horizon and Express Scripts have a history of bad blood. The drugmaker disclosed last year that Express Scripts and another benefits manager, CVS Health Corp., had dropped coverage of Horizon\u2019s two best-selling medications, stomach drugs Duexis and Vimovo. The benefits manager also said late Tuesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Horizon seeking $140 million, saying the drugmaker \u201crefused to honor certain contractual obligations\u201d under a rebate agreement. Express Scripts said in a statement that it\u2019s seeking \u201cto recover money rightfully due its clients.\u201d The lawsuit relates entirely to a previously disclosed dispute concerning a prior rebate agreement between the parties, Horizon said, adding that it is still reviewing the allegations in the complaint but the claims are without merit and it intends to defend itself. The drugmaker noted that Express Scripts has its own mail-order pharmacy unit, Accredo, that competes with businesses like Linden Care and accounts for a larger portion of Horizon\u2019s revenue than Linden Care does. Horizon said it\u2019s re-evaluating the relationship with Accredo. Horizon\u2019s relationship with specialty pharmacies is non-exclusive and each outlet may also fulfill prescriptions for other drug manufacturers, it said in the statement. Less than 5 percent of Horizon\u2019s net sales are from prescriptions that are filled by Linden Care and processed by Express Scripts, the drugmaker said. Before Wednesday\u2019s slump, Horizon shares had been paring losses recently after tumbling from $38.45 in July amid scrutiny of its use of specialty pharmacies. The company\u2019s hostile bid for fellow drugmaker Depomed Inc. has also met resistance from executives of the target company.","timestamp":1447202502.0,"participant_ids":["ESRX:US","9771209Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-11\/express-scripts-drops-linden-pharmacy-from-network-sues-horizon","subject":"Express Scripts Drops Pharmacy With Ties to Horizon Pharma"},{"body":" After igniting a price war over hepatitis C medicine that has roiled the pharmaceutical industry, Express Scripts Holding Co. is looking to reap savings from expensive new treatments for cancer and high cholesterol. A highly anticipated set of medications that aggressively reduce cholesterol, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, will be the next big opportunity to pit drugmakers against each other to reduce costs, Chief Executive Officer George Paz told investors today. That represents a threat to the revenue of companies like Amgen Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that are developing the drugs. Drugmaker stocks sank lower today on Paz\u2019s comments. Just as hepatitis C treatments by Gilead Sciences Inc. and AbbVie Inc. were approved by regulators within a span of weeks last year, the cholesterol drugs are likely to debut about the same time, Paz said. That would give an advantage to Express Scripts, which negotiate prices on behalf of insurers and corporations.

Gilead has fought back by winning its own exclusive deals with CVS Health Corp. and Anthem Inc. Yesterday Prime Therapeutics LLC, which manages medicine for non-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, said it   negotiating an exclusive discount with either company because prices for both drugs had fallen so much below their list prices -- $94,500 for a full course of Gilead\u2019s treatment and $83,319 for AbbVie\u2019s. Gilead slumped 4.2 percent to $96.99 at 2:39 p.m. in New York. The shares are down 11 percent since Dec. 19, when AbbVie   it would sell its hepatitis C drug at a discount. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for our moves, we wouldn\u2019t be realizing the savings that will come to all of our competitors,\u201d Paz said at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. It\u2019s premature to speculate on prices, Cuyler Mayer, an Amgen spokesman, said in an e-mail. Alexandra Bowie, a spokeswoman for Regeneron, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing payer activism for the first time,\u201d said Tim Mayleben, CEO of Esperion Therapeutics Inc., which is working on a competing cholesterol medication. \u201cIt\u2019s changing all the dynamics.\u201d Mayleben said Esperion\u2019s drug will be priced in between PCSK9s and cheaper generics, helping insulate it from Express Scripts\u2019 move. The company\u2019s treatment is more attractive for some patients because it\u2019s taken orally, while PCSK9s are injected, he said in an interview. Cancer Next? Express Scripts, the biggest of the drug-benefits managers, is also looking further ahead to high-priced medicine for cancer after it tackles the cholesterol market. \u201cThat\u2019s the short-term, and cancer is the long-term,\u201d Paz said. Amgen\u2019s leukemia drug Blincyto will cost $178,000 for a standard course of treatment, the company said last month. Merck & Co. plans to charge about $150,000 a year for cancer drug Keytruda. Shares of Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, California, and Regeneron, based in Tarrytown, New York, slipped after Paz\u2019s comments. Amgen fell less than 1 percent to $154.93, down from a 3 percent gain earlier in the day. Regeneron slid 1.2 percent after having traded as much as 2.9 percent higher. The S&P 500 Pharmaceutical Index fell 0.9 percent.

Really. While most states have been pushing health insurers to curb proposed price increases, Florida is telling some of them they can charge more. The state on Wednesday approved an average premium increase of 9.5 percent for Affordable Care Act plans sold to individuals for next year. Insurers had asked to boost rates 8.6 percent on average. Humana Inc. and Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida were among those whose final rates were higher than they\u2019d first sought. Alex Kepnes, a Humana spokesman, said the approved increase incorporated updated information from the U.S. government on ACA programs designed to spread cost, known as reinsurance and risk adjustments. Kepnes said it\u2019s routine for rates to be adjusted between initial submission and final approval. Calls to a BCBS media line weren\u2019t answered. Regulators can push insurers to raise rates if they think companies aren\u2019t charging enough to cover costs, which could raise the prospect of a company failing. They also have the power in some states to force insurers to lower rates. \u201cIn most cases, when a state changes a rate in the rate review process, it\u2019s to lower it, not to increase it,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, who studies private health plans at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Humana had asked to raise rates 7.4 percent in one set of plans it\u2019s selling in Florida. Instead, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation told it to boost rates 16.3 percent. For the Blue Cross & Blue Shield plan, the final rate increase was 8.9 percent, more than double the 4.3 percent request. The rate increases were determined by a review that included risk adjustment amounts and other factors, Amy Bogner, a spokeswoman for the Florida regulator, said by e-mail. Florida also held down rate requests for some insurers. Aetna\u2019s premium increase was limited to 13.9 percent, down from a requested 21 percent. Humana, which is being acquired by Aetna Inc., has faced higher-than-expected costs in some policies it sold under Obamacare. In Georgia, for instance, the company said its customers were sicker than expected, and it had to cover more out-of-network doctor visits than it planned for. The insurer ran into that problem in Florida as well, and told regulators it expects more customers to stay in network next year. The rates are averages, weighted by 2015 enrollment, and don\u2019t take into account subsidies that individuals with low incomes get to buy coverage.\u00a0More than 93 percent of enrollees in Florida are getting those subsidies this year, receiving $294 a month on average. Rates can vary by age and geographic area. Florida isn\u2019t the only state that made insurers raise their charges. In Oregon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan asked to cut rates by 2 percent and ended up increasing premiums by 8.3 percent on average.","timestamp":1440655200.0,"participant_ids":["HUM:US","HUM:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-27\/florida-regulators-tell-humana-to-raise-obamacare-plan-rates","subject":"Florida Regulators Tell Humana to Raise Obamacare Plan Rates"},{"body":" CVS Health Corp. Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo is betting billions that nursing-home pharmacy operator Omnicare Inc. can further his efforts to transform the drugstore chain into a dominant health-care player. Under Merlo, who took the helm in 2011, CVS stopped the sale of cigarettes, saying it was contrary to the mission of improving customers\u2019 health, and changed its name to CVS Health from CVS Caremark. He has aggressively expanded CVS\u2019s in-store health clinics, with plans to add about 600 locations by 2017, and in 2013 purchased an operator of drug-infusion centers. The agreement to buy Omnicare, valued by CVS at $12.7 billion including debt, may be Merlo\u2019s most significant move yet for profits. CVS said it will add adjusted earnings of 20 cents a share next year. The all-cash deal is the drug-retailing leader\u2019s biggest since 2007 when it paid $21.7 billion for pharmacy benefit manager Caremark Rx Inc., an acquisition made under Merlo\u2019s predecessor that began the company\u2019s diversification. CVS is \u201cmoving away from being solely a pharmacy and PBM to becoming more of a vertical integrator of health care,\u201d said Jonathan Palmer, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. It\u2019s a strategy tuned to an aging population with greater care needs, and broader consolidation in the industry, Palmer said. Merlo, 59, comes from a health-care background. He was trained as a pharmacist at the University of Pittsburgh and started at Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS in 1990 when it acquired Peoples Drug. Before taking over as CEO he led the company\u2019s pharmacy retail division. He\u2019s been lauded for banishing cigarettes, getting invited by First Lady Michelle Obama to her husband\u2019s State of the Union address this year and being named one of Fortune Magazine\u2019s business people of the year. CVS declined to make him available for an interview. \u201cWe see ourselves at the forefront of the changing health-care landscape,\u201d Merlo said Wednesday at the UBS Global Health Care Conference. Omnicare delivers drugs and helps senior-living facilities manage residents\u2019 medications. Under the deal, CVS will pay $98 per share in cash. CVS\u2019s $12.7 billion valuation for Omnicare includes $2.3 billion in debt. Merlo said in a conference call with analysts that he hopes Omnicare will be a \u201cgreat platform\u201d as it looks to move deeper into the long-term care and assisted-living sectors. CVS\u2019s pharmacy services unit, whose revenues expanded by 18.2 percent in the first quarter, is driving the company\u2019s growth. Retailing grew by only 2.9 percent in the period. Demand for pharmacy services has been on the rise as patients, insurers and employers look to manage their costs amid soaring drug prices. With more control over different aspects of the drug-supply chain, companies can get more leverage on price. CVS is the biggest U.S. retailer of prescription drugs and the second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, handling plans for health insurers and employers.

The Food and Drug Administration limited sales of Repatha to people with hard-to-treat levels of bad cholesterol, according to a   from the agency. The injection will cost $14,100 a year, Amgen said,\u00a0and will be available in the U.S. next week. Repatha belongs to a category of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors designed to help patients with ultra-high bad, or LDL, cholesterol who can\u2019t get their condition under control with widely used statins such as Pfizer Inc.\u2019s Lipitor.\u00a0Sanofi and\u00a0Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. won approval on July 24 for their PCSK9 drug, Praluent. Repatha was approved in the European Union on July 21 for patients with uncontrolled cholesterol who require additional intensive reduction of LDL cholesterol. Express Scripts Holding Co., the U.S.\u2019s largest manager of prescription drug benefits, said PCSK9s could be the most expensive therapies ever seen, costing as much as $100 billion a year \u201cif not managed properly.\u201d As many as 10 million Americans may have conditions that would make them eligible for the drugs. The pharmacy manager said Thursday that it would make a decision on how to cover the new drugs in the next several weeks. It didn\u2019t rule out excluding either Amgen\u2019s or Sanofi and Regeneron\u2019s treatment to force price concessions. In the meantime, it will cover both. \u201cOur preference would be that both Amgen and Sanofi\/Regeneron provide our clients favorable pricing so that it would make sense for our national formulary to cover both products,\u201d David Whitrap, an Express Scripts spokesman, said in an e-mail. CVS Health Corp., the second-largest pharmacy benefit manager after Express Scripts, said it would also review both new drugs and try to negotiate favorable pricing. \u201cAmgen is sensitive to the concerns of payers around cost, budget predictability and paying for value,\u201d said Anthony Hooper, Amgen\u2019s vice president of global commercial operations. Amgen will work with health insurers and pharmacy managers on getting the drugs covered, and finding ways to charge based on how effective they are. Sanofi and Regeneron\u2019s Praluent is given every two weeks in either a 75-milligram or 150-milligram injection, each of which costs $560 per shot, or almost $15,000 a year. Amgen\u2019s will have a list price of $542.31 per shot. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Education estimates the annual PCSK9 cost to Medicare will be  , assistant secretary Richard Frank said in a presentation. UnitedHealth Group Inc., the largest health insurer in the U.S., will require patients who want to start taking Praluent to already use a high-intensity statin such as AstraZeneca Plc\u2019s Crestor or, if they can\u2019t tolerate strong statins, a low- or moderate-intensity one such as Merck & Co.\u2019s Zocor. Aetna Inc. put Praluent on a   that requires patients first fail to get their cholesterol under control with two high-dose statins. The insurer also requires Praluent be used in combination with a statin at the maximum tolerated dose.

The agreement specified that holders of Genzyme stock receive rights to $3.8 billion in payments if the drug reached certain milestones, including approval from the the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by March 31, 2014, according to the trustee. \"Sanofi took those potential milestone payments into account in evaluating Lemtrada\u2019s profitability, embarked on a slow path to FDA approval and departed from its own drug commercialization patterns and those of others in the industry,\" the trustee claimed in Monday\u2019s complaint. \"As a result, Sanofi missed the contractual milestones and skirted its payment obligations of at least $708 million.\" Sanofi acquired Genzyme for about $20 billion in 2011. Lemtrada had sales of $174.4 million in sales in the first nine months of this year, Sanofi said in a regulatory filing. Mary Kathryn Steel, a Sanofi spokeswoman, declined comment on the suit.

About 100 jobs will be eliminated at the company in North America, Elias Zerhouni, head of R&D at Paris-based Sanofi, said in a phone interview. Tal Zaks, who has led the oncology unit since last year, will leave, people with knowledge of the matter said. Zaks, 49, declined to comment on his plans. Sanofi is making the changes, an acknowledgment that the cancer business didn\u2019t meet expectations, with Chairman Serge Weinberg at the helm following the October ouster of Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher. The company is preparing to introduce as many as six products this year. The changes are \u201cadjustments according to the fortunes or misfortunes of particular programs,\u201d Zerhouni said. The new CEO will inherit a company that has, over the past five years, done a \u201chuge amount of restructuring, everywhere around the world, including France.\u201d Shares of Sanofi climbed 14 percent since Oct. 28, the day before the CEO\u2019s ouster, matching the advance in the Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical Index. The drugmaker will stop operating oncology as a separate division. It will move cancer research into global R&D operations, a person with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified as the plans aren\u2019t yet public. Genzyme will concentrate on rare diseases and neuro-immunology disorders, the person said. The changes were to be presented today to employees. The drugmaker will eliminate some jobs while hiring in areas that are a priority, Zerhouni said. The cancer unit had been \u201cthe hope and aspiration of a renewal of the oncology business line\u201d when it was formed in 2009, Zerhouni said. \u201cBy 2015, our core business has not increased. Why would you incur a huge infrastructure cost that is inherent to a division with a business that is not strong enough to do that?\u201d The unit, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was created shortly after Viehbacher took the helm. Sanofi purchased BiPar Sciences Inc. the same year, gaining access to the experimental cancer treatment iniparib, which the former CEO touted as important to Sanofi\u2019s transformation. The drug failed a key trial in 2011. The introduction of Jevtana therapy in the U.S. in 2010 also disappointed, two people said. Sanofi also lost patent protection for Taxotere and Eloxatin. In oncology, the drugmaker will \u201cstep back a little bit, reinvest in R&D, focus on things that are more promising, and just catch the next wave,\u201d Zerhouni said. One treatment with great potential is an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody to treat multiple myeloma that\u2019s in mid-stage development, he said. Sanofi will also consider acquisitions in oncology, looking well into the future, Zerhouni said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s off-limits,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a pretty comfortable position because I have a pretty full late-stage portfolio all the way to 2017-2018.\u201d The changes to the company, building upon alterations made by Viehbacher, have been planned over almost nine months, Zerhouni said. Sanofi said in November that by 2020 it plans to introduce 18 new products that could garner cumulative sales of 30 billion euros ($34 billion) over the first five years. Total revenue was 33.8 billion euros last year. The 100 jobs represent about 2 percent of Sanofi\u2019s workforce in Massachusetts. The drugmaker has a global total of more than 100,000 employees. Going forward, Sanofi\u2019s oncology research will be led by Vicky Richon, who will report to Chief Scientific Officer Gary Nabel, one of the people said. Oncology activities, including cancer research, will be based in Cambridge and Vitry, near Paris. Jevtana and other cancer medicines will be folded into Sanofi\u2019s global marketing organization, led by Pascale Witz, two people said. Matthew Ros will lead the oncology commercial operations, one of the people said. Sanofi purchased Genzyme Corp., the largest maker of treatments for rare genetic diseases, in 2011. Last year, the French company accessed additional experimental drugs for rare diseases by buying a stake in Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. At Genzyme, Sanofi plans to build on success with multiple sclerosis treatments and \u201cadjust resources so that we can do more of the rare-disease programs,\u201d Zerhouni said. \u201cThe Alnylam relationship is a good one and we have programs that are entering stage three faster than I thought,\u201d he said, referring to late-stage drug trials. The Sanofi-Genzyme R&D center, which was led by Richard Gregory until December, is now overseen by Jim Burns, who is also head of Sanofi\u2019s R&D hub in Massachusetts, one person said. The drugmaker has had some high-profile departures since Viehbacher\u2019s ouster, including  , who was senior vice president for research and translational medicine, and Paul Sekhri, who ran integrated care. Still, the company is retaining talent and attracting top researchers, Zerhouni said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t leave an R&D organization when they see the portfolio that we have,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1423664312.0,"participant_ids":["SAN:FP","GENZ:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-11\/sanofi-to-shrink-cancer-operations-narrow-focus-of-genzyme-r-d","subject":"Sanofi to Shrink Cancer Operations, Narrow Focus of Genzyme R&D"},{"body":" There\u2019s never been a better time for Pharmacyclics Inc. to consider a sale. The developer of cancer treatments was trading at a record even before surging as much as 23 percent Wednesday after people familiar with the matter   it\u2019s exploring a sale and has attracted Johnson & Johnson and Novartis AG. A takeover premium would give a final boost to a stock that\u2019s already gained more than sevenfold in the past three years on the strength of its blockbuster cancer drug Imbruvica. The dizzying rise in the shares led Roth Capital Partners\u2019 Joseph Pantginis to say last week that the good news on the drug may already be baked into the price. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t argue with the team cashing out at a premium to this stock price,\u201d Brian Skorney, a New York-based analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a phone interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve demonstrated that it\u2019s a fantastic drug.\u201d Companies with promising treatments in hand are finding ready buyers as large drugmakers seek to replace once-blockbuster remedies that are now facing patent expirations. There have already been $42 billion of acquisitions announced so far in 2015 among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and health-care products companies, after a record year for deals in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pharmacyclics shares climbed 17 percent on Wednesday to $220.22, valuing the drug developer at $16.7 billion. It may fetch $17 billion to $18 billion in a sale, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. That would make it the biggest biotechnology deal since 2011, when Sanofi completed its purchase of Genzyme Corp. for about $20 billion. The long-term prospects for Imbruvica might make a takeover worth the price. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration this year approved a fourth use for the cancer-fighting treatment, which should help push Pharmacyclics\u2019 revenue to more than $2.5 billion by 2017, according to analysts\u2019 estimates. \u201cImbruvica is a once-in-a-decade, or every couple of decades, drug,\u201d Baird\u2019s Skorney said. J&J\u2019s Janssen Biotech Inc. is already partnered with Pharmacyclics on Imbruvica and that makes it the most logical acquirer, Skorney said. A takeover of Pharmacyclics would be J&J\u2019s biggest deal since 2012, when it bought Synthes Inc., a maker of devices to treat bone fractures and trauma. It largely sat out of last year\u2019s merger boom, opting instead to sell about $4 billion in assets. The company is seeking to restock its pipeline as drugs such as hepatitis C treatment Olysio and blood thinner Xarelto face new competition. Analysts project the company\u2019s revenue will decline 3.5 percent this year, its worst performance in more than three decades. Skorney estimates Pharmacyclics could fetch as much as $275 a share in a takeover, a premium of about 25 percent on top of Wednesday\u2019s gains.","timestamp":1424886741.0,"participant_ids":["PCYC:US","JNJ:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-25\/high-flier-pharmacyclics-picks-right-time-for-sale-real-m-a","subject":"High-Flier Pharmacyclics Picks Right Time for Sale"},{"body":" When South Korean venture capitalist Park Young Ho first visited Kakao Corp., its founders said they didn\u2019t need any money, at least not yet. It was March 2011 and Park admired the company\u2019s messaging app, which was close to passing 10 million users after its roll out 12 months earlier. \u201cI was convinced about its growth momentum,\u201d said Park, the 36-year-old senior principal at Korea Investment Partners Co., the nation\u2019s biggest venture capital firm. \u201cGiven Korea\u2019s population of 49 million, I thought \u2018Game over, Kakao\u2019s won.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to miss out so I stayed continuously in contact with the company and after five months, the deal was closed.\u201d Park\u2019s persistence paid off. Korea Investment Partners injected 5 billion won ($4.5 million) at about 10,000 won a share. Today, shares of the operator of South Korea\u2019s largest mobile messaging service, with 167 million subscribers globally, are 20 times that after it merged with Seoul-listed Daum Communications Corp. in October. In Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy, where neon-lit cosmetics stores and glittering skyscrapers mingle with K-pop and kimchi, venture capital is fast becoming big business. About 13.2 trillion won was committed to early stage funding as of Nov. 30, a record, as President Park Geun Hye seeks to promote small business and innovation while wresting Korean commerce from the grip of its giant family-run Chaebol conglomerates. \u201cVenture capital can be a catalyst for creating new jobs and adding value as a country\u2019s potential for economic growth decreases with an aging population and low birthrate,\u201d said Chah Eun Young, an economics professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. \u201cIt\u2019s playing a vital role in building infrastructure for creative new businesses, and it\u2019s increasing opportunities for women, who in Korea have a low economic participation rate despite so many having higher degrees.\u201d Venture capital funds invested in Korea totaled 1.4 trillion won during the first 11 months of 2014, a 14.6 percent increase from the same period of 2013, according to data from the Korean Venture Capital Association. Information technology manufacturing and services businesses received the biggest share, at 22.8 percent, followed by biotechnology and medical and cultural enterprises. Early-stage investment, for startups less than three years old, accounted for 31.5 percent of outlays. Korea\u2019s government, faced with the world\u2019s most rapidly aging society -- average life expectancy is forecast to be   by the end of the century -- is trying to develop a \u2018creative economy\u2019 via nurturing startups in order to overcome sluggish economic growth and a shortage of jobs for young people and women. The government budget for supporting companies in their infancy was about 2.17 trillion won last year and 2.25 trillion won in 2013, according to a report from National Assembly Budget Office released Nov. 10. That\u2019s up from 1.81 trillion won in 2011 and 1.98 trillion won in 2012. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that small and mid-sized companies are the growth engines of Korea\u2019s economy and are essential to reviving it,\u201d said Park Jin Taek, a director-general of policy development at the Korean Venture Capital Association. \u201cFacebook and Twitter were also venture capital-backed startups once.\u201d The country has the manufacturing and financial infrastructure to support innovation, KVCA\u2019s Park said. It\u2019s home to consumer electronics and technology giants Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc., and narrowly missed out attaining developed market status for its capital markets last year. South Korea is also streets ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to high-tech, boasting the highest broadband penetration rate outside of Western Europe,   show. The return on investment for venture capital exits increased to 8.72 percent in 2013, versus 4.06 percent in 2012 and 2.54 percent in 2011, data from the KVCA show. The yield on 10-year government bonds has fallen from 3.63 percent at the start of 2014 to 2.55 percent as the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rates twice last year to bolster demand and price gains. Venture capital funds in Korea typically invest for about seven years before exiting, according to Korea Investment Partners\u2019 Park. Depressed bond yields are drawing pension funds to venture capital investments as they seek higher returns, KVCA\u2019s Park said. Of the 1.6 trillion won of venture capital funds raised last year as of Sept. 30, pension funds accounted for 30.9 percent, followed by policy funds at 18.1 percent and venture capital firms themselves at 12.3 percent. The aim is to find the \u201cnext Kakao,\u201d Korea Investment Partners\u2019 Park said. The company, whose KakaoTalk instant messaging service is on about 93 percent of smartphones in South Korea, was valued at about $3 billion in May when a reverse merger with Daum Communications was first mooted in the biggest coming together of Internet companies in the country\u2019s history. The combined group\u2019s market value is now about 8.4 trillion won. \u201cSuch a company comes along about once in a decade,\u201d Park said, pointing to the previous success of search-engine operator Naver Corp., which listed in 2002 and now owns Line Corp., Japan\u2019s most-popular messaging service. \u201cThe Kakao success story became possible because there was a paradigm shift from PC Internet to mobile at the time. The government\u2019s promotion does have an effect. It looks similar to that of former President Kim Dae Jung\u2019s administration in 1998.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Korea has turned to startups to reinvigorate a flagging economy.

With family patriarch Lee Kun Hee recuperating from a heart attack a year ago, his only son is restructuring family holdings, making acquisitions and meeting leaders from China\u2019s Xi Jinping to Apple Inc.\u2019s Tim Cook. The group\u2019s jewel, Samsung Electronics Co., introduced Galaxy S6 smartphones to plaudits and committed $15 billion to build a semiconductor plant in South Korea. The younger Lee, 46, has taken on responsibility for steering the nation\u2019s largest chaebol of about 70 companies even as cultural norms keep him from being named chairman while his father is alive. The group has said little about succession, with top executives remaining in charge of their businesses while the chairman is hospitalized, yet his son is taking on a broader role and providing long-term vision. \u201cIt looks like Lee Jae Yong is trying to deliver a message that his Samsung is different from that of his father\u2019s,\u201d Lee Sang Hun, a Seoul-based analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co., said. \u201cLee Jae Yong is not the chairman of Samsung in principle, but we all know that he is in practice.\u201d Samsung\u2019s approach is unusual by the standards outside Korea. Most companies in the U.S., for instance, typically make it clear to investors immediately who is taking over when a top executive leaves or is incapacitated, and those that are not forthcoming come under pressure for more information. When Steve Jobs suffered a sharp decline in weight in 2008, his gaunt appearance fueled speculation he was sick as analysts and media pressed for an explanation. Even though Cook had filled in on numerous occasions, the company released little information. By 2011, the company was more open with public statements discussing Jobs\u2019 medical leave, Cook\u2019s appointment as interim CEO and later his formal succession. Yet Samsung remains tight-lipped. The group hasn\u2019t detailed how Lee Kun Hee\u2019s power will be transferred and didn\u2019t make any public announcement after his   until the media started asking questions. \u201cThe intricacies of succession in the chaebol are unique to South Korea,\u201d said  , a Paris-based analyst at Forrester Research Inc. \u201cU.S. firms would probably be under more financial pressure to act on a succession plan.\u201d Shares of Samsung Electronics fell 1 percent to 1,352,000 won in Seoul. The stock has risen 1.3 percent since Lee Kun Hee\u2019s heart attack, compared with an 8.5 percent rise in the benchmark Kospi index. In South Korea, it would be tantamount to revolution at family-run business groups for the son to take the chairman\u2019s title from his ailing father, said Kim Sang Jo, a professor of economics at Hansung University in Seoul. \u201cThe chairman\u2019s title will never be handed over to Lee Jae Yong until Lee Kun Hee is deceased,\u201d said Kim. \u201cThat is a very unique chaebol culture of Korea.\u201d That means the man also known as Jay Y. is conducting an extended audition for leadership at Samsung Group, where companies in the technology, insurance, construction and fashion industries each have their own management. The electronics business that generates the most revenue has three co-CEOs, all appointed by the elder Lee. \u201cInvestors are looking at Samsung\u2019s business and the succession plan as separate issues,\u201d said Kim Hyun Su, a fund manager at IBK Asset Management Co. in Seoul. \u201cAs long as no big problems are spotted on the business side, it doesn\u2019t seem investors will complain much about the lack of communication about succession.\u201d In addition to Cook and Chinese President Xi, the younger Lee met with Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the past year. Jay Y. has been groomed as the potential leader since he joined the chaebol full time in 2001. He has an undergraduate degree from Seoul National University, the nation\u2019s top school, and a master\u2019s from Japan\u2019s Keio University. He also studied for a Ph.D. at Harvard Business School, though he didn\u2019t receive a degree. With most daily operations left to incumbent executives, Jay Y. has focused on setting the strategic direction of Samsung Group and trimming the sprawling empire. That includes holding initial public offerings for two family companies to prepare for potential inheritance taxes and keep the family\u2019s grip on the group, while also   of stakes in chemicals and defense units. That has helped the group focus on reviving its biggest business of electronics and moving beyond its emphasis on manufacturing. \u201cVice Chairman Jay Y. Lee has for a number of years been providing leadership focusing on overall business performance, driving major innovation and long-term strategy,\u201d Samsung Group said in an e-mailed statement. Since Lee Kun Hee\u2019s heart attack, Samsung Electronics has participated in 12 acquisitions and ventures, twice as many as the previous 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Deals under Jay Y.\u2019s watch include buying   to open a new front against Apple through payments systems and purchasing  , which makes mobile applications to control electronics in houses. Jay Y.\u2019s only formal steps so far toward succeeding his father are plans to   Lee Kun Hee at two Samsung charitable foundations this month. While the Lee family has unchallenged control of Samsung Group through a web of shareholdings, Jay Y.\u2019s past 12 months haven\u2019t been without scrutiny. Doubts about his abilities were heightened by the slump in earnings at Samsung Electronics as the company lost smartphone market share to Apple and Chinese rivals led by Xiaomi Corp. \u201cIt\u2019s tough timing and a big burden for him to lead the company,\u201d said Chung Sun Sup, CEO of corporate researcher Chaebul.com. \u201cHe needs to draw and propose a long-term master plan of his vision for Samsung.\u201d During Jay Y.\u2019s tenure, Samsung Electronics has fought back with new Galaxy S6 devices, announced the new chip plant investment and positioned itself to capitalize on the move to connected devices, the so-called Internet of Things. Analysts now expect the company\u2019s first profit rise in five quarters, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cSamsung Electronics\u2019 second-quarter results will be a lot better, and that will surely help make his one-year leadership look fairly pretty,\u201d said Lee at HI Investment & Securities Co. With South Korean custom emphasizing deference to family elders, the heir to Samsung is expected to keep his focus on running the empire in Lee Kun Hee\u2019s absence, even with an interim tag on his job description. \u201cForeigners will have no idea why Samsung\u2019s not naming the next chairman, but it\u2019s a very unique and Korean thing,\u201d said Chang Sea Jin, author of \u201cSony vs. Samsung: The Inside Story of the Electronics Giants\u2019 Battle For Global Supremacy.\u201d \u201cSamsung\u2019s emperor is now in the hospital and his son, the crown prince, must remain at his post until his father\u2019s dynasty ends with his death.\u201d","timestamp":1432144800.0,"participant_ids":["005930:KS","SNUNIZ:KS","AAPL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-20\/samsung-heir-who-can-t-take-chairman-s-title-reshapes-chaebol","subject":"Samsung Heir Who Can\u2019t Take Chairman Title Reshapes Chaebol"},{"body":" Olivier Brandicourt, who runs Bayer AG\u2019s health-care business, is a frontrunner to become chief executive officer of Sanofi as France\u2019s biggest drugmaker moves toward appointing a new leader by March, people with knowledge of the company\u2019s strategy said. Talks for Brandicourt to leave his current role are under way and largely dependent on unwinding contractual obligations at Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer, said the people, asking not to be identified as the negotiations are private. The companies may fail to reach an agreement, and other candidates are also under consideration, they said. Brandicourt would be taking the helm at a company that has said the sales growth at its key diabetes division will be tepid through 2018. The Paris-based drugmaker fired its former chief Chris Viehbacher, 54, on Oct. 29, a day after he surprised investors by forecasting flat sales this year for its best-selling Lantus insulin. Jack Cox, a Sanofi spokesman, and Oliver Renner, a spokesman for Bayer, declined to comment. Brandicourt, who turns 59 today, didn\u2019t immediately reply to an e-mail seeking comment. Shares of Sanofi rose 1.6 percent to 86.30 euros as of 2:53 p.m. today. They have gained 21 percent since Viehbacher\u2019s ouster, compared with a 16 percent climb in the Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical Index. Brandicourt, a doctor trained in Paris, has been CEO of Bayer\u2019s health-care business since 2013, after rising through the ranks at Pfizer Inc. to lead the U.S. company\u2019s emerging markets and established products units. Earlier in his career, he was a malaria researcher in Paris and spent two years working as a doctor in the Republic of Congo. Weinberg, 64, has been actively leading Sanofi since Viehbacher\u2019s ouster, and is working closely with the other members of Sanofi\u2019s executive committee, two people said. The chairman said Feb. 5 that Sanofi expects to appoint a new CEO this quarter. Following Viehbacher\u2019s departure, Weinberg said Sanofi would look outside the firm for a candidate for the top job, with a view to finding someone with a very strong background in the pharmaceutical industry and good knowledge of the U.S. market. Sanofi said this week that it plans to shrink its embattled cancer business and narrow the focus within Genzyme\u2019s research unit as part of a wider   of research and development.

Daum Kakao Corp. may take its two-month-old KakaoTaxi app overseas, with New York among the cities being considered, according to John Jung, director of business development, who said a decision hasn\u2019t been made. Kakao has more than 2 million cumulative bookings and signed up about a third of the nation\u2019s taxi drivers, he said. \u201cTo be honest, even we didn\u2019t expect the market reaction to be this hot,\u201d Jung said in an interview. \u201cWe wanted to focus on the basics and there was a lot of communication and actual meetings with the drivers in the process of the development.\u201d KakaoTaxi\u2019s popularity in South Korea contrasts with Uber, the car-ride booking app that has inspired similar services around the world. Uber in March had to suspend a service for booking private cars after the government deemed it to be illegal and in February   outside the hotel in Seoul where David Plouffe, a senior vice president at the time with the company, held a press briefing. Shares of Daum Kakao rose 2.5 percent to 117,000 won at the close of Seoul trading, to their highest since May 29. Jung says Kakao\u2019s success comes from its willingness to work with the government and taxi industry. The company held briefing sessions for the taxi drivers from January to get as many to sign on as possible before the official introduction of the service in March, Jung said. KakaoTaxi is also popular with commuters because its software can calculate how long a cab will take to reach the passenger by assessing real-time traffic, Jung said, cutting down the chances that a taxi may be nearby but stuck in traffic.

The French drugmaker also increased the number of people promoting its diabetes products and put in place stronger pay incentives for them, according to Chairman Serge Weinberg. Diabetes is Sanofi\u2019s biggest business, accounting for more than 20 percent of sales. \u201cThere has been a very strong reshuffle,\u201d Weinberg said as the Paris-based company reported earnings. \u201cThe basics have been put back, the proper incentive, the reinforcement also of the sales force to be able to cover the market.\u201d Sanofi surprised investors on Oct. 28 with a tepid forecast for its best-selling product, an insulin called Lantus that diabetics use to control the amount of sugar in their blood, and ended Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher\u2019s six-year tenure the next day. Lantus lost ground in the U.S. to Novo Nordisk\u2019s Levemir insulin, which was cheaper and came with more rebates, Weinberg said today. Sanofi said on Nov. 20 that revenue from diabetes treatments will be flat to slightly higher through 2018. The market share erosion to Levemir had been about 2 percent annually in the past three years. It has stabilized in the past 10 weeks, Peter Guenter, Sanofi\u2019s executive vice president for commercial operations, said today. \u201cOver the last two or three years or so we lost consistent market share against a product that frankly has nothing to offer compared to Lantus,\u201d Guenter said. Besides staff changes and new hires, Sanofi has now trained its sales teams to better focus the marketing message and improve the interaction with doctors. \u201cAll this work seems to be starting to bear fruit,\u201d he said at a press conference in Paris. Today\u2019s report shows Lantus sales accelerated in the fourth quarter, rising 11 percent compared with an 8 percent gain in the prior three months. Lantus, which last year garnered 6.3 billion euros ($7.16 billion) in sales, starts losing patent protection this month. The company is looking for future growth from a new insulin called Toujeo, and an inhaled version of the treatment called Afrezza, which it licensed from MannKind Corp. for as much as $925 million in August.

While Sanofi\u2019s key diabetes business faces stalling sales, the company said in November that by 2020 it plans to introduce 18 products that could garner cumulative sales of 30 billion euros ($34 billion) over the first five years. The planned introductions include Toujeo, a successor to the blockbuster Lantus diabetes treatment, and the world\u2019s first vaccine against the mosquito-borne illness dengue, as well as Praluent. The U.S. accounted for 34 percent of Sanofi\u2019s $44.9 billion in sales last year, and is where most of Sanofi\u2019s new products will be introduced first, according to Weinberg. \u201cThe U.S. is important to us,\u201d he said. Weinberg interviewed a dozen candidates for the job and the drugmaker\u2019s nomination committee had \u201cintense discussions\u201d with four of them, he said, before Brandicourt was picked. Not all of the candidates were French. Sanofi\u2019s board voted unanimously on Oct. 29 to fire Viehbacher, 54, after a six-year term in which he overhauled the research operation to focus on biotechnology drugs. The previous day, he had surprised investors by saying sales at the diabetes division wouldn\u2019t grow in 2015, sending the share price tumbling the most in almost 16 years. Under Viehbacher, Sanofi acquired Genzyme in 2011 for $20.1 billion and also forged partnerships with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. to revamp the company\u2019s pipeline. While Sanofi is in no need of acquisitions today and will remain \u201cvery disciplined\u201d on dealmaking, the company could benefit by strengthening some of its businesses, Weinberg said in the interview. \u201cWe have to be ready to seize opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like us to be a little bit more proactive than what we\u2019ve been\u201d since 2011.","timestamp":1424375606.0,"participant_ids":["SAN:FP","BAYN:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-19\/sanofi-names-bayer-s-brandicourt-as-ceo-after-viehbacher-firing","subject":"Brandicourt as Sanofi Chief to Focus on Taking Drugs to U.S."},{"body":"     (Bloomberg) -- AstraZeneca Plc sued Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to sell a generic version of the breast cancer drug Faslodex.

It\u2019s a robot. In the station concourse, five little automatons dance to a song by K-Pop girl band  . This is South Korea\u2019s steel city, the birthplace of Posco which fed the country\u2019s industrial rise to become the world\u2019s biggest producer of crude steel by the end of the last century. Yet, nowhere better illustrates the efforts to wean the country off its dependence on the giant companies that transformed the economy. Posco was part of the industrial plan championed by former dictator Park Chung Hee, which gave rise to the family-run conglomerates, called chaebol, that still dominate the economy, groups like Samsung and Hyundai. Now his daughter, President Park Geun Hye, is trying to roll back their influence and encourage high-tech entrepreneurs to create a \u201csecond miracle on the Han river.\u201d \u201cWhat is of paramount importance if Korea is to better compete with the rest of the world is to enable young Koreans with creative ideas to freely take on the challenge of starting a business,\u201d Park said on Sept. 25 in written   to Bloomberg News. \u201cGroundbreaking changes are sweeping across our startup and venture communities.\u201d She said that the number of newly established business entities exceeded 80,000 for the first time last year, when venture investments reached the highest level. The visions of Park and her father merge in Pohang. Here are steel mills, chemical plants and shipyards. Here also are Posco\u2019s Pohang   of Science and Technology, a light accelerator, one of the country\u2019s biggest clusters of scientific research centers, and a robot museum. A block away from the museum is a \u201ccreative economy\u201d center, one of 17 startup incubators that are part of Park\u2019s $18-billion program to boost entrepreneurship. South Korea isn\u2019t the only developed country trying to replicate Silicon Valley\u2019s cauldron of innovation, but the efforts of successive presidents to boost science and technology give it an unusual edge. The country has raised   on research and development every year since 1991, lifting it 20-fold in the time to $15 billion, and putting it first in R&D in the Bloomberg Innovation  . It is also one of the most-wired nations on Earth. It has the sixth-highest   broadband subscribers per 100 people among OECD nations and the fastest Internet download speed. Yet much of that success is due to the very entities that have been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation. Companies like Samsung Electronics Co., the world\u2019s biggest maker of smartphones and memory chips, have traditionally creamed off the best graduates from the top colleges every year. \u201cBig corporations were safe throughout most of the 20th century, but they have been challenged by global competition, the drive for low wages, international mergers and acquisitions and the growth of multi-dimensional data analytics,\u201d says John Howkins, a British consultant who coined the term \u201ccreative economy\u201d in his 2001 book. \u201cIt is now safer for someone to take charge of their own destiny, develop their personal portfolio of skills and move between a cluster of employers and clients.\u201d With South Korea\u2019s big corporations increasingly being   by competitors in China, some of the nation\u2019s brightest minds are heeding that call. Across the street from the crucible-shaped university library are the offices of  , a company started by former Samsung SDS and Intel Korea engineer Jun Bong Jin, who is trying to crack one of computing\u2019s hardest goals: how to get robots to recognize things by sight. Jun, who inhaled carbon monoxide till he passed out as an experiment as a small boy, has assembled a group of coders to build software that   the most prizes in a competition in France this year, sponsored by the International Association for Pattern Recognition. \u201cI quit Intel because I wanted to work freely,\u201d Jun said, wearing a T-shirt, as one of his employees showed up for work at noon. \u201cAs long as you love what you do, what you wear, when you show up and how you work don\u2019t matter.\u201d Those around him typify the growing appeal for many young Koreans of this approach. In a massage chair in the center of the room, algorithm engineer Sung Myung Chul is laughing at a joke on his mobile phone, while former computer-game developer and professional rapper Cho Kuk Hyun types nearby on two keyboards at once. Others are busy hunched over laptops or testing the software with  : hardware architect Lee Su Hyun, who was shocked with electricity as a boy while experimenting with a wall socket and a pair of metal chopsticks; coder Lee Myung Jin, who ran a fried-chicken restaurant at college; and Jun\u2019s five-year-old son, who\u2019s at a desk watching the Disney Channel. They share the space with a hamster, two stag beetles and a tank of small fish (a pet chicken was exiled for being too smelly.) One of Jun\u2019s biggest challenges is the one that bedevils entrepreneurs everywhere -- funding. Unlike the startups in the government-backed center next door, he\u2019s relying on his savings because it gives him more control. Finding investors in South Korea isn\u2019t easy. Mergers and acquisitions account for only 2 percent of how investors make a profit on backing start-ups, deterring them from looking for the next YouTube or  . And it takes an average 12 years for a South Korean venture to list on the stock exchange. Kim Hyoung Ki, chief executive officer of biotech company Celltrion, which now leads the tech-centered Kosdaq index, recalls being rejected by every South Korean investor he visited when his company decided to quit contract manufacturing in 2009. \u201cWe were taking a chance by trying to build our own product, but it scared investors away,\u201d Kim said in his office in Songdo, west of Seoul. He then produced the fountain pen used to sign a deal in 2010 with Singapore\u2019s Temasek Holdings. \u201cWe were wading through a valley of death, and we found relief overseas.\u201d Park pointed to investment from companies like Cisco, Intel and SoftBank as a sign her policy is working. Her \u201ccreative economy\u201d centers operate in collaboration with major companies, including the chaebol. Competitive small-to-medium sized companies and invigorated local economies are essential to address the   facing the country, Samsung Electronics said in an e-mailed replied to questions. Samsung welcomes entrepreneurship and already operates an internal \u201cCreative Lab\u201d for staff to challenge themselves, it said. Seoul-based Woowa Brothers is one beneficiary, drawing $36 million from a Goldman Sachs consortium last year for a smartphone app that delivers everything from pork hocks to sashimi.

As he sweeps floors and wipes desks with his staff in a weekly company ritual, 40 year-old jeans-clad executive Choi Jung Yi sums up why Korea\u2019s young talents are increasingly abandoning the traditional path. \u201cWhen my parents were young, Korea\u2019s economy was booming like a rocket,\u201d said Choi. \u201cIt no longer is.

Ablynx, which already has partnerships with AbbVie Inc. and Merck & Co. in the U.S. and other companies in Europe, has caught the eye of more potential partners as the Ghent-based company uses fragments of llama antibodies to develop proprietary therapeutic proteins called nanobodies, which have the potential to attack a range of human diseases. \u201cThere is certainly interest in a number of areas from other companies with whom we currently don\u2019t collaborate in accessing this nanobody technology,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Edwin Moses said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how that develops over the rest of the year.\u201d Ablynx has three flagship products in development, with the most advanced being a treatment for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or TTP, a rare disease that can lead to micro blood clots and is potentially life threatening. This is set to enter the last of regulatory trials before registration in the second half of this year, and Ablynx expects to file for conditional approval in Europe in 2017 and for approval in the U.S. after completion of phase III trials. The company is currently weighing options for marketing and selling TTP in Europe and the U.S. following approval. Ablynx hired Johan Heylen as chief commercial officer in November to head the marketing effort and expects to give an insight into its strategy when the company reports second-quarter earnings in August. Heylen is in discussions with companies experienced in marketing orphan drugs, potential partners and other agencies and contract sales forces, as well as evaluating how best to get the product to the patient. Prior to his appointment, Heylen was executive director and head of sales of cancer immunotherapeutics at GlaxoSmithKline Plc. \u201cThe more we learn about the product and market, the more enthusiastic we are about the potential,\u201d Moses said. \u201cI think it\u2019s certain that we will want to be retaining quite some degree of control in the commercialization of this product, exactly how much is yet to be determined.\u201d Ablynx\u2019s current partnerships also include Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Merck Serono and Novartis AG. The company plans on building on existing partnerships and at the same time has attracted interest from potential new partners. \u201cWe estimate that from our partners there could be three new programs enter clinical trials\u201d this year, Moses said. \u201cWith them come important milestones as well, so we get cash payments as those products enter phase I.\u201d Shares in Ablynx have risen 11 percent this year, giving the company a market value of 545 million euros ($617 million). The stock is up 44 percent since its initial public offering in 2007. The two other flagship products in development are a treatment for respiratory syncytial virus infection, or RSV, in infants and a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in partnership with AbbVie, both potentially representing multibillion-dollar opportunities, according to Moses. The inhaled treatment for RSV is in phase IIa clinical trials in infants, switching between the southern- and northern-hemisphere RSV seasons, with results expected in the first half of next year. The condition hospitalizes about 300,000 children a year below the age of five in the U.S. and Europe and is the leading cause of infant hospitalization, according to the company. Results of the phase IIb trials of its treatment for rheumatoid arthritis are foreseen for the second half of next year. AbbVie, its development partner, is the owner of the world\u2019s biggest selling drug in this area, Humira, which generated sales last year of $12.5 billion. The Ablynx product will also enter clinical trials this year for systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs. Another of Ablynx\u2019s partnerships is with Merck & Co. to develop cancer immunotherapies, or drugs to help the body fight cancer. Merck is responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products resulting from the collaboration, with Ablynx eligible to receive as much as 1.7 billion euros in potential milestone payments plus royalties. \u201cThe discovery activities in immune oncology are one example of where our platform, the nanobodies, can do things we think that other technologies can\u2019t,\u201d Moses said. \u201cFrom an early discovery point of view, that\u2019s an area of considerable focus for us at the moment.\u201d The nanobodies are derived from fragments of heavy-chained-only antibodies from llamas.","timestamp":1431515635.0,"participant_ids":["ABLX:BB","1016055D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-13\/llama-based-biotechnology-draws-new-interest-to-ablynx","subject":"Llama-Based Biotechnology Draws New Interest to Ablynx"},{"body":"     (Bloomberg) -- The American Civil Liberties Union has asked a federal court in Virginia for permission to file a friend-of-the-court brief in the trademark suit involving the name of the Washington Redskins National Football League Team.

Almost a year later, those projections look shaky as rivals are moving ahead of the company in immune therapies for cancer, one of the hottest areas of drug development. AstraZeneca is trailing three competitors with drugs that target lung cancer by harnessing the body\u2019s immune system, according to a report by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. While Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. was   to sell its Opdivo treatment for the condition March 4, AstraZeneca\u2019s rival compound, MEDI4736, is still in trials and probably won\u2019t be submitted to U.S. regulators until next year. \u201cAstraZeneca is not in a leadership position,\u201d said Nicholas Turner, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP in London, who recommends selling the company\u2019s shares. \u201cIf you\u2019re first mover, you could have a blockbuster. If you\u2019re fourth mover, unless you have something really significant as an advantage, it\u2019s difficult to see how you compete.\u201d If AstraZeneca can\u2019t show revenue progress, the shares, carrying a high relative valuation, could slump to the point where the company becomes vulnerable to another takeover bid, Turner said. AstraZeneca is trading above 70 times its per-share earnings, more than twice the average of its Bloomberg Intelligence peer group of 13 large U.S. and European drugmakers. The shares traded at 48.30 pounds as of 11:13 a.m. in London on Friday. A close at that price would be a record. The stakes are high for AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot. He successfully resisted a $117 billion takeover attempt from Pfizer Inc. last year, telling investors his company could grow by itself to $45 billion in revenue by 2023 from $25.7 billion in 2013. To get there, he needs drugs to become huge sellers, and MEDI4736 is unlikely to be one, according to Turner. The company is confident it will meet its long-term revenue goals and is making significant progress, said Esra Erkal-Paler, a company spokeswoman. Oncology drugs potentially could generate a quarter of sales by 2023, she said. Last year, they accounted for 12 percent. MEDI4736\u2019s greatest benefit to patients will be seen when it\u2019s combined with other drugs, separating it from competitors, said Bahija Jallal, who heads the AstraZeneca unit that discovered the drug. \u201cWe have the breadth in our portfolio to test multiple combinations,\u201d Jallal said. AstraZeneca is running trials of AZD9291, a non-immune therapy, in lung-cancer patients with a specific genetic mutation who relapsed after earlier treatment. It\u2019s in a race with Clovis Oncology of Boulder, Colorado, to be first to a market that could be worth $3 billion in annual sales. Some analysts see reason for optimism. AstraZeneca\u2019s immune-oncology pipeline is \u201cunder appreciated,\u201d said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies LLC in New York, who calls AstraZeneca his top pick among European pharmaceutical makers. The company is also developing treatments for heart disease, diabetes and respiratory illnesses. Even if all the drugs come through, AstraZeneca will still be hard-pressed to reach its 2023 goal, especially because two of its current biggest sellers, Nexium and Crestor, face declining sales as they lose patent protection, Turner said. For now, lung cancer is capturing much of the research focus and investor attention because so many people have the condition and its tumors resist standard chemotherapy. Instead of assaulting tumors directly, the newer drugs target proteins that prevent the body\u2019s immune system from fighting the cancer. Goldman Sachs estimates the market for the drugs in lung cancer will be worth $12.3 billion in 2020. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate Opdivo sales of $5.8 billion that year, compared with $1.3 billion for MEDI4736. Both drugs target proteins known as PD-1s and PD-L1s. Merck & Co. and Roche Holding AG are also working in this arena for lung cancer and may beat AstraZeneca to the market, the Goldman Sachs report said. Until the drugs are tested against each other, there won\u2019t be much to differentiate them, said Colin White, an analyst with Datamonitor Healthcare, a London research company. That gives the first drugs on the market an advantage, he said. Astra is testing MEDI4736 with 14 other drugs, including other immune therapies, in early-stage trials. Jallal is most optimistic about combining MEDI4736 with tremelimumab, a different kind of immune therapy that blocks CTLA4, a protein that can switch off a patient\u2019s immune response. The company plans to test the duo in a range of tumors. AstraZeneca\u2019s combination has major promise, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Partners, in a December note to investors because of the possibility that its PD-L1 target is more effective paired with other drugs than the PD-1 used by Bristol-Myers. Putting two drugs together can result in increased side effects, White said. Yervoy, a Bristol-Myers drug that attacks the same CTLA4 protein as tremelimumab, produced reactions including hepatitis and intestinal inflammation in 10 percent of its trial patients, who had to be taken off the compound. \u201cThat\u2019s the downside to these combinations,\u201d White said. \u201cThe plus side is you\u2019re looking at vastly more effective treatments.\u201d The first safety data for AstraZeneca\u2019s combinations will be presented later this year at a conference in Chicago. Even in combinations, AstraZeneca faces competition. Bristol-Myers is putting Opdivo together with Yervoy, which was approved to treat melanoma in 2011. Merck and Roche are also testing their PD-1s and PD-L1s with Yervoy. The crush of new lung cancer drugs on the market may result in insurance companies refusing to cover one or more unless they lower their prices, Mirabaud\u2019s Turner said. AstraZeneca needs MEDI4736 to be a blockbuster to reach its targets, and given all the obstacles \u201cit\u2019s difficult to see how that could happen,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1426816860.0,"participant_ids":["AZN:LN","BMY:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-20\/astrazeneca-lags-in-cancer-race-where-losing-may-invite-takeover","subject":"AstraZeneca Lags in Cancer Race Where Losing May Spur Buyout"},{"body":"Swiss banks led by Credit Suisse Group AG are stepping up operations in Luxembourg, using the rival market as a gateway to clients in the 28-nation European Union. Roiled by the erosion of financial secrecy that helped make Switzerland the top offshore wealth center, and an impasse in Swiss-EU political relations, the banks are seeking to build a stronghold in Luxembourg will help them comply with new EU financial rules.  Pictet and Lombard Odier, Geneva\u2019s two largest private banks, are also expanding their base in Luxembourg. They are among at least a dozen Swiss firms in the country, of which at least seven have established or built up banks there in the past three years, according to data published by the financial regulator known as the CSSF. Luxembourg is vying with London and Frankfurt to be the preeminent hub for banks and fund managers to export their services across the EU. While it once relied on the pull of bank secrecy and tolerance of multinationals\u2019 tax avoidance structures, Luxembourg\u2019s swift adoption of EU laws and rules for \u201cpassporting\u201d fund administration and other financial services across the continent have swelled assets under management at its banks. At half the size of Rhode Island, the country of 560,000 people is teeming with financial firms that hold more than 3.5 trillion euros ($4 trillion) in investment funds. About $700 billion of private wealth is booked in the country,\u00a0compared with some $4.9 trillion held in Switzerland for affluent individuals and families, according to Boston Consulting Group. \u201cWe want to double the amount of money we book in Luxembourg in three years,\u201d Romeo Lacher, head of private banking for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Zurich-based Credit Suisse, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound anchor in the European Union.\u201d Any appreciable increase at Credit Suisse would be a boon for the industry in Luxembourg. The bank is the world\u2019s fourth-biggest wealth manager and Luxembourg is one of its largest booking centers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa outside of Switzerland. It doesn\u2019t disclose assets under management by country, a spokesman said. Negotiations between the EU and Switzerland to allow each other greater access to their financial markets have stalled since Swiss voters in February 2014 backed a referendum to restore strict quotas for immigration from EU countries.\u00a0 \u201cThe banking sector is seeing itself marginalized and even risks being excluded from the large European market,\u201d Patrick Odier, chairman of the Swiss Bankers Association, told reporters in Zurich on Thursday. Odier is also senior managing partner at Lombard Odier. At present, Swiss banks aren\u2019t allowed to solicit or call EU clients from Switzerland as it\u2019s not one of the 28-member countries. They are supposed to serve them locally in their country of residence, via a hub in another EU jurisdiction, or ask clients to visit them in Switzerland. \u201cWe dream about free provision of services throughout the EU and you can have that in Luxembourg,\u201d Nicola Battalora, an executive\u00a0who oversees the Luxembourg business for BSI SA. The bank is based in Lugano, the Italian-speaking region of southern Switzerland. Credit Suisse has grouped branches in France, Austria, Portugal and Greece under its unit in Luxembourg. It also serves private clients from other countries in and outside the EU there, and expects much of its asset growth to come from ultra-wealthy clients with at least 50 million Swiss francs ($52 million) to invest, Lacher said. Lombard Odier, registered in Geneva as Cie. Odier SCA, increased Luxembourg staff to 100 from \u201ca few dozen\u201d four years ago when the company started to accelerate its expansion in the country, said Frederic Rochat, one of six managing partners at Geneva\u2019s oldest bank, which oversees 209 billion francs. \u201cWe certainly expect to grow there,\u201d he said. Pictet & Cie. Group SCA\u2019s Luxembourg office grew to 400 staff in June, versus 326 in 2010, and is the spearhead for expansion in the EU, according to a company official. Union Bancaire Privee and Mirabaud SCA of Geneva also cemented Luxembourg as a key banking center for Europe outside Switzerland in the past three years. As more than 60 countries prepare for a bank data exchange system that destroys old secrecy advantages, Luxembourg is competing more aggressively with other European financial centers, according to Olivier Marechal, head of financial services at EY Luxembourg. It\u2019s cheaper than London and has good public services and international schools, Marechal said. A referendum on the U.K.\u2019s membership in the EU slated for 2017 makes Frankfurt the other obvious location.\u00a0Julius Baer Group Ltd., the third-largest Swiss wealth manager, already made Frankfurt its primary EU booking center. Proximity to the European Central Bank may draw UBS Group AG, Switzerland\u2019s No. 1 lender, there for its EU wealth management hub. \"No final decision has been made yet on the location for the EU hub,\" said Serge Steiner, a spokesman for UBS. \u201cSwiss private banks will continue to pursue a hub strategy in the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carre, who heads the banking practice for PwC Luxembourg. \u201cLuxembourg has plenty of advantages, but it\u2019s not the only option.\u201d","timestamp":1442516460.0,"participant_ids":["CSGN:VX","2539Z:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-17\/credit-suisse-seeks-to-build-luxembourg-hub-as-eu-gateway","subject":"Credit Suisse Seeks to Build Luxembourg Hub as EU Gateway"},{"body":" Lunch was a bit awkward. It was around 1 p.m. on a warm October day in New York. A group of Wall Street investors were tucking into chicken in a red-wine demi-glace and Brussels sprouts at the Plaza Hotel. They\u2019d convened for Jim Grant\u2019s fall conference, hosted by the influential editor of Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer. The lunch speaker was Marty Lipton, legendary lawyer and veteran defender of management in countless proxy battles, hostile takeovers and corporate raids. His talk, which he had titled \u201cActivist Interventions and the Destruction of Long-Term Value,\u201d took aim at a strategy being used with increasing success against his clients and other corporations. \u201cIt begins when an alpha wolf spots his prey and decides to move in for the kill,\u201d Lipton said. He never addressed anyone directly, but it was clear his words had a target. William Ackman, billionaire founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, sat a few feet in front of the speaker, listening quietly, Bloomberg Markets will report in its February issue. Ackman, 48, is one of the most famous hedge-fund activists in the world. Just about everyone in the room knew about the tensions between the two men. Earlier in the year, Ackman had teamed up with one drug company, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., to take over another, Allergan Inc. --  a client of Lipton\u2019s firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Both sides had sued; each was accusing the other of misconduct. In September, Ackman had written a letter to the Allergan board, saying the board\u2019s refusal to engage with him would ultimately prove an embarrassment to the directors. \u201cThe smell of strong brew is in the air,\u201d Ackman wrote. \u201cNow is the time to wake up.\u201d It was hard not to watch Ackman as Lipton spoke. \u201cScheming with a hostile acquirer\u201d and \u201cpublishing nasty, vitriolic letters,\u201d Lipton said, ticking off examples of what he called \u201cscorched-earth activism.\u201d If Ackman knew any of the barbs were meant for him, he didn\u2019t let on. His expression was inscrutable. When Lipton finished, the room got quiet. Grant, the host of the day, stood up, gestured toward Ackman and said, \u201cThe alpha wolf \u2026.\u201d Right now, Ackman is on top of the hedge-fund world. Thanks in part to his move on Allergan, the maker of Botox, Pershing Square International posted a return of 32.8 percent for the first 10 months of 2014, making it the No. 1 fund in Bloomberg Markets\u2019 annual ranking of the best-performing large hedge funds. And that was before the Allergan battle came to a head in November. By year\u2019s end, Pershing Square International had gained another 10 percentage points. (In addition to the International fund, Pershing Square has three other funds; all four funds hold the same positions.) A year ago, the outlook was different. Heading into 2014, Ackman seemed to be in trouble. His long position in JC Penney Co. and short position in Herbalife Ltd. had both gone disastrously wrong, losing hundreds of millions of dollars and making him the target of public ridicule. At JC Penney, his handpicked CEO had failed. Herbalife was an even bigger debacle: Other big hedge-fund managers openly derided his $1 billion bet against the nutritional supplement company and his insistence that it was a pyramid scheme. Carl Icahn, the activist who\u2019s been at this the longest, called Ackman \u201ca liar\u201d and \u201ccrybaby\u201d on television. Allergan put those troubles in the past. In April, Ackman stunned Wall Street with news that he had acquired almost 10 percent of Allergan\u2019s stock and was backing Valeant in a $46 billion bid to take over the company. Almost immediately, Allergan\u2019s stock began climbing. Ackman\u2019s stake rose by close to $1 billion within weeks of the announcement. The bid launched a fierce hostile campaign for shareholder votes. Those votes will never be tallied. In November, Allergan escaped Valeant and Pershing Square by signing a merger agreement with rival drug company Actavis Plc. The deal was valued at $66 billion. In seven months\u2019 time, Pershing Square\u2019s Allergan stake had risen in value by more than $2 billion, to $5.7 billion. \u201cBill Ackman Just Perfectly Executed The \u2018Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\u2019 Trick That Makes Wall Street Famous,\u201d a Business Insider headline declared. Now, Ackman has more than $18 billion to work with, up from $11.5 billion as 2014 began. From the point of view of a potential target, he\u2019s become 50 percent more dangerous. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a CEO or board right now not thinking about how to plan for the possibility of an activist coming in,\u201d says Dean Scarborough, chief executive officer of office products company Avery Dennison Corp. (Scarborough has an expert close at hand: David Pyott, the CEO of Allergan, is a company director.) In November, when Ackman announced he\u2019d acquired an 8.5 percent stake in Zoetis Inc., a maker of animal health products, the company immediately adopted a poison pill plan to gird itself for a hostile takeover. The question -- for businesses, markets, the economy  -- is, is Ackman a threat or a sentinel? Ackman wants to talk about that. \u201cI\u2019m challenging Marty Lipton to a debate,\u201d he says in an interview about a week after Lipton\u2019s talk. \u201cAnywhere. For any length of time. Activism: It\u2019s good for America; it\u2019s great for the economy. We should put it on Bloomberg TV. I tell you, people would show up for this.\u201d People might, but Lipton wouldn\u2019t. \u201cThere is no way on earth I would debate Mr. Ackman,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know how I feel about him. It would be beneath me.\u201d One Saturday afternoon in November, Ackman is walking down Amsterdam Avenue on New York\u2019s Upper West Side. \u201cA lot of people viewed 2013 as the end of Pershing Square,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was kind of the perception in the media: JC Penney, Herbalife, Icahn going on TV saying I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d It\u2019s just after Halloween -- the first cold day of the season. There are still pumpkins on stoops, wispy spiderwebs in shop windows. In jeans and a navy raincoat, off duty, out of the limelight, Ackman is open, relaxed -- not quite down-to-earth, but almost. He makes fun of himself; he gossips (off the record); he points out food stuck in a reporter\u2019s teeth. At one point, Ackman stops midstride. He pats down his pockets. \u201cI think I\u2019ve lost my phone,\u201d he says. There is a hint of panic. Whatever is on that mobile -- texts, e-mails, voice mails -- would surely make weeks\u2019 worth of news. Retracing his steps to a crowded coffee shop, Ackman begins rooting around under tables and politely asking diners to check their seats. Eventually, he uses another phone to call his. A cabbie answers; it\u2019s in the back seat. It\u2019s almost impossible to meet Ackman without prejudging him. There are so many stories. A profile in Vanity Fair described a long bike ride on which Ackman was so determined to pull away from fellow billionaire activist Daniel Loeb that he collapsed. In October, Ackman told a reporter that he and some friends bought a $90 million Manhattan condo because he \u201cthought it would be fun.\u201d That prompted Neil Irwin, senior economics correspondent at the New York Times, to write a column titled \u201cA $90 Million Condo Flip Shows What\u2019s Wrong With Financial Capitalism.\u201d Buzzfeed included the condo quote in a list labeled \u201cThe 14 Most Bill Ackman Things Bill Ackman Has Ever Said.\u201d Ackman\u2019s fights with CEOs and boards are famous. He once threatened the chairman of a takeover target with \u201ca nuclear winter.\u201d In July, in his epic three-hour Herbalife presentation, he called the company \u201ca criminal enterprise\u201d and its CEO, Michael Johnson, \u201ca predator,\u201d and he almost cried. People who dislike Ackman really dislike him. \u201cI would rather hang out with drug dealers and prostitutes,\u201d says John Hempton, chief investment officer at Bronte Capital in Sydney. Hempton doesn\u2019t know Ackman personally but is invested in Herbalife. With Allergan, Ackman provoked in a different way. He bought more than 28 million shares in the company knowing he and Valeant were about to try to take it over. Even his critics acknowledged the move was brilliant. (It brought Icahn around; he told CNBC: \u201cI never said he\u2019s not a smart guy. I think the concept of this is good.\u201d) Still, the bid with Valeant raised questions. \u201cAckman\u2019s conduct seems designed to operate on the edges of legality,\u201d says Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ronny Gal, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., attended the presentation at which Ackman described his Allergan plans. He went back to his office and put together a report titled \u201cAllergan: How Can It Be Legal?\u201d He wrote: \u201c[O]ne can\u2019t logically argue that the agreement between Valeant and Pershing Square is \u2018fair\u2019 to other investors in the context of \u2018fair market.\u2019 ... However, fairness is a principle, not a law. Pershing Square ... has carefully designed a vehicle to comply with current law. They may not have clearly violated any laws, but (in our view) have entered some gray zones where a legal challenge is possible.\u201d In August, Allergan filed a lawsuit alleging insider trading. Valeant, Pershing Square and Ackman all deny they broke any rules. The suit is pending. Activists most often go after weak, poor-performing companies. Allergan is not that. The company\u2019s stock has risen 10-fold during the past 15 years as Pyott has built huge brands such as Botox, Juvederm and Restasis. To get higher returns out of this already high-performing business, Valeant planned to cut more than 70 percent of Allergan\u2019s research budget. \u201cWhen you go after companies, where you try to strip mine them\u2014that is really a perversion of what investing is supposed to be,\u201d says David Maris, an analyst covering Allergan in New York for BMO Capital Markets. After an analyst lunch hosted by Pershing Square, Maris hand-delivered a $100 bill to the Pershing Square offices, refusing to let Ackman buy him a meal. \u201cThe only people he cares about are George Washington and Benjamin Franklin,\u201d Maris says. \u201cAll the dead presidents.\u201d What\u2019s surprising here is not that Ackman disagrees with the criticism; it\u2019s how much he struggles with it. He sees himself as one of the good guys. \u201cWe are the white knight always on behalf of the owners of the business,\u201d Ackman says. Defenders of Allergan, he says, won\u2019t acknowledge that the company\u2019s research budget was bloated; he points out that soon after he and Valeant went public with their plans, Allergan itself announced cuts in early-stage research. At one point, in response to a question using the term billionaire, he visibly cringes. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird word; I don\u2019t like what it conveys,\u201d says Ackman, who, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is worth $1.6 billion. \u201cBillionaire sounds like it\u2019s someone who\u2019s all about the money. The only thing money has meant to me is independence.\u201d Raised in Chappaqua, a suburb of New York, Ackman grew up with plenty of money -- his father was a successful real estate broker -- and an ambition to succeed. He bet his father $2,000, everything he\u2019d saved up, that he could get a perfect score on his SAT. He didn\u2019t. He did, however, get two Harvard degrees (undergraduate and business). In 1992, at age 26 and right out of business school, he started his first fund, Gotham Partners LP, with Harvard classmate David Berkowitz. The partners had early successes, but a series of misfires caused them to wind down the firm in 2003. Ackman launched one of his best-known attacks while at Gotham. In 2002, he accused MBIA Inc., a triple-A-rated bond insurer, of being insolvent and shorted the stock. For five years, virtually no one believed him. Finally, in 2007, the financial crisis exposed MBIA\u2019s troubles. The company\u2019s stock collapsed, and Ackman, vindicated, made millions. By then, he was on to Pershing Square, which he had founded in 2003 with $50 million in seed capital from Leucadia National Corp. Since then, Pershing Square has generated annualized returns of 21 percent. \u201cThe reason why people think we are  controversial is because we are doing stuff that just looks different,\u201d Ackman says one afternoon at Pershing Square\u2019s headquarters in midtown Manhattan. \u201cYou can\u2019t make a lot of money doing what everyone else is doing.\u201d The view from this space is breathtaking, a straight shot over Central Park to Harlem. Here, he is in his element. He talks fast; he\u2019s intense, leaning in when he\u2019s emphasizing a point, not breaking eye contact. He clearly gets energized talking about investing ideas that are perceived as unusual or offbeat. \u201cPeople buy debt in bankrupt companies; they don\u2019t buy equity,\u201d Ackman says as he recounts the story of how, in 2008, he began buying shares in  a failing mall operator, General Growth Properties Inc., for 34 cents a share. Pushing it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Ackman restructured the company. He moved a group of its properties into a new entity under the name Howard Hughes Corp. Pershing Square sold its stake in General Growth last February and still owns Howard Hughes. The firm has netted more than $3 billion on an initial investment of $60 million. Pershing Square, for all the money and the media attention, is a small place. There are 65 employees. Many at the firm have known Ackman and one another for years. They stick together; they defend their boss. \u201cThere is a view that if you have a high degree of confidence in your conviction that it is arrogance or hubris,\u201d says Tony Asnes, head of investor relations, who has known Ackman for 24 years. \u201cI sense people who don\u2019t know him or are just reading about him in the press think that\u2019s what he must be, but he\u2019s not.\u201d Ackman\u2019s 12-person investment team meets every Tuesday. \u201cWe are always watching great businesses, waiting for the right time,\u201d says Ali Namvar, who has been at Pershing Square since 2006. Last winter, Namvar helped Ackman score a quiet win with liquor company Beam Inc., in which Pershing Square had a stake of more than 12 percent. He and a team gave Beam\u2019s management extensive research arguing that the time was right for the company to sell itself. A few weeks later, Beam entered into an agreement with Japanese whisky maker Suntory Holdings Ltd. The deal closed in May, and Pershing Square netted more than $1 billion. It\u2019s easy to miss this amidst the public brawling, but some of the firm\u2019s best investments have been its least contentious: Air Products & Chemicals Inc., Burger King Worldwide Inc., Platform Specialty Products Corp. Around Pershing Square, there\u2019s a peculiar algorithm: return on invested brain damage. As in, is this deal worth the headache? Target Corp. wasn\u2019t. At one point, a fund Ackman set up (separate from Pershing Square) to invest in the company had lost 90 percent of its value. Ackman apologized to his investors in 2009 and offered to waive fees in his main funds until they made their money back. JC Penney, another failure, cost Pershing Square $473 million in 2013. Then there\u2019s Herbalife. It\u2019s produced huge headaches, but the story is changing. Ackman took his $1 billion short position in late 2012. Icahn, Loeb and other investors ridiculed him and bought the stock. The shares rose throughout 2013, even as Ackman declared the company a fraud. Ackman estimates that at one point, he was down $760 million. It was widely reported that Loeb briefly set up his Bloomberg terminal message greeting as \u201cNew HLF Product: The Herbalife Enema administered by Uncle Carl.\u201d \u201cHerbalife was the first time there were people hoping we would fail,\u201d Ackman says. \u201cThat was the only time in my career where I actively thought people were trying to harm us.\u201d Of course, he was and is actively trying to harm Herbalife. \u201cWe are exposing a fraud,\u201d he says. Herbalife is under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the SEC. Its share price has dropped almost in half since last summer, to $37.58 as of Jan. 2. Ackman says his position in Herbalife rose $800 million in 2014. On the morning of April 22, David Pyott, CEO of Allergan, woke up to a shock: Ackman had bought 9.7 percent of his company and was backing a rival\u2019s bid to take it over. Pyott was not the kind of manager activists normally target. He is the force who turned Botox into a $2 billion brand. In 2014, Harvard Business Review ranked him the fourth-best CEO in the world. \u201cWe said, \u2018OK, we need to get ready because we are going to war,\u2019\u201d says one close adviser to Pyott who worked with him on the proxy contest. (Pyott declined to be interviewed for this story.) His team began studying Ackman, learning his tactics. One past proxy battle that was useful: the 2012 fight for Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. Here, in a heated contest, Ackman ousted a powerful board. At one point, he sent an e-mail to Chairman John Cleghorn with the subject line \u201cWar and Peace.\u201d He said he\u2019d recently \u201cbecome more interested in military history.\u201d Beyond theatrics, Ackman gave shareholders a reason to vote his way. He painted the incumbents as clubby, outdated, fumbling. He presented shareholders with another option -- a new, highly compelling CEO, Hunter Harrison, who\u2019d successfully run rival railroad Canadian National Railway Co. for a decade. Since Ackman took his stake in October 2011, the stock has more than tripled, to $188 as of Jan. 2. Pyott\u2019s counteroffensive drew from Ackman\u2019s playbook. His strategy started with attacking Ackman\u2019s investment thesis. His team published research raising questions about Valeant\u2019s business model and its accounting. At one point, the Allergan team leaked an e-mail one of Valeant\u2019s own bankers had sent -\u2014 prior to being hired by Valeant -- calling the company  \u201ca house of cards.\u201d Meanwhile, Pyott gave his shareholders an alternative to Valeant. By early fall, he was already in talks with Actavis that would lead to the winning $66 billion bid. In many ways, what happened at Allergan makes the case for shareholder activism. By putting the company into play, Ackman increased its market value almost immediately and, in the end, made shareholders a lot of money. Critics, however, say there are bigger issues. \u201cWe need strong companies to compete in the global economy. Are we better off if companies like Allergan disappear?\u201d asks Bill George, a professor at Harvard Business School and former CEO of Medtronic Inc. The danger, he says, is that well-run companies will be forced to re-deploy resources, change strategy and cut long-term investments to boost earnings and placate activists. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for America; it\u2019s not good for society,\u201d George says. Who\u2019s Next? Activist hedge funds now manage $91 billion, up from $59 billion at the end of 2012, according to research firm eVestment. That money means activists can go after bigger, stronger targets and, increasingly, that\u2019s what they are doing. Take Loeb\u2019s pursuit of Amgen Inc., Icahn\u2019s of Apple Inc., Nelson Peltz\u2019s of Pepsico Inc. At this point, just about every board member and CEO has to be wondering, who\u2019s next? On Dec. 17, Ackman told Bloomberg TV that McDonald\u2019s Corp. could be better run. Immediately, the stock popped 3 percent. \u201cExcuse me, Mr. Ackman? Can I have  your autograph?\u201d It\u2019s a rainy afternoon in early December, just outside Pershing Square\u2019s offices. William Holmes, a recent college graduate with a degree in economics, is shivering in the cold, holding  a notebook. \u201cI\u2019ve studied everything you\u2019ve done,\u201d the young man gushes. \u201cYou are like the Socrates of our time.\u201d Ackman writes the kid a note. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I have a huge fan base,\u201d he says as the beaming young man walks off. Then he turns to head back up to work.","timestamp":1420513201.0,"participant_ids":["AGN:US","HLF:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-06\/love-him-or-hate-him-ackman-now-runs-the-world-s-top-hedge-fund","subject":"Love Him or Hate Him, Ackman Now Runs the World\u2019s Top Hedge Fund"},{"body":" A few miles off the coast of  , a new U.S. industry is emerging from the Atlantic Ocean. That\u2019s where Deepwater Wind LLC is installing a massive steel frame, more than 1,500 tons, that sits on the seabed and juts about 70 feet from the water south of Rhode Island. By the end of next year there will be five of these platforms, each supporting a huge turbine, the first offshore wind farm in U.S. waters. It\u2019s been a long time coming. Offshore turbines have been running in Europe for more than two decades, and U.S. developers have been trying to get steel in the water  . Deepwater expects its project to be the first of many to tap the potential for offshore wind energy in the U.S. \u201cBlock Island is very important to jump start the offshore wind industry in the U.S.,\u201d said Jeff Grybowski, Deepwater\u2019s chief executive officer. Grybowski is leading a group of officials on Monday to tour the site, including Gina Raimondo, the state\u2019s Democratic governor. The five foundations will eventually each support 6-megawatt Alstom SA  , with 100-meter towers (328 feet) and rotor blades spinning with a diameter comparable to the height of the  . The company based in Providence, the state\u2019s capital, is developing   nearby, between Block Island and Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts, with more than 1 gigawatt of planned capacity. Construction isn\u2019t expected to start until the first project is complete. That much larger scale means \u201csignificantly lower costs,\u201d Grybowski said. \u201cStarting with a small project is a way to ramp up the industrialization of the sector.\u201d While there\u2019s plenty of potential energy to harness, offshore wind has been mostly stymied by high costs. Onshore turbines are some of the cheapest sources of electricity, with an average cost of about $85 a megawatt-hour, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Coal costs about $90. Installing equipment at sea is much more difficult, driving up costs to about $175 a megawatt-hour. There are currently about 4.9 gigawatts of offshore projects that have been proposed in the U.S., according to market research company Navigant Consulting Inc. They will dot the Atlantic   from Maine to the Carolinas. There are some tests off Oregon\u2019s Pacific coast and even a few proposals for the Great Lakes. The U.S. Energy Department has invested more than   in offshore wind research, development, and demonstration projects. The U.S. has more than 4,000 gigawatts of potential offshore wind capacity located within 50 miles (80 kilometers) of U.S. coasts, Jose Zayas, office director for the Wind and Water Power Technologies Office at the U.S. Energy Department, said by e-mail. \u201cOffshore wind has the potential to become a major source of clean energy for the coastal and Great Lakes states, which account for more than 75 percent of U.S. electric demand,\u201d Zayas said. It\u2019s unclear when, or if, another offshore project will begin construction, said Amy Grace, an analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance, because utilities are reluctant to purchase the expensive power unless there\u2019s government help. \u201cNothing is next unless there is some form of federal subsidy,\u201d Grace said in an interview. Cost is what scuttled Cape Wind, a proposed $2.6 billion, 468-megawatt project off the coast of Nantucket. It filed its first permit application in 2001 then faced stiff opposition from local residents, who include American Indian groups, fishermen, the Kennedy family and billionaire Bill Koch. National Grid Plc and Northeast Utilities\u2019 NSTAR unit had planned to take power from Cape Wind then suffered criticism about the it raising the cost of power bills. In January, after the project missed a deadline to complete financing, the two utilities filed to   their contracts. New Jersey   in November a proposed Fishermen\u2019s Energy LLC offshore wind farm, citing high prices for power from the project. The Block Island project is backed by $290 million in debt   from Societe Generale SA and KeyBank NA and about $70 million from D.E. Shaw & Co. Underwater cables will deliver power to the grid under a 20-year contract with National Grid. The developer\u2019s next project will be more than 30 times the size of the Block Island project. Deepwater One, with a $1 billion price tag, will be built between Martha\u2019s Vineyard and the project under construction. The   requires utilities to get a certain percent of their power from offshore wind farms starting in 2017. It\u2019s expected to lead to a 200-megawatt offshore wind farm in waters near the Maryland coast. The project may be complete as soon as 2018 or 2020. \u201cThey should have a method for financing with a state subsidy,\u201d said Grace at BNEF. \u201cThat one has a good chance.\u201d (An earlier version of this story corrected the spelling of Jeff Grybowski\u2019s name.)","timestamp":1437726907.0,"participant_ids":["3470094Z:LN","0835248D:US","3470094Z:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-24\/first-wind-turbines-appear-from-atlantic-as-renewables-spread","subject":"U.S. Offshore Wind Power Industry Emerges Off Rhode Island"},{"body":"A court filing in a copyright suit against Cox Enterprises Inc. revealed the script that agents for Santa Monica, California\u2019s Rightscorp Inc. are using as part of efforts to collect money damages from alleged illegal downloaders.

Amended Reexamined Patent Means No Infringement, Court in New Jersey Rules Two specialty-drug companies and their contract manufacturer have defeated a patent claim brought by a New Jersey pharmaceutical company. The case began in November 2010, when MonoSol Rx LLC of Warren, New Jersey, sued the three companies, accusing them of infringing patent 7,824,588. The patent, issued that month, covered a method of making self-supporting active-containing film. Monosol claimed that BioDelivery Sciences International Inc. of Raleigh, North Carolina, MEDA Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Somerset, New Jersey, and Aveva Drug Delivery Systems Inc. of Miramar, Florida, infringed the patent. At issue was the Onsolis pharmaceutical film, made by Aveva and sold by MEDA under license from BioDelivery Sciences International. In a Sept 25 ruling, U.S. District Judge Freda L. Wolfson dismissed the case on all three defendants\u2019 request. She said that the claims of the patent were altered during a process at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office known as reexamination. The amendments MonoSol made were \u201csubstantive,\u201d which let the defendants off the hook for infringement claims made before the changes, she said. According to her opinion, the patent office issued its reexamination certificate for the patent in August 2012, almost two years after the suit was filed. She said that the defendants then could not be found liable for infringing the patent prior to that date. The case is MonoSol RX LLC v.

Union Bancaire Privee, the Geneva-based wealth manager founded by Edgar de Picciotto, said on Jan. 27 the central bank\u2019s recent decisions will have an \u201cadverse impact\u201d on foreign currency income this year and the firm plans to \u201cfactor in some adjustments\u201d to its forecast for 2015. \u201cThe appreciation of the franc has immediately damaged the performance and profitability of banks and their client relationship managers,\u201d said Christian Hintermann, a partner at accounting and advisory firm KPMG AG in Zurich. \u201cIt puts pressure on banks to cut salaries and bonuses.\u201d While closely held private banks probably won\u2019t talk openly about savings plans, publicly traded companies may divulge measures to ease investor concerns. UBS shares declined 7.5 percent since Jan. 14, the day before the SNB move, while Credit Suisse dropped 16 percent. Julius Baer plunged 17 percent.

Swiss private bankers serving millionaire clients typically earn 160,000 francs ($174,000) a year plus a bonus of 20 to 40 percent of base salary, according to  , a recruitment consultant with Page Executive in Zurich. Bankers to the ultra-wealthy -- those with more than $50 million to invest -- can command at least 250,000 francs a year, plus bonus, Surber said. Salaries are already   as constraints stemming from rules to improve tax compliance and client scrutiny are creating fewer roles for a surplus of candidates, according to Surber. Banks are also seeking to limit the hit from the SNB\u2019s 0.75 percent charge on cash deposits by passing the cost on to clients through higher commissions. Both of Switzerland\u2019s largest lenders are among a growing number of banks passing on the cost of negative rates. Lombard, Odier SCA, Geneva\u2019s oldest bank, has said clients with unmanaged accounts of more than 100,000 francs will pay new charges, in addition to the firm\u2019s standard custody fees.

The agreement came after a failed months-long takeover attempt of Allergan by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., which was pushed by activist investor Bill Ackman. The deal will diversify Actavis\u2019s product offerings, which had been focused on generic drugs and more profitable, yet relatively small, brand name products such as Delzicol, an ulcerative colitis treatment. Allergan also makes Restasis, artificial tears for chronic dry eyes, as well as other medical and aesthetic treatments. During Pyott\u2019s tenure, the company\u2019s stock rose from about $8 to more than $240 when the acquisition by Actavis was completed in March.

The letter, published on the PatentDocs.org biotech and drug patent news blog, specified that while the patent has expired for the drug, which Pfizer markets as Lyrica, European patent EP 0 034-061, which covers its use to treat pain, extends to 2017.  That patent doesn\u2019t cover the use of Lyrica to treat epilepsy or generalized anxiety disorder, New York-based Pfizer said.  Pfizer warned that the patent may be infringed, \u201ceven potentially unwittingly\u201d by pharmacists and others in the supply chain if they supply generic pregabalin for use with pain.  The drugmaker recommended that physicians who want to use pregabalin to treat pain should prescribe Lyrica by brand.  Pfizer did acknowledge that both Generics Ltd. and Actavis Group PTC are challenging the validity of the use patent in the English patents court, with a trial set for June.  Pfizer said it believes the pain-use patent is valid and \u201cwill be contesting the case vigorously.\u201d  Apple Inc., maker of the iPhone and iPad, received a patent on a technology that enables users to control their computers without even touching the screen.

Netlist Inc., an Irvine, California-based maker of memory chips, was granted a temporary order barring the manufacturing and sale of a chipset developed by Diablo Technologies Inc. of Ottawa.  In a Jan. 12 ruling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said Netlist established the likelihood it would succeed on claims related to supply and nondisclosure agreements between Netlist and Diablo. She said Netlist hadn\u2019t met a higher burden of proof that would require a recall of the chipsets that had already been shipped.  Netlist claimed that after it created a memory-interface technology and contracted with Diablo to make the chips, Diablo stole the trade secrets for its own products. According to court papers, the supply agreement with Diablo didn\u2019t give it the right to use the designs and technology to build a competing product.  The court found that the head start Diablo achieved thanks to Netlist\u2019s technology caused enough harm to the California company that money damages alone wouldn\u2019t remedy the problem.  The same day the judge issued her order, Diablo filed a request for a stay, with a hearing on that motion set for Feb. 24. Rogers has also advanced the trial date for the dispute to March 9.

Shares of SMA Solar Technology AG, the world\u2019s biggest maker of solar inverters, soared as much as 17 percent Thursday after it said that nine-month orders returned it to profit before tax after a loss a year ago. RWE AG, Germany\u2019s largest power producer, fell as much as 12.1 percent, the biggest drop in the HDAX, after saying 2015 profit will just meet its forecast after third-quarter earnings fell. Based near Kassel in central Germany, SMA benefited from Germany\u2019s support of the solar industry and is now reliant on exports as solar energy expands in Europe and the U.S. Nine-month sales grew 27 percent compared with a year ago, said the company, whose competitors include General Electric Co. RWE makes most of its money from its conventional coal and gas plants. While both SMA and RWE are trying to make money from renewable power, RWE is struggling with its reliance on conventional generation. Wholesale power prices have plummeted as clean energy surges into the power market, making inefficient plants less profitable. RWE has sought to rebuff criticism that\u2019s it doing too little to anticipate the energy shift, pointing out its clean energy engagements. Still, its annual outlays on research and development added up to just 0.2 percent or 110 million euros of 2014 sales of 46 billion euros, the sector\u2019s head Frank-Detlef Drake said Wednesday in Berlin. SMA Solar, with sales of 805 million euros last year, allocated 129 million euros or 16 percent on R&D. Matthias Hartung, chief executive officer of RWE Generation SE, said late Wednesday in Berlin that the company was surprised by the speed of renewable energy\u2019s expansion. Clean power may account for 33 percent of total consumption, a 20 percent rise on the year, the BDEW utilities federation said. RWE may close more power plants, Chief Financial Officer Bernhard Guenther said Thursday. RWE has fallen 56 percent this year, plunging to the lowest level since at least 1992. It\u2019s the biggest loser on the Stoxx 600 Utilities Index of 26 European companies, which has declined 3.3 percent since Jan. 1.

Europe\u2019s largest insurer plans to exit holdings in mining companies and utilities that derive more than 30 percent of their sales or power supply from the fossil fuel, Chief Investment Officer Andreas Gruber told German television station   in an interview. Allianz will sell its shares in those companies in the next six months while holding their bonds until maturity, Gruber said in an excerpt of the interview to be aired on Tuesday evening. Spokesman Nicolai Tewes confirmed the accuracy of the report. Allianz is following the lead of other asset managers that have recently put their fossil-fuel investments into question. Norway\u2019s $900 billion wealth fund was   by the country\u2019s parliament from coal investments in May and Blackrock Inc. said in October that it may convert an existing fund that would eliminate client exposure to fossil-fuel assets. Money managers\u2019 dislike for coal comes in the wake of efforts to curb use of the fuel amid a global commodity rout that has sent European coal prices plunging to their lowest level in at least 8 years, according to Bloomberg data going back to 2007. Allianz took its decision ahead of the world climate summit in Paris, starting Nov. 30, as Group of 20 nations gather to reach a global agreement on how to reduce fossil-fuel use. \u201cWe want to support the talks at the climate summit in Paris in December, but also send a signal for our industry and for capital markets,\u201d Gruber said. Companies that produce carbon dioxide, the gas blamed for climate change, are saddled with rising costs as governments charge them for emissions. Shares of RWE AG, Germany\u2019s largest power producer, have slumped 58 percent this year as it struggles to rebalance its power mix amid the country\u2019s policy shift toward renewable energy. More than 40 percent of the company\u2019s   is based on hard coal and lignite, according to figures posted on RWE\u2019s website in November. The share slump makes RWE the   in the benchmark DAX Index of 30 biggest German companies, which has gained 12 percent since the 2014 market close. Allianz has about 4 billion euros ($4.25 billion) of investments in companies with coal-intensive operations, ZDF reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the industry. The insurer has invested about 2 billion euros in wind power and plans to double that figure in coming years, Gruber said, adding that Allianz expects to generate a return of 5 percent to 6 percent for its clients from this source, according to ZDF.","timestamp":1448340608.0,"participant_ids":["ALV:GR","3364Z:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-24\/allianz-exiting-coal-stocks-on-climate-change-gruber-tells-zdf","subject":"Allianz Exiting Coal Stocks on Climate Change, CIO Tells ZDF"},{"body":" Vestas Wind Systems A\/S fell the most in 1 1\/2 years after executives issued a cautious outlook for 2015, blunting the impact of a recovery in the wind energy industry that allowed its first dividend since 2003. The Danish manufacturer expects sales of at least 6.5 billion euros ($7.4 billion) this year, less than the 6.9 billion euros it generated in 2014. It also sees a margin of at least 7 percent on earnings before interest and taxes before special items, which compared with 8.1 percent last year. After slashing 3,000 jobs since 2011 and closing a third of its factories to survive a plunge in turbine prices, Vestas today reported its first full-year profit since 2010. The guidance for this year raised concerns about the valuation of Vestas shares, which have gained more than 56 percent since the middle of October. \u201cThis is a very conservative guidance,\u201d Jeffrey Vonk, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service Inc., said by phone. \u201cWhile Vestas does have a history of being very cautious on its outlook, a revenue decline is not what I had expected for 2015.\u201d Turbine makers led by Vestas, General Electric Co. and Siemens AG are enjoying record installations and an outlook for further growth this year. They\u2019re also having to cope with increased competition from regional manufactures such as Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. Ltd. in China and Suzlon Energy Ltd. in India, which may keep turbine prices falling this year. Shares of Vestas fell as much as 8.6 percent, or the most since August 2013 to 262 kroner in Copenhagen trading. Chief Executive Officer Anders Runevad said it\u2019s too early to be certain about how the year will shape up for Vestas, although the long-term outlook is sound. \u201cWe are very early into the year,\u201d and orders and installations usually pick up in the second half, Runevad said today in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an early estimate. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have an ambition to improve that, much the contrary.\u201d He brushed off concerns that a slump in oil prices might hurt the industry saying in an interview on Bloomberg Television that \u201cif you look at the direct link between electricity and oil prices, it\u2019s fairly insignificant\u201d and \u201cpositive things\u201d can come from oil\u2019s slump in the form of lower raw materials and transport costs. \u201cThe market knew that Vestas would be conservative, but it still had been hoping for more,\u201d Janne Vincent Kjaer, an analyst with Jyske Bank AS, said today by phone. \u201cThe share price movement today should also be seen in light of the strong share performance of the past days and weeks. And I do see clear upside to the minimum guidance.\u201d Vestas generated net income of 392 million euros last year, beating the 374 million-euro average of 11 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company proposed paying a 3.9 Danish kroner dividend, the first since a string of payouts it ended in 2003 when competition started heating up in the industry. Orders rose 9.7 percent last year to 6.54 gigawatts. Worldwide, wind installations may hit a record 64 gigawatts this year, though prices will fall as much as 4.6 percent in the first half compared with the same period a year ago, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Installations grew 44 percent to 51 gigawatts last year as costs of the technology rivaled fossil fuels, the Global Wind Energy Council estimates. \u201cWind is a rapidly maturing technology,\u201d Steve Sawyer, secretary general of GWEC, said yesterday. \u201cNot only the low prices but also the cost stability of wind power makes it a very attractive option for utilities.\u201d Vestas benefited last year from surging sales in the U.S., where developers took advantage of an expiring federal tax credit. \u201cVestas, today, is a leaner and more flexible and scalable company, and we are prepared for the future challenges of an increasingly dynamic and competitive wind power industry,\u201d Runevad said in a statement. \u201cWe will intensify our focus on ensuring that our products and services become even more competitive across markets, both within the wind power industry and compared to other energy sources.\u201d The company has been bolstering its efforts to obtain and renew servicing contracts where profit margins are higher, while also managing to sell turbines in China and teaming up with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. to make machines designed to work offshore.","timestamp":1423634262.0,"participant_ids":["VWS:DC","3470094Z:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-11\/vestas-to-pay-first-dividend-since-2003-as-profit-holds","subject":"Vestas Drops as Cautious Outlook Blunts Dividend Plan"},{"body":" Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. said first-quarter profit rose almost fivefold as China\u2019s biggest wind-turbine maker got more orders and made early deliveries.

Permira will retain a 9 percent stake. Nomad raised about $500 million through an initial public offering in April 2014, with the purpose of funding an acquisition. Buying Feltham, England-based Iglo will add a business that had sales of about 1.5 billion euros and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of 306 million euros last year.

Diablo Technologies Inc., a Canadian semiconductor maker, won a defense victory in a trade-secrets case brought by Irvine, California\u2019s Netlist Inc.  The July 2013 suit, filed in federal court in Oakland, California, alleged that Ottawa-based Diablo misappropriated trade secrets, violated a contract between the companies, falsely claimed to have invented a patent and infringed Netlist trademarks. Netlist is a maker of computer memory subsystems.  Following a two-week trial, the jury said Netlist didn\u2019t violate a nondisclosure agreement. It also found that none of the eight trade secrets allegedly misappropriated by Netlist qualified as a secret.  The jury rejected Diablo\u2019s claim that another inventor needed to be added to a disputed patent. It did find that Netlist proved its claim of false advertising and trademark infringement against Diablo and awarded the California company a total of only $2 in damages.  The case is Netlist Inc. v.

The case was filed in Nevada federal court in September. Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts accused M\u2019Life Inc. of infringing the \u201cMLife\u201d trademarks related to the resort company\u2019s customer-loyalty program.  MGM Resorts, which operates the Bellagio, MGM Grand and Mirage, said the marijuana company\u2019s use of M\u2019Life would confuse the public and harm the reputation of the MLife marks. It sought a court order barring the dispensary\u2019s use of marks similar to MLife, and asked for money damages, litigation costs and attorney fees.

A federal court in Los Angeles has awarded the defendants in a trade secrets case $45,582 in attorney fees and $4,114 in litigation costs.  The suit, filed in February 2014, is related to a dispute between New Show Studios Inc., a company that packages ideas for television programming and presents them to a licensing agent, and a disgruntled former customer.  The trade-secret allegations come from a connection between a former New Show employee who allegedly shared some of the company\u2019s information with the unhappy ex-customer. The company also objected to accusations made by the ex-customer it said were false.  In addition to trade-secret misappropriation allegations, Pittsburgh-based New Show accused the defendants of violating California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law, invasion of privacy, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, defamation and unauthorized access to computers.  U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder on Monday awarded the two defendants attorney fees and ligation costs related to claims they made under California\u2019s Anti-SLAPP statue, which allows claims by defendants who say they were sued in an attempt to silence and intimidate them.  The court in December granted part of the defendants\u2019 request to dismiss some claims against them. They then sought attorney-fee and litigation-cost awards.  New Show filed an amended complaint Feb. 16 in which the trade-secret misappropriation allegations remain.  The case is New Show Studios LLC v.

The all-share deal, which values Partnership at 668.5 million pounds ($1 billion), will give Just Retirement shareholders control of about 60 percent of the merged firm, which will be named JRP Group Plc, the companies said on Tuesday. Both insurers are controlled by private-equity firms. The two companies have seen earnings and shares slump since the government announced last year it would scrap rules that forced retirees to buy annuities, which guarantee income. In combining with a competitor, Partnership follows Friends Life Group Ltd., also battered by a decline in profitability, which Aviva Plc agreed to take over for $8.3 billion earlier this year. The rule change \u201cdid have a significant impact,\u201d said Just Retirement Chief Executive Officer Rodney Cook, who will lead the combined company. \u201cWe decided we would be much stronger together to attack all the growth opportunities,\u201d particularly in the bulk annuities space. Shares of Partnership fell 0.5 percent to 153.5 pence by 4:13 p.m. in London, giving the company a market value of 622 million pounds. The stock was up 10 percent in earlier trading. Just Retirement\u2019s shares fell 4.6 percent to 189.5 pence. The U.K. deal is the second life-insurance transaction to be announced Tuesday amid a wave of global consolidation. In the  , Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. agreed to buy Symetra Financial Corp. for about $3.8 billion. It also follows Zurich Insurance Group\u2019s announcement last month that it may bid for the U.K.\u2019s RSA Insurance Group, a non-life insurer. Insurers are merging as margins get squeezed amid increased competition from alternative players entering the industry, such as hedge funds, and investment income dwindles from record low interest rates. Permira Advisers and Cinven own about 52 percent of Just Retirement and Partnership, respectively, and will remain partners, Cook said. The combined group will have a market share of about 18 percent in the individual annuity market and 5 percent in the corporate bulk annuity space, Cook said, who expects to continue to expand in both markets. In bulk annuities, insurers take on liabilities from company pension plans to pay retirement income. \u201cTwo small- to medium-sized companies operating in the same market didn\u2019t make sense in a world that has changed since both came to the market,\u201d said Trevor Moss, an analyst at Berenberg in London. \u201cIt makes sense to bulk up capability to make it a viable player.\u201d The companies plan to raise about 150 million pounds of equity capital to help pay about 60 million pounds in integration costs and strengthen capital buffers before stricter European-wide rules, known as Solvency II, come into effect next year.

Perrigo had sought to block the listing, but a regulator ruled in favor of Mylan. The companies are competing for support from Israeli institutional shareholders, which hold about 12 percent of Perrigo. \u201cI am extremely confident we are going to get over the 50 percent,\u201d of the Perrigo stock needed to acquire the company, Chairman Robert J.

Shell\u2019s Pennzoil-Quaker State Wins Battle Against Texas Pit Stop  Royal Dutch Shell Plc\u2019s Pennzoil-Quaker state unit has prevailed in a trademark dispute with the operator of a quick-stop oil-change facility.  In its Feb. 23 ruling, the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said a lower court erred in permitting Miller Oil\u2019s Pit Stop U.S.A. of Houston to continue using Pennzoil marks in spite of a demand that it stop.  The dispute began when Pennzoil discovered that the bulk oil Pit Stop was selling wasn\u2019t from Pennzoil, despite an agreement they had. Under the terms of the deal, Pennzoil marks could be used only with Pennzoil products. Pennzoil demanded that Pit Stop quit using its marks.  Pennzoil sued for trademark infringement and a trial court said the oil-change company could continue to use Pennzoil signs as long as it continued to promote and feature Pennzoil products, didn\u2019t advertise or promote another brand, and bought its products directly from a Pennzoil-approved source.  That wasn\u2019t enough for Pennzoil, which appealed. The circuit court said the lower court abused its discretion in permitting the use of the marks.  The case is Pennzoil-Quaker State Co. v.

A man accused of trying to share advanced U.S. fighter jet information with Iran pleaded guilty to violating a federal arms export control law, the U.S. Justice Department said.  Mozaffar Khazaee, 60, who was arrested a year ago as he was about to board a flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Tehran, entered his plea Wednesday before a federal judge in Hartford, Connecticut. He faces as long as 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine, the Justice Department said in a statement.  The Iranian-born former Manchester, Connecticut, resident worked for three U.S. defense contractors from 2001 to 2013, according to prosecutors.  Starting in 2009, \u201cKhazaee stole sensitive, proprietary and controlled technology to send it to Iran,\u201d prosecutors said. Among that material was jet engine information for the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F35 Joint-Strike and F22 Raptor fighters.  The government began investigating Khazaee, also known as Arash Khazaie, in November when U.S. customs agents inspected a shipment he had sent to Long Beach, California, from Connecticut, bound for Hamadan, Iran, prosecutors said previously.  While documents accompanying the shipment indicated it contained household goods, a search revealed boxes of documents, including technical manuals, specification sheets and other materials related to the F35 program and jet engines, according to court filings.  He faced three counts of interstate transportation of stolen property, each subject to a maximum prison term of 10 years.  The case is U.S. v.

Mylan, which   about 1,400 medications, offered $205 a share in cash and stock for Perrigo, according to a statement Wednesday. That represents a 25 percent premium over Tuesday\u2019s closing price for Perrigo, which makes a range of products including skin gels, injectables and nasal sprays. Perrigo said its board will meet to discuss the proposal and that there\u2019s no certainty an offer will be made. The deal would be Mylan\u2019s biggest, more than four times the size of anything else it has attempted. Mylan\u2019s bid would add to a record period of consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. Mylan   last year to acquire non-U.S. operations of Abbott Laboratories for $5.3 billion as part of a plan to move its tax address to the Netherlands. Perrigo completed a similar tax maneuver in 2013,   Elan Corp. so it could be domiciled in Dublin. Both companies\u2019 operating headquarters remain in the U.S. -- Mylan\u2019s in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, and Perrigo in Allegan, Michigan. Mylan surged 15 percent to close at a record high of $68.36 in New York. Perrigo jumped 18 percent to $195, also a record. While Mylan\u2019s offer for Perrigo was a surprise, a combination of the two companies makes sense, said John Schroer, sector head of U.S. health care at Allianz Global Investors, which holds Mylan shares. \u201cOn the surface between the Mylan brand around the world, the greater scale and distribution strength that they have, I think there is a solid strategic benefit of folding in Perrigo and combining it with Mylan,\u201d he said. In a letter to Perrigo Chief Executive Officer Joseph Papa dated Monday, Mylan Chairman Robert Coury called a deal a natural fit that would create a company with about $15 billion in annual sales. \u201cAs you and I have discussed on a number of occasions over the past few years, a combination of Mylan and Perrigo offers clear and compelling strategic and financial benefits,\u201d Coury wrote. \u201cThis is the right time for our two companies to move forward together, and Mylan and our board are firmly committed to making this combination a reality.\u201d Schroer said it\u2019s fair to assume Mylan went public with its takeover offer because Perrigo\u2019s board hasn\u2019t been open to a deal in prior talks. He said the timing might also be a defensive move amid speculation that Mylan itself was a takeover target of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the Israeli drugmaker. Coury offered to make Papa co-chairman of the combined company, with Mylan CEO Heather Bresch and President Rajiv Malik keeping their roles. Coury proposed that other top Perrigo executives join as well. Generic drugmakers have been actively consolidating recently and moving into new areas. Teva agreed to buy Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc. for about $3.5 billion in March, giving it medications that curb tics and other movement disorders. Actavis Plc agreed to pay about $66 billion for Allergan Inc., the maker of anti-wrinkle treatment Botox, late last year. Mylan\u2019s Bresch has made no secret of the company\u2019s ambitions to expand. In an interview in January, she said the company\u2019s lower tax rate from its move to Europe would give her financial flexibility to \u201cdo some pretty sizable deals.\u201d Mylan was founded in 1961 in West Virginia by two Army veterans who sold drugs out of the back of a Pontiac Bonneville, according to the company. The Food and Drug Administration approved its first medicine, the antibiotic penicillin, in 1966. The company says it makes about one of every 11 medicines prescribed to Americans, including EpiPen, used to treat allergic reactions. Last year, generic drugmakers announced or completed more than $100 billion in deals, worth five times more than any year since at least 2005. Perrigo\u2019s revenue is more diversified than Mylan\u2019s. Last year, half of its $4.06 billion in sales came from its consumer health-care division, including store-brand versions of popular over-the-counter medicine like Sudafed and NyQuil, sold in retailers such as Wal-Mart and Walgreens. It also makes store-brand baby formula, vitamins and dietary supplements. Mylan has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as financial advisers, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore as legal advisers.","timestamp":1428496370.0,"participant_ids":["MYL:US","PRGO:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-08\/mylan-offers-to-buy-drugmaker-perrigo-for-28-9-billion","subject":"Mylan Offers to Buy Drugmaker Perrigo for $28.9 Billion"},{"body":" Israeli stocks jumped the most since September 2013 after drugmaker Mylan NV offered to buy Perrigo Co.

First, they have a takeover offer from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. for $40.1 billion, or $82 a share. Analysts say it\u2019s a decent starting point and likely to go higher because Teva needs the earnings jolt Mylan would provide. Susquehanna Financial Group estimates a bid of up to $90 a share, a 40 percent premium to Mylan\u2019s average price before Teva\u2019s offer. Then there\u2019s Mylan\u2019s $28.9 billion proposal to buy Perrigo Co., a deal that may also be a boon for shareholders. If Mylan could cut at least $800 million of costs from that merger and fund at least 30 percent of the purchase price in cash, then it could afford to pay up to $230 a share and have the deal be immediately accretive, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mylan\u2019s opening bid is $205 a share. \u201cMylan\u2019s in a nice position,\u201d said Chris Pultz, a money manager at Kellner Capital, an event-driven investment firm in New York. \u201cIt can do an accretive deal like Perrigo, or it can get Teva to pay a ridiculous multiple.\u201d Mylan has said it\u2019s not interested in selling to Teva, and Perrigo\u2019s board on Tuesday rejected Mylan\u2019s unsolicited overture. Even so, Mylan has a third option: It may be able to find a white knight such as Pfizer Inc., said Tim Chiang, an analyst at Sterne Agee CRT. An acquisition of the Netherlands-based Mylan would make sense for Pfizer because it would gain even more generic injectable medicines to add to those coming from the Hospira purchase announced in February. That would aid Pfizer\u2019s plan to eventually   its generic-medicines unit, as well as potentially allow the drug giant to use some of the cash it has trapped offshore, Chiang said. Teva\u2019s bid, announced Tuesday, would be funded half in cash and half in stock. It\u2019s contingent on Mylan ending its Perrigo pursuit. Teva is offering more equity than was expected, leaving \u201cample room\u201d to increase the cash component, according to a report by Andrew Finkelstein, an analyst at Susquehanna. He says the deal would be financially attractive for Teva at up to $90 a share but that Mylan doesn\u2019t seem to want to negotiate. A deal for $90 a share would value Mylan at about 27 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, putting it on par with other recent comparable transactions, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At $82, it\u2019s the equivalent of paying 25 times Ebitda. \u201cTeva could push its offer higher without appearing to be paying too much for Mylan,\u201d Sam Fazeli and Asthika Goonewardene, pharmaceutical analysts for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote Tuesday. Liav Abraham, an analyst for Citigroup Inc., estimates a $90-a-share price tag would still be 15 percent to 30 percent accretive, but that an offer shouldn\u2019t exceed that level. Last week, before Teva\u2019s bid was even public, Mylan said a merger with Teva would be \u201cwithout sound industrial logic or cultural fit\u201d and that it probably couldn\u2019t get clearance from antitrust regulators. Teva   the deal because its top-selling drug, Copaxone, is about to begin facing competition from generic copies -- including one developed by Mylan -- which will hit revenue and earnings. Teva estimates $2 billion of annual cost and tax savings. While Mylan would be a timely way for Teva to diversify away from Copaxone, it doesn\u2019t ensure long-term growth and a richer valuation for Teva the way a purchase of a \u201chigher-margin, longer-duration proprietary\u201d drug would, Jefferies Group\u2019s David Steinberg said in a phone interview last week. That means even if Teva buys Mylan, it could later do another deal similar to the $3.1 billion purchase of Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc. that it announced in March, he said. Mylan\u2019s also been on the hunt for deals. The $36 billion company was   by Swedish drugmaker Meda AB last year. And back in 2013, people familiar with the matter said Actavis Plc   an offer from Mylan. In February, Mylan completed its $5.6 billion acquisition of Abbott Laboratories\u2019 generic-drug business in established markets. That transaction allowed it to incorporate in the Netherlands to lower taxes and also provided more firepower for deals. Mylan\u2019s quick rebuttal of Teva\u2019s advances indicates that its \u201cmanagement really has no interest in wanting to get gobbled up by somebody,\u201d David Heupel, a Minneapolis-based fund manager at Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, which oversees about $96 billion, said in a phone interview. \u201cI think they want to be one of the players left standing in that situation.\u201d That said, Mylan\u2019s shareholders have some say on the company\u2019s fate. Even though it has defenses against a hostile takeover, investors would probably get to vote on whether to allow or block the Perrigo deal. Executives \u201cdon\u2019t own the company -- shareholders do,\u201d Huepel said. \u201cIn the end, this will all come down to which shareholder base is going to drive a deal and what does that dictate.\u201d","timestamp":1429629248.0,"participant_ids":["MYL:US","TEVA:IT","PFE:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-21\/mylan-s-three-way-deal-dance-is-a-win-for-shareholders-real-m-a","subject":"Mylan\u2019s Three-Way Deal Dance Is a Win for Shareholders: Real M&A"},{"body":" Mylan NV went forward with a hostile $31.2 billion bid for fellow drugmaker Perrigo Co., opting to take its offer directly to shareholders rather than accept a separate takeover proposal from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. The tender offer would exchange $60 in cash and 2.2 Mylan shares for each share of Perrigo, according to a statement. That amounts to $222.12 a share based on Mylan\u2019s closing price Thursday -- 10 percent above the price of Perrigo\u2019s stock the same day. Perrigo rejected the new offer, arguing it\u2019s not as high as it seems because Mylan\u2019s stock has been inflated by Teva\u2019s takeover offer. Based on Mylan\u2019s share price of $55.31 on March 10, the new offer would be $181.67 a share. Perrigo had rejected Mylan\u2019s earlier proposal of $205 a share, saying it didn\u2019t reflect the value of its growth prospects. The Perrigo deal would be Mylan\u2019s biggest yet and could help the company avoid getting bought by Teva. The Israeli drugmaker had proposed a $40.1 billion takeover earlier this week, saying the offer was good as long as Mylan dropped its bid for Perrigo. Even before that offer from Teva, Mylan had said the companies were a poor cultural fit and had too many overlapping businesses. Perrigo, on the other hand, has complementary products and regional assets, Mylan has said. \u201cWhile we are disappointed by the decision of the Perrigo board to reject our proposal without entering into discussions thus far, we are still hopeful and confident that we can engage with their board about our offer and how to best bring our organizations together,\u201d Mylan Chairman Robert Coury said in a statement. A Perrigo spokesman said the company had no comment. Teva reiterated its offer for Mylan in a statement, saying it remains committed to completing a deal. Unlike Mylan\u2019s earlier proposal in a statement, the offer made Friday was binding under takeover rules in Ireland, where Perrigo is domiciled for tax purposes. Perrigo told shareholders they are strongly advised to take no action on Mylan\u2019s offer. Mylan rose 3.6 percent to $76.31 at 12:13 p.m. in New York. Perrigo fell 3.3 percent to $195. While Mylan gets most of its sales from generic drugs, about half of Perrigo\u2019s $4.06 billion in revenue last year came from its consumer health-care division, including store-brand versions of popular over-the-counter medicine like Sudafed and NyQuil, sold in retailers such as Wal-Mart and Walgreens. Both companies have done deals to move their tax domiciles outside the U.S. to cut costs. Mylan acquired Abbott Laboratories\u2019 European assets last year, and Perrigo bought Dublin-based Elan Corp. in 2013. The love triangle developing between Teva, Mylan and Perrigo is adding to what has already been a record period for mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry. Generic-drug makers announced or completed more than $100 billion in deals last year, five times more than any year since 2005. Actavis Plc agreed to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc. for $65 billion in the biggest deal last year. Mylan is seeking to cement a deal amid speculation that Perrigo could draw interest from other  , such as Johnson & Johnson and AmerisourceBergen Corp. Perrigo is \u201can attractive asset in a rapidly consolidating space,\u201d Chris Schott, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note Wednesday. Schott rates the stock as overweight.

Operating profit at the business, which consists of Newport Beach, California-based Pimco and Allianz Global Investors, fell 14 percent to 555 million euros ($620 million), the Munich-based company said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cPimco is still the biggest construction site at the company,\u201d Roland Pfaender, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Oddo Seydler Bank AG, said by telephone. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge uncertainty when a turnaround will come.\u201d Two years of withdrawals at Pimco\u2019s flagship Pimco Total Return Fund, spurred by the departure of Bill Gross in September, have hit returns at Allianz\u2019s asset management business, the largest in Europe. Allianz replaced Gross with Daniel Ivascyn and added former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke as a senior adviser to the unit in April. Allianz Chief Financial Officer Dieter Wemmer said that client redemptions were expected and other funds were performing well. The company continues to bet on a revival and won\u2019t reduce costs, he said. Pimco posted 68.3 billion euros of net outflows in the quarter, taking the total for Allianz to 62.1 billion euros. The smaller Allianz Global Investors had inflows of 6.2 billion euros. While Pimco\u2019s revenue also dropped 3.1 percent to 1.14 billion euros, fund outflows were less than half of the volume in the previous quarter, Allianz said. \u201cWith the slowing of outflows from Pimco along with Pimco\u2019s excellent three-year investment performance and the ninth consecutive quarter of third-party net inflows at AllianzGI, we are positive about the further development of our asset management segment,\u201d Wemmer said. Allianz\u2019s shares declined 3 percent to 144.95 euros at 4:31 p.m. in Frankfurt. The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index fell 1.8 percent. The Pimco Total Return Fund lost its title of the world\u2019s biggest bond mutual fund to the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund after investors pulled $5.6 billion in April, reducing assets to $110.4 billion. It dropped 1.9 percent in the past month, meaning 96 percent of similar funds beat its performance. Gains this year were 0.6 percent. Pimco Income Fund, with $44.9 billion in assets, rose 3 percent in 2015, outperforming 99 percent of peers. Total assets at Allianz\u2019s asset management unit rose 7.3 percent to 1.93 trillion euros from the end of 2014, driven by market value increases and beneficial currency effects, Allianz said. Revenue at Allianz Global Investors increased by 27 percent to 435 million euros. First-quarter operating profit from asset management was 555 million euros, \u201cin line\u201d with the full-year target of between 2.2 billion euros and 2.8 billion euros, Allianz said. Operating profit in property and casualty insurance fell to 1.29 billion euros from 1.49 billion euros in the year-earlier quarter. The losses were offset by gains in life and health insurance, which posted a 1.1 billion euro profit versus 880 million euros previously.","timestamp":1431396479.0,"participant_ids":["PTTRX:US","ALV:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-12\/allianz-says-asset-management-profit-fell-14-on-pimco","subject":"Pimco Exodus Cuts Allianz Asset Management Profit"},{"body":" Enzo Biochem Inc. fell after an appeals court threw out a $61 million judgment it won against Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\u2019s Applera unit over genetic research and screening. The trial judge in the case erred in interpreting crucial aspects of Enzo\u2019s patent, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in an opinion posted Monday on its website. The case was sent back to district court to determine whether Applera infringes the patent under the revised determination of what it covers. The 2-1 Federal Circuit decision extends what\u2019s already been a protracted fight between the companies -- the lawsuit was first filed in 2004. Thermo Fisher inherited the case last year when it bought Applera\u2019s parent, Life Technologies Corp. Enzo fell 7.6 percent to $3.06 at the close of New York trading, after plunging as much as 23 percent earlier in the day. Thermo Fisher rose 4.4 percent to $132.97. Enzo said it will ask the three-judge panel to reconsider its decision, or have the case heard before all active judges of the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law. The panel should have given more consideration to the jury\u2019s fact-finding, Enzo said in a statement, citing a U.S. Supreme Court   on how much deference the Federal Circuit should give when it comes to deciding what patents cover. The dispute is over a way to detect genetic sequences and diagnose human diseases such as cancer.

The Swiss company received the nomination of Eurocement founder Filaret Galchev after it already put forward 14 board members from both Holcim and Lafarge to run the enlarged company, it said in a statement today. Therefore Holcim\u2019s board won\u2019t include the proposal in the agenda of a May 8 shareholder meeting where investors are scheduled to approve the merger, it said. Holcim Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle earlier this month backed a directorship for Eurocement to blunt the Russian company\u2019s opposition to the merger and Eurocement yesterday said it expects Holcim to \u201chonour their proposal.\u201d The willingness of Eurocement, which owns 10.8 percent stake of Holcim, to join the board was seen by analysts as a sign that the companies are making progress in overcoming lingering opposition to the deal that would create the world\u2019s biggest cement maker with a value of $48 billion. \u201cThe fact that Galchev may not be considered shows that this is not a done deal yet,\u201d said Patrick Appenzeller, an analyst at Baader-Helvea in Zurich. The companies tweaked the original merger agreement in recent weeks to win over Holcim investors who were unhappy about the performance of Lafarge since the deal was agreed last year. The Swiss company will now have a bigger stake in the new entity, and the cement makers also appointed Eric Olsen to lead their combined operation after Holcim shareholders opposed Lafarge CEO Bruno Lafont as head of the new group.

Apple Inc. urged a U.S. trade agency to reject Ericsson AB\u2019s attempt to keep the iPhone out of the U.S. because of a fight over patent royalties.  Ericsson filed two complaints with the U.S. International Trade Commission last month after licensing talks between the companies broke down. Stockholm-based Ericsson asked the agency to block imports of Asia-made Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers.  \u201cAt bottom, Ericsson is using the threat of an exclusion order to coerce a large monetary payment from Apple,\u201d the Cupertino, California-based company said in a filing with the commission.  One of the two complaints relates to patented inventions that are part of industry standards for how mobile devices communicate. Apple has argued that there should be limits on patents for essential technology and that patent owners shouldn\u2019t be able to block others from using such inventions.  Any ban on the import of Apple products \u201cwould cause significant harm to competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, to the labor force, to consumers, and to a broad array of businesses, schools, state and local governments,\u201d Apple told the agency.  The trade agency typically announces whether it has agreed to investigate a complaint about one month after it\u2019s first filed. Investigations take about 15 to 18 months.

Although the U.K.\u2019s High Court has ordered several Internet service providers to block access to the Pirate Bay file-sharing website, most people there have had no trouble reaching the site, TorrentFreak reported.  The reason the blocking is unsuccessful is that Sweden-based Pirate Bay is using CloudFlare Inc.\u2019s cloud-based firewall services, the anti-copyright news website suggested.  San Francisco-based CloudFlare\u2019s network of addresses hides the true location of Pirate Bay\u2019s Internet Protocol address, TorrentFreak said.  TorrentFreak surveyed major U.K. ISPs. It found that while subscribers to Virgin Media, BT, TalkTalk and EE services were able to reach Pirate Bay, customers of Sky Plc\u2019s Internet service remained blocked.  In 2014, almost 89 percent of Internet users in Spain got access to content without authorization, up from 84 percent the previous year, the Advanced Television media-news website reported.  The market value of the material obtained, according to a study commissioned by a Spanish creative-industries coalition, was 23.3 million Euros ($24.6 million), Advanced Television reported.  The study indicated that more than 71 percent of the websites from which people got unauthorized access to content are funded by advertising, with at least a third related to luxury consumer brands, fashion, insurance and television, according to Advanced Television.  If there were no piracy in Spain, the survey estimated, 29,360 direct new jobs would be created, while 100,000 more jobs are indirectly related to the content industries, Advanced Television reported.

The company said it had restored some functionality to the site after customers reported a breach in which they saw videos of young people looking into Web cameras, with the song \u201cBreaking Free\u201d from the movie \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d playing in the background. Some employee e-mails were also leaked by a hacking group called the Lizard Squad, according to postings on Twitter. The group has previously   Sony Corp.\u2019s online PlayStation video-game network.

Last week, Lenovo   to customers and pushed out fixes to remove software made by a company called Superfish that Lenovo pre-installed on many consumer devices. \u201cThis may be another small hit to brand image\u201d for Lenovo, said Dan Baker, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Hong Kong. \u201cIt looks like the hackers were unhappy with the Superfish episode and did this as payback.\u201d The attackers had used a free CloudFlare account to disguise their origins, Prince said, and then redirected traffic from lenovo.com to CloudFlare\u2019s network. CloudFlare disabled the account used by the attackers, Prince said. \u201cOne effect of this attack was to redirect traffic from the Lenovo website,\u201d Lenovo said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cWe are also actively investigating other aspects. We are responding and have already restored certain functionality to our public-facing website.\u201d The Beijing-based company said it was reviewing network security and will take appropriate steps to bolster the site and protect user data. Shares of Lenovo rose 0.3 percent to close at HK$11.90 in Hong Kong trading. The world\u2019s largest PC maker faced a deluge of criticism from cyber-security specialists regarding Superfish\u2019s ability to monitor Web behavior and suggest advertisements based on images that a user might be viewing. The technology essentially broke the encryption between Web browsers and banking, e-commerce and other sites that handle sensitive information, potentially exposing machines to hacking. The hack of lenovo.com was corrected in about an hour, said Andrew Hay, director of security research at OpenDNS, a San Francisco-based security company. Based on publicly accessible information, the attack involved altering the records of Lenovo\u2019s domain-name registrar, which is Web Commerce Communications Ltd., located in Kuala Lumpur. Web Commerce Communications didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages. \u201cThe major walking-away point is all those domains you registered years ago, it\u2019s time to go back and look at the settings,\u201d Hay said. An attack against a company\u2019s domain-name registrar isn\u2019t an attack directly against the company itself. It\u2019s a circuitous way to hijack a company\u2019s website traffic by telling Internet servers to go to a different address than the company\u2019s homepage. Domain-name registrars manage that routing information for companies, and they have been hacked in the past by attackers stealing employees\u2019 passwords and accessing administrative accounts. Twitter Inc. was able to   a similar attack in 2013 that sidelined visitors to the New York Times and Google Inc. by using a simple tool called a registry lock that prevents hackers from making such changes.

Since announcing the planned combination in April to create a cement maker with about $40 billion in sales, Holcim has outperformed Lafarge, on average, in sales performance, profit and cash from operations. Schmidheiny, who owns about 20 percent, seeks a better exchange ratio or special dividend for Holcim shareholders, Switzerland\u2019s SonntagsZeitung reported yesterday, citing people close to the investor and a Holcim director it didn\u2019t identify. Denzler today declined to comment whether Schmidheiny seeks to alter the deal. Holcim also declined to comment.

The stock was down 1.1 percent as of 11:30 a.m. Holcim gained 1.2 percent in Zurich. Holcim and Lafarge agreed last year to merge to unite operations after the global recession eroded demand for building materials, and as increased competition from emerging-market rivals undermined profits.

Whereas traditional bond funds, a fixture in retirement accounts, favor government and corporate debt, managers of the newer funds are typically free to take a stance on the direction of interest rates and buy a range of assets including currencies, bank loans and emerging-market debt. \u201cThese funds promise all sorts of wonderful things,\u201d Ford O\u2019Neil, manager of the $17.8 billion Fidelity Total Bond Fund, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe question is: Can they deliver?\u201d Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based firm that manages $2 trillion, doesn\u2019t offer an unconstrained fund. They haven\u2019t proven their value, according to O\u2019Neil. The flexible managers were hurt last year by their decision to hold bonds of short duration. Duration is a measure of a security\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Securities with shorter duration are less sensitive to changes in interest rates, while those that are longer lose value when interest rates go up. As of Nov. 30, nontraditional funds had an average effective duration of less than 12 months, compared with 4.8 years for the intermediate funds, which hew closer to their benchmark, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. When rates fell in 2014 because of low inflation and weakening economies in Europe and Asia, the intermediate funds benefited more. Unconstrained funds also suffered as high-yield bonds and bank loans tumbled late in the year. \u201cA number of funds substituted credit risk for duration risk, and credit didn\u2019t have a good year,\u201d Rick Rieder, manager of the $26.2 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio, said in a telephone interview, referring to corporate bonds. Rieder beat 83 percent of his nontraditional fund peers in 2014 with a 3.6 percent return for the Class A shares, Morningstar data show. Managers say keeping their duration short made sense, because the funds are supposed to be an alternative to conventional bond investments. Most of the risk in a typical bond fund comes from swings in interest rates, said Laird Landmann, part of the team that runs the $1.7 billion Metropolitan West Unconstrained Bond Fund at Los Angeles-based TCW Group. \u201cWe want this fund to have a low correlation to 10-year Treasuries,\u201d Landmann said in an interview. Given the low level of interest rates in 2014, it didn\u2019t appear to be worth the risk to bet on a further decline, said William Eigen, whose team runs the $23.4 billion JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities Fund. \u201cThe rates-related markets can only be described as downright unattractive,\u201d Eigen wrote in an e-mail. He saw few opportunities in fixed income and kept as much as 65 percent of his fund in cash last year. Eigen said it was unfair to compare the returns of his fund to those of a typical bond fund, because his goal, much like a hedge fund, is to make money in all kinds of markets. As with hedge funds, that\u2019s easier said than done: JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities has had two down years in the past four after losing 0.1 percent in 2014 and 0.3 percent in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some of the unconstrained funds, including Eigen\u2019s from New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co., have no benchmark. Others, such as the BlackRock fund, use the three-month U.S. Treasury bill. The funds, which Morningstar labels nontraditional, gathered almost $56 billion in 2013, as rates climbed and investors looked for a way to guard against further increases once the Federal Reserve signaled it would wind down its asset buying program. Net subscriptions declined to about $22 billion in 2014. Even at that level, the funds attracted more money than any other bond category. The managers pursued varying strategies regarding interest rates last year. The $25.4 billion Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund was poised to take advantage of rising rates. \u201cWe believe monetary policy needs to catch up with growth and that interest rates in the U.S. and U.K. are likely to rise by a significant amount in the next one to two years,\u201d Goldman Sachs Asset Management wrote in a paper published in March. The fund, which lost 0.9 percent last year, had a negative duration of 2.6 years as of Nov. 30, according to New York-based Goldman Sachs\u2019s website. That hurt the fund when interest rates fell. \u201cRates were the fund\u2019s largest detractor,\u201d co-manager Michael Swell wrote in an e-mail. The $11.5 billion Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund, run by Bill Gross until he left Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co. in September, didn\u2019t take a stance on rates because the potential reward wasn\u2019t enough to justify the risk, according to Saumil Parikh, one of the three managers who succeeded Gross. \u201cWe are now bearish on U.S. rates,\u201d Parikh wrote in an e-mail. The fund currently has a \u201cmodest short duration position,\u201d said Parikh, who is leaving the firm and being replaced on the fund by Marc Seidner, the new lead manager. Pimco Unconstrained gained 2.4 percent last year. Gross now runs the $1.4 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, which has lost 0.9 percent in the past three months, for Denver-based Janus Capital Group Inc. At New York-based BlackRock last year, Rieder took a different tack from his peers, buying 10-to-30-year Treasuries and municipal bonds on the assumption, which proved correct, that longer-term interest rates would fall. \u201cIt was a significant call,\u201d Rieder said. Unconstrained managers put money into investments including corporate debt, emerging market debt, residential and commercial mortgages, currencies, high-yield bonds and credit default swaps, a derivative contract used as a form of insurance against non-payment. \u201cWe have a wider tool kit in these funds,\u201d Rieder said. James F. Rothenberg isn\u2019t sure that is an advantage. Rothenberg is the chairman of Los Angeles-based Capital Group, which manages $1.1 trillion in its American Funds unit and doesn\u2019t sell an unconstrained fund. \u201cYou are asking people to do all kinds of things and get it right,\u201d Rothenberg said in an interview. \u201cHistory suggests that doesn\u2019t happen for long.\u201d Nontraditional funds are trailing intermediate funds again in 2015, as interest rates continue to fall. Intermediate funds returned an average of 0.9 percent as of Jan. 13, while flexible funds lost 0.1 percent, according to Morningstar. It still may be too early to make a valid judgment about the flexible funds, said Sarah Bush, a senior analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been around that long,\u201d Bush said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe are going to have to see how they perform through a whole cycle.\u201d","timestamp":1421290801.0,"participant_ids":["PUBAX:US","MORN:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-15\/flexible-bond-funds-flop-as-rate-drop-stings-top-sellers","subject":"Flexible Bond Funds Flop as Rate Drop Stings Top Sellers"},{"body":" One of the hottest areas for U.S. money managers is quickly cooling off. Flows into hedge fund-like mutual funds, a category that attracted almost a third of the money going into actively managed funds in the past six years, have slowed this year to the weakest pace since 2008. The strategies, which include non-traditional bond funds and alternative stock funds, attracted just $1.2 billion from investors in the first five months of 2015, according to Chicago-based  , down from $39 billion last year and a record $96 billion in 2013. The funds, whose rapid growth has prompted scrutiny from regulators, trailed last year as stocks and bonds rallied. The rapid drop in investor interest is a setback for firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co., which had counted on the fashionable strategies to win back clients into higher-fee products amid a general flight to cheaper, passive vehicles. \u201cStocks and bonds did so well last year that a lot of people asked themselves: \u2018Why do I need to own alternatives?\u2019\u201d said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston, where he helps oversee $2 billion. The prospect for such funds could improve if the stock market slumps or if interest rates go up rapidly. The initial appeal of the new funds was simple, especially for investors who lost money in traditional funds during the 2008 financial crisis. If wealthy individuals and institutions could put their money into vehicles with the flexibility to make money in all kinds of markets, why not ordinary investors? That helped long-short equity funds and absolute-return funds win deposits after 2008. Non-traditional bond funds got a boost in 2013 when interest rates shot up after the Federal Reserve hinted in May of that year that the central bank might cut back its bond-buying program. In total, these strategies attracted about $253 billion in the six years through 2014, about 29 percent of all money that flowed into active U.S. mutual funds. \u201cThe concept was sexy to a lot of people who had read about hedge fund managers making billions of dollars,\u201d said Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant based in Philadelphia. With the client cash came attention from regulators, who   whether individuals understood the risks of investing in such vehicles, known as liquid alternative funds. Examiners at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began looking into alternative funds last year for how they comply with leverage and liquidity rules, and whether their boards are appropriately overseeing their activities. SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said last week that new regulations may be needed to rein in funds that are evading the limits on their holdings of riskier investments such as derivatives and other hard-to-sell assets. The funds use such instruments in part to juice returns in adverse markets. They didn\u2019t do well last year, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index returned 14 percent, including reinvested dividends. Intermediate bond funds, the most popular fixed-income investments, gained 5.2 percent, compared with 1.2 percent for their non-traditional competitors, Morningstar data show. \u201cAlternative strategies are bound to lag when markets are going up as much as they have,\u201d said Josh Charney, a Morningstar analyst. Investors responded by pulling money out. Three of the four largest unconstrained bond funds, the $22 billion Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund, the $20 billion JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, and the $9 billion Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund, suffered redemptions in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the alternatives side, the $5.5 billion Mainstay Marketfield Fund has been the   for shifting sentiment. Investors poured money into the long-short fund in 2013 after manager Michael Aronstein consistently beat peers from 2008 to 2012. They headed for the exits after he lost 12 percent in 2014, hurt by wrong-way bets on commodity stocks. In the 12 months ended May 31, the fund experienced more than $13 billion in withdrawals, Morningstar data show. Glazer and others say individuals, known for chasing performance and timing decisions poorly, may be getting it wrong again. With interest rates finally set to increase and stocks moving sideways, investments that aren\u2019t correlated with traditional assets might be more attractive. \u201cPeople should be looking for investments that have the possibility of doing well in market environments where the expected returns are more anemic,\u201d said David Kabiller co-founder of AQR Capital Management, which manages $140 billion and runs the industry\u2019s largest alternative mutual fund. Some funds have bucked the trend. Rick Rieder\u2019s $30.7 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio beat 80 percent of non-traditional bond rivals over the past year and pulled in $14 billion in deposits. The $7.5 billion John Hancock Global Absolute Return Strategies Fund attracted $1.9 billion over the same period after producing gains every year since 2012. The fund is designed to provide positive returns with less volatility than the stock market, said Andrew Arnott, president of John Hancock Investments in Boston, where he oversees $125 billion. \u201cIf all goes well, this fund should give people a boring ride,\u201d he said. So far, 2015 has been favorable for alternative strategies amid global market volatility and slower stock-market gains. Through May, hedge fund returns, as measured by the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Hedge Fund Index, topped the gains in the S&P 500. On the bond side, non-traditional funds are doing better than their conventional counterparts, Morningstar data show. This sort of market might help get investors back in, said Kevin Quirk, one of the founding partners of Casey, Quirk & Associates LLC, a consulting firm that specializes in asset management. \u201cAlternatives will have greater appeal in a more difficult market,\u201d Quirk said.","timestamp":1434934801.0,"participant_ids":["PUBAX:US","MORN:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-22\/hedge-funds-for-masses-lose-shine-as-goldman-pimco-see-outflows","subject":"Hedge Funds for Masses Lose Shine as Goldman, Pimco See Outflows"},{"body":" Holcim Ltd. and Lafarge SA are in talks to renegotiate some terms of their merger to placate investors unhappy about a gap in performance since the cement makers agreed to a deal in April, said people familiar with the matter. The two sides are discussing changes to the 1-to-1 share-exchange ratio that would give Holcim shareholders a bigger stake in the combined company, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are not public. The boards of both companies would need to approve any adjustment and an announcement may come as early as this month, the people said. Plans to combine Holcim and Lafarge were announced to great fanfare, with the heads of both companies lauding the creation of the world\u2019s biggest cement maker with sales of $40 billion and operations in 90 countries. Since then, Holcim has   Paris-based Lafarge on everything from sales to profit, prompting some investors in the Swiss company to call for a bigger stake in the new entity. No decision has been made and the companies could also decide to keep the current terms unchanged, the people said. Holcim said in an e-mailed statement that \u201cthe state of affairs currently remains unchanged\u201d as \u201cboth companies continue to work on different workstreams to conclude the planned merger.\u201d A Lafarge spokeswoman declined to comment. The Financial Times reported the talks between the two companies to renegotiate some terms yesterday. The agreed exchange ratio is a disadvantage for Holcim shareholders, and the Swiss firm\u2019s outlook on a stand-alone basis would be better, a Swiss shareholder with about 1 percent of Holcim, who asked not to be identified publicly criticizing the deal, said last month. Eurocement Holding AG, the company\u2019s second-largest shareholder, is also concerned about the deal\u2019s structure, according to people familiar with the matter. Another option to placate shareholders is paying a special dividend, the people said. Holcim and Lafarge may also decide to make personnel changes after recent disagreements between executives from both companies, the people said. Holcim and Lafarge in December said they\u2019ll each contribute five managers to the executive board of the new company. Bruno Lafont, chief executive officer of France\u2019s Lafarge, was picked to lead a board that includes Holcim finance chief Thomas Aebischer. Some investors are critical of Lafont because of Lafarge\u2019s lagging performance, they said. Holcim\u2019s biggest shareholder, Thomas Schmidheiny, said this week that the agreed merger still makes sense, one day after a newspaper reported the deal might be in danger because he is seeking better terms. Schmidheiny, who owns about 20 percent, seeks a better exchange ratio or special dividend for Holcim shareholders, Switzerland\u2019s SonntagsZeitung reported, citing people close to the investor and a Holcim director it didn\u2019t identify. An adjustment to the merger terms is the most likely outcome after the gap between both companies\u2019 outlook widened, according to an analyst note from Sanford C. Bernstein from earlier this month. A change in the range of 10 percent to 15 percent would be a sufficient compromise, the note said. Holcim and Lafarge agreed last year to merge to combine operations after the global recession eroded demand for building materials, and as increased competition from emerging-market rivals undermined profits. The companies expect the combination to generate synergies of more than 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion). While both Holcim and Lafarge have been experiencing declining revenue and cash flow, Holcim\u2019s have had less of a slide since the deal was struck, on average. And Holcim\u2019s Ebitda margin -- or the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization it reaped on sales -- exceeded Lafarge\u2019s in the period, on average. \u201cWhile speculation continues to grow around a possible change in terms we see very little chance of the merger failing,\u201d J&E Davy analysts said in a note this week. \u201cWe expect Holcim and Lafarge will do what it takes to conclude the deal.\u201d","timestamp":1426158186.0,"participant_ids":["HOLN:VX","LG:FP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-12\/holcim-lafarge-said-to-discuss-changing-terms-for-cement-merger","subject":"Holcim, Lafarge Said to Discuss Changing Terms for Cement Merger"},{"body":" Holcim Ltd. Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, trying to overcome lingering opposition to a mega-merger with Lafarge SA, backed a board seat for the second-biggest shareholder Eurocement Holding AG and vowed to work closely with future co-chairman Bruno Lafont. Holcim and Lafarge last month agreed on new terms and management changes, including making Lafarge chief executive officer Lafont co-chairman, instead of CEO, to salvage the creation of the world\u2019s biggest cement company. Both executives now need to work together to prove to shareholders that the merger creates value, Reitzle said. \u201cWe\u2019ll both have our hands full to ensure a successful merger and we\u2019ll share the work on a daily basis,\u201d Reitzle, 66, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s all about bringing together both companies and their troops and to create a harmonious, performance culture as quickly as possible. Without Bruno Lafont, that wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d The initial merger terms and Lafont\u2019s position became a sticking point after Lafarge\u2019s results lagged its Swiss peer, highlighting the difficulties of creating a $48 billion company through a merger of equals. Even after agreeing to an exchange ratio more favorable for Holcim investors, Reitzle still faces   from some shareholders including Eurocement, the Russian cement maker controlled by billionaire Filaret Galchev, ahead of a vote in May needed to complete the deal. \u201cYou can assume that we are speaking with all shareholders and also with him,\u201d Reitzle said, referring to Galchev\u2019s Eurocement, which has a 10.8 percent stake in Holcim. When asked whether he\u2019d consider giving him a seat on the board, he said: \u201cIt would be beneficial to have him in the board as he would bring in lots of expertise from the cement sector.\u201d While Eurocement views the offer for a board seat as a positive step, it remains opposed to the merger because it\u2019s unsatisfied with the exchange ratio, according to a person familiar with the matter. Eurocement plans to vote against the merger, a person familiar with the matter said last week. The company isn\u2019t satisfied with the revised terms, which would give 0.9 of one Holcim share for one share of Lafarge, instead of the original one-for-one ratio, said the person, asking not to be identified because the considerations are private. Reitzle said no further change in the exchange ratio \u201cis foreseeable\u201d and he ruled out paying a special cash dividend now to placate investors. \u201cNaturally, everyone could imagine better terms, but I believe these terms are fair for both sides,\u201d said the former CEO of Germany\u2019s Linde AG, the world\u2019s largest industrial gas supplier. \u201cI think on the day of the vote, people will think long and hard and realize that the deal logic and potential to create value are the more convincing arguments.\u201d Two thirds of Holcim\u2019s shareholders need to approve a capital increase that is necessary for the deal to go through at an investor meeting. Lafarge\u2019s annual general meeting is on May 7, one day before the Swiss company meets. Ethos foundation, which advises Swiss pension funds, said late last month that it still has doubts about the combination and large shareholder Harris Associates told newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft that the new terms are \u201cnot perfect.\u201d Other investors such as Thomas Schmidheiny, Holcim\u2019s largest shareholder and the billionaire co-architect of the merger, support the deal. \u201cAs an investor with a long-term interest I\u2019m positive about the future value of, and I therefore fully support, the Holcim and Lafarge merger,\u201d Schmidheiny said in a statement. \u201cOnce all matters regarding the share exchange ratio and the governance have been agreed on, I will expect from the management team to focus on and implement the integration forcefully.\u201d Who will lead that team as CEO remains to be seen after Lafont was pushed out of that role. Under last month\u2019s agreement, the French company will propose a new CEO for the combined entity, which will value Lafarge at 28.2 billion euros ($30.3 billion). Lafarge favors Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Gauthier and Executive Vice-President Eric Olsen, people familiar with the matter said on March 23. Reitzle declined to comment on any potential candidates, but said he\u2019s hopes a new CEO will be presented \u201cin the next one or two weeks.\u201d Until then, the German executive will keep arguing the merits of the deal, which is in \u201ca spirit of merger of equals,\u201d and pushing the teams to realize the targeted 1.4 billion euros in savings. He didn\u2019t rule out share buybacks and special dividends once the synergies have been achieved. \u201cOur main goal is to complete the merger as quickly as possible and then work on realizing the synergies while simultaneously forging a single culture,\u201d Reitzle said. \u201cWe have large teams that haven\u2019t had vacation for a year, they worked over Christmas, day and night, to achieve this merger, while successfully managing daily operations.\u201d","timestamp":1427886621.0,"participant_ids":["HOLN:VX","2281109Z:SW","LG:FP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-01\/holcim-s-reitzle-backs-eurocement-board-seat-lafont-cooperation","subject":"Holcim\u2019s Reitzle Backs Eurocement Board Seat, Lafont Role"},{"body":" Holcim Ltd. and Lafarge SA brought their planned merger back from the brink of collapse, agreeing on new terms and management changes to pave the way for the creation of the world\u2019s biggest cement company. The companies failed to answer a contentious question -- who will lead the combined entity, which will value France\u2019s Lafarge at 28.2 billion euros ($30.2 billion). Lafarge chief Bruno Lafont, who had been designated as chief executive officer of the merged company, will now become co-chairman, after Holcim managers said in the past week they didn\u2019t want him as CEO. The tensions underscore the difficulties of bringing together two companies in what was announced almost a year ago as a merger of equals. The terms and management lineup became a sticking point after Lafarge\u2019s results lagged its Swiss peer. The terms are now more favorable for Holcim investors, who will pay less in stock for Lafarge. A merger of such a size \u201cdoesn\u2019t come without tension sometimes,\u201d Lafont told reporters on a call today. \u201cMy attitude since Sunday is to show that men must not block the implementation of this merger.\u201d Lafont will now become co-chairman of the new entity alongside Holcim Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle. Holcim will pay 0.90 of a share in return for one share of Paris-based Lafarge, instead of the original one-to-one ratio, valuing Lafarge at about 65.40 euros a share. The combined company will have a market value of about 47 billion Swiss francs ($47.6 billion) based on today\u2019s price for Holcim stock and the number of shares that will be outstanding after the transaction closes. Lafarge rose 2.1 percent to 63.62 euros in Paris, while Holcim shares gained 0.5 percent in Zurich. Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Phil Roseberg said it\u2019s not certain whether the new agreement will rescue the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the story,\u201d he said in a note. \u201cThe fate of the merger still rests with Holcim\u2019s shareholders. The boards have secured an adjustment, but is this enough to convince shareholders?\u201d For the merger to go through, at least two-thirds of Holcim shareholders still must approve a capital increase. Holcim, in a letter to the French company on Sunday, had demanded a bigger stake and questioned the ability of Lafont to reach savings targets after its business outperformed Lafarge since the deal to create the world\u2019s biggest cement maker was announced in April. Lafont and Holcim managers also clashed over issues including leadership style and strategy, people familiar with the situation have said. A new CEO will be proposed to both boards in coming weeks, Lafont said. A Lafarge candidate for CEO has been identified, according to people familiar with the matter. Beat Hess, a high-profile Swiss executive and board director at Holcim, will be vice-chairman. The French government said today it\u2019s monitoring the transaction to make sure certain decision-making aspects stay in France. France wouldn\u2019t welcome Lafarge being absorbed by Holcim, said a spokeswoman for the French economy ministry. Holcim and Lafarge have predicted the merger will lead to cost savings of 1.4 billion euros annually, giving them an advantage over rivals as a global recession eroded demand for building materials and forced some kilns to run at a loss. The decision to create a cement giant pushes the boundaries of M&A in an industry that had already seen heady, debt-fueled acquisitions in the run up to the financial crisis in 2008. Following the initial agreement last year, Holcim came under pressure from investors who increasingly saw the terms of the deal as unfavorable to them. \u201cThe breakthrough was only possible because all participants considered the interests of the new company to be more important than personal ambitions,\u201d Holcim\u2019s biggest shareholder, Thomas Schmidheiny, said in a statement, adding that he\u2019s happy with the outcome. \u201cIt is a strong sign that the industrial logic of the merger and the related long-term perspectives succeeded.\u201d The deal, with the renewed suppport of \u201ccertain key shareholders of both companies\u201d should be completed in July, the cement makers said. Subject to shareholder approval, the new company will announce a \u201cpost-closing scrip dividend\u201d of one new Lafarge-Holcim share for each 20 existing shares. Holcim was advised by Perella Weinberg Partners, led by Dietrich Becker, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., headed up by Francois-Xavier de Mallmann. Lafarge worked with Zaoui & Co., led by co-founder Michael Zaoui, and Rothschild, with bankers Francois Wat and Gregoire Heuze. Other banks were involved when the transaction was first announced. The dispute over leadership by the 58-year-old Frenchman Lafont shows how a clash of personalities can become the biggest liability in mergers. The gum-chewing, cigar smoking Lafont and soft-spoken Holcim CEO Bernard Fontana, who was due to remain in his post until the merger completion, have disagreed on key issues from the start, a person familiar with the matter said earlier this week. \u201cA face saving position has been found for Mr. Lafont, but the boards couldn\u2019t find a new CEO within the ranks of Lafarge,\u201d said Sanford C.

The companies are set to announce the appointment as early as Thursday, the person said. The companies needed to find a CEO candidate after Holcim demanded changes to an initial agreement that would have had installed Lafarge chief Bruno Lafont as head of the new entity. Holcim questioned the ability of the French executive to reach savings targets after Lafarge\u2019s results trailed those of its Swiss merger partner. Olsen, who has both French and U.S. nationality, joined Lafarge in 1999. The executive, who started his career at consulting firm Deloitte & Touche, holds a degree in finance and accounting from the University of Colorado and an MBA from the   in Paris.

It may take sweetened terms or cash to keep them happy. Since announcing the combination in April to create the world\u2019s biggest cement maker with about $40 billion in sales, Swiss firm Holcim has outperformed its French partner Lafarge, on average, in sales performance, profit and cash from operations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap between the two companies is fueling concern about the deal\u2019s structure among Holcim investors including Eurocement Holding AG, the company\u2019s second-largest shareholder, according to people familiar with the matter. Pressure is rising for Holcim to renegotiate the 1:1 share-exchange ratio, pay out cash to investors or even reconsider the deal as a whole, the people said. \u201cHolcim shows a better operational performance than Lafarge since the proposed merger was announced,\u201d said Rocchino Contangelo, a fund manager at Zurich-based Swisscanto, which owns shares in Holcim. \u201cSome investors think that this better operational performance should be reflected in the terms of the deal.\u201d Contangelo said his firm hasn\u2019t decided if it will back the merger. The exchange ratio is a disadvantage for Holcim shareholders, and the Swiss firm\u2019s outlook on a stand-alone basis would be better, according to a Swiss shareholder with about 1 percent of Holcim, who asked not to be identified publicly criticizing the deal. Shares of Lafarge fell 2.5 percent to 64.66 euros at 12:38 p.m. in Paris today. Holcim was up 0.6 percent at 74 francs in Zurich. The premium at which Holcim shares trade over Lafarge\u2019s rose to the highest since the merger was announced. \u201cThe market is starting to price in the probability of a re-adjustment in the terms of the merger,\u201d even though the probability of such a move is \u201cquite low,\u201d said Phil Roseberg, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cThis was inevitable given the amount of noise that is now circulating around. It\u2019s a poker game now.\u201d To placate shareholders, Holcim and Lafarge are considering paying a special dividend after agreeing to sell   to CRH Plc for 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to address antitrust hurdles, according to two people familiar with the discussions. For the merger to go through under its current terms, at least two-thirds of Holcim shareholders still must approve a capital increase. They\u2019ll vote on it at an extraordinary meeting that\u2019s expected to be held in the first half after the company\u2019s annual meeting due April 13. \u201cLafarge shareholders, given the downside risk if the deal falls apart, I think would far rather seek a compromise,\u201d Roseberg said. \u201cLafarge-Holcim management have a duty to ensure that there is a predictable outcome going into the shareholder vote.\u201d Lafarge Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont said on Feb. 18 that the merged companies would aim to boost returns to shareholders rather than make new acquisitions. Eurocement, which is owned by Georgia-born Filaret Galchev and holds a 10.8 percent stake in Holcim, is also reviewing the terms of the deal amid shareholder concern and plans to communicate its stance in the coming weeks, according to two people. Other smaller shareholders are also pushing for a change in the exchange ratio or a special payment, they said. Peter Stopfe, a spokesman for Jona, Switzerland-based Holcim, said \u201cthe state of affairs remains unchanged\u201d and that there\u2019s no mechanism to automatically adjust the exchange ratio. He said the company will meet \u201call relevant shareholders\u201d during investor roadshows. Christel des Royeries, a spokeswoman for Paris-based Lafarge, referenced comments from CEO Lafont, who said the exchange ratio is \u201cset by contract, and reflects long-term prospects of the two companies.\u201d Representatives for Eurocement didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment sent by phone and e-mail. The agreed breakup fee of 350 million euros would be annulled if Holcim shareholders vote down the transaction, according to a person familiar with the matter. Holcim and Lafarge agreed to merge last year to unite operations after the global recession eroded demand for building materials, and as increased competition from emerging-market rivals undermined profits. The companies expect the combination to generate synergies of more than 1.4 billion euros. While both Holcim and Lafarge have been experiencing declining revenue and cash flow, Holcim\u2019s have had less of a slide since the deal was struck, on average. And Holcim\u2019s Ebitda margin -- or the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization it reaped on sales -- exceeded Lafarge\u2019s in the period, on average. That said, Lafarge led Holcim by that measure during the six quarters before the deal was announced. \u201cHolcim\u2019s fourth-quarter publication was good, Lafarge\u2019s less so,\u201d Gaetan Dupont, an analyst at AlphaValue in Paris, said in an e-mailed response to questions. Still, \u201cthe track records of Lafarge and Holcim in the past two to four years clearly show that Lafarge has been rather better managed than Holcim, so it seems very unlikely that the deal is detrimental to either of the companies.\u201d Even so, Holcim\u2019s valuation has come under pressure. Before the two agreed to combine, they had roughly the same ratio of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Now, Holcim trades for just 9.7 times Ebitda, a 27 percent discount to Lafarge\u2019s multiple, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Holcim\u2019s valuation may be down in part because its shareholders see less to gain in a deal. The stock was also among a group of Swiss equities that took a hit this year after the nation\u2019s central bank allowed its currency to appreciate. The company\u2019s stock prices reflect some expectations that the merger terms may be adjusted in Holcim\u2019s favor, though only a small probability, according to a Feb. 26 note by Patrick Appenzeller, an analyst at Baader-Helvea in Zurich. \u201cWe believe that the probability is much higher, based on the changed fundamental outlook for the companies,\u201d Appenzeller wrote. He recommends that investors sell Lafarge shares and buy Holcim\u2019s. \u201cWhy should Holcim investors agree to such a bad deal?\u201d","timestamp":1425290627.0,"participant_ids":["HOLN:VX","LG:FP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-28\/holcim-may-need-sweetener-to-cement-lafarge-merger-real-m-a","subject":"Holcim May Need Sweetener to Cement Lafarge Merger"},{"body":" Holcim Ltd.\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, Eurocement Holding AG, plans to vote against the Swiss company\u2019s merger with Lafarge SA, even after the cement makers last week agreed on new terms and management changes to placate investors, said a person familiar with the matter.

Lafarge Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Gauthier and Executive Vice-President Eric Olsen are favored by the French company to become chief executive officer of LafargeHolcim, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak in public. The companies need to find a new CEO after Holcim earlier this month demanded to change an initial agreement that would have installed Lafarge chief Bruno Lafont as head of the $48 billion company. Holcim had questioned the ability of the French executive to reach savings targets after Lafarge\u2019s results lagged its Swiss peer. Lafont and Holcim managers also clashed over issues including leadership style and strategy. The companies agreed on March 20 to make Lafont co-chairman of LafargeHolcim along with Holcim Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle and give the Swiss company a bigger stake in the new entity, leaving open the contentious question of who will be CEO of the world\u2019s biggest cement company. Olsen, who has both French and U.S. nationality, joined Lafarge in 1999 and was in charge of organization and human resources in 2007 before becoming executive vice president of operations in 2013. The executive, who started his career at consultancy Deloitte & Touche, holds a degree in finance and accounting from the University of Colorado and an MBA from the   in Paris. Gauthier, a graduate in law and economics, started at audit firm Arthur Young and joined Lafarge in 2001.

Indonesia\u2019s Jakarta Composite Index has jumped 12 percent since slumping to a two-year low last month, while the benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index has rallied 2.9 percent after seven straight months of losses through September. The revival in investor appetite underscores confidence that the region\u2019s $2.57 trillion economies are well placed to weather a slowdown in China\u2019s export demand after August\u2019s surprise yuan devaluation sent stock markets tumbling. Foreign investors are returning after pulling a record $5.1 billion from Thai, Philippine and Indonesian shares in the three months through September, lured by cheaper valuations and economic growth that\u2019s forecast to outpace the global average in the next two years. \u201cWe are beginning to see selective opportunities in Asean markets after the recent correction,\u201d Andrew Swan, the Hong Kong-based head of Asian equities at BlackRock, which oversees about $4.5 trillion, wrote in an e-mail last week. \u201cValuations are more attractive now, although not yet at what we would regard as crisis levels.\u201d The MSCI Southeast Asia Index rose 0.4 percent to 695.18 at 9:47 a.m. in Singapore, poised for its first gain in five days.

Erste, Austria\u2019s biggest bank, reported fourth-quarter net income of 42 million euros ($47 million) on Friday, compared with a 370-million-euro loss a year earlier, bringing the full-year loss to 1.44 billion euros. Erste won\u2019t pay a dividend for 2014 because of the record loss it posted that year. Regional and global regulators are all making demands on bank capital, the CEO said, citing the possibility of an Austrian systemic risk buffer as a further requirement that will need to be met by lenders. \u201cThere are still a lot of regulatory restrictions being discussed on the ability of banks to pay out dividends, and they are still ongoing,\u201d Treichl said. \u201cWill the ability be linked only to actual capital ratios, or to threat scenarios?

Austria\u2019s Raiffeisen Bank International AG has begun court proceedings in the \u00a0British Virgin Islands in a bid to liquidate Asia Coal Energy Ventures Ltd., Berau Coal\u2019s 85 percent owner, arguing that the investment vehicle reneged on a $120 million loan-purchase signed in May. ACE, 100 percent funded by\u00a0Indonesia\u2019s Sinarmas group, paid $50 million and withheld the rest because some collateral for the facility is missing, according to its court statements. The case was heard on Sept. 16 and Justice Barry Leon reserved his decision. A decision in Raiffeisen Bank\u2019s favor threatens to derail a debt restructuring that Berau Coal signed with a majority of bondholders in July involving $950 million of notes,\u00a0according to independent research firm CreditSights Inc. Berau Coal failed to repay $450 million of U.S. currency debentures that month in Indonesia\u2019s biggest default this year. Sinarmas\u2019s ACE defeated British banking scion Nathaniel Rothschild in July in a takeover battle for a U.K. company whose main asset was Berau Coal. \u201cThe legal dispute may make Berau bondholders more nervous about Sinarmas\u2019 willingness to pay,\u201d said Sandra Chow, a Singapore-based high-yield analyst at CreditSights. \u201cThe Berau restructuring, which looked like it was proceeding to plan a few months ago, now looks in jeopardy.\u201d ACE paid Raiffeisen Bank $50 million earlier this year to acquire soured loans whose collateral included, among other things, a 23.8 percent stake in London-based Asia Resource Minerals Plc, according to a Sept. 8 affidavit filed by ACE\u2019s ultimate director Kin Chan in response to a suit from the lender.\u00a0That was a crucial part of Sinarmas\u2019s successful takeover. The other 15 percent of Berau Coal\u2019s equity is owned by smaller shareholders, including mutual funds and individuals. The loans\u2019 other collateral included various vessels, some shares in the shipyard that built the boats, and some plots of land. Raiffeisen Bank itself came to be in possession of the bad debt and its collateral after Indonesian businessman Samin Tan defaulted on it in October 2014. According to Chan\u2019s affidavit, Raiffeisen Bank doesn\u2019t have proper documentation for 15 out of 57 tugboats and barges valued at about $1 million each, as well as ownership certificates to three out of five plots of land in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo. Chan asserted that 10 of the boats are missing. Michael Lehotzki, a Vienna-based spokesman for Raiffeisen Bank, declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. Ari Effendi, the Jakarta-based general manager of legal affairs at Berau Coal, said the dispute doesn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s operations, He also said Berau is still in discussions with its creditors regarding debt restructuring terms. Fuganto Widjaja, the grandson who oversees the Sinarmas group\u2019s coal businesses, declined to comment, according to his public relations consultants Citigate Dewe Rogerson. Sinarmas is controlled by Eka Tjipta Widjaja, ranked the fourth richest person in Indonesia with a net worth of $4.9 billion according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index. The family\u2019s Asia Pulp & Paper Co. unit buckled during the Asian financial crisis with some $14 billion of debt in what still ranks as the region\u2019s biggest-ever default. Berau Coal\u2019s 7.25 percent notes that mature in March 2017 are trading at 36.36 cents on the dollar versus 70.5 cents a year ago. Its 12.5 percent notes are at 36.90 cents. Coal prices in general have tumbled 54 percent in the four years through 2014. Berau Coal\u2019s restructuring plan involves repaying a portion of the bonds due and swapping the rest into new securities. Oscar Luppi, who oversees a private family fund in Geneva and owns Berau Coal\u2019s 2015 notes, said the whole saga had dented his confidence in Indonesia. \u201cI can tell you that we\u2019ve dramatically reduced all exposure to emerging and Asian markets for exactly these reasons,\u201d Luppi said. \u201cLack of transparency is something we\u2019ve grown to expect but I can tell you that the actual credibility of the market and its participants has been eroded significantly in the last few years.\u201d","timestamp":1442958905.0,"participant_ids":["BRAU:IJ","RBI:AV"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-23\/berau-debt-workout-clouded-by-loan-dispute-in-caribbean-court","subject":"Berau Debt Workout Clouded by Caribbean Court Loan Dispute"},{"body":"Finally, there may be some relief for emerging-market investors. Strategists at banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Bank of America Corp. say that developing-nation assets are bottoming out following three years of losses in currencies and stocks. It\u2019s not that they are likely to embark on a rally. Rather, that the mood among investors has become so depressed, even a marginal improvement in the economic outlook will be enough to shift sentiment and drive up assets such as the Mexican peso, Russian ruble bonds and Indian stocks, the analysts say. \u2019\u2018We are a little bit more optimistic next year,\u201d said Geoffrey Dennis, head of global emerging-market strategy at UBS Securities LLC in Boston, who favors Chinese, Indian and Russian equities. \u201cYou get a slightly better earnings story and overall a slight pickup in economic growth in emerging markets next year. This year\u2019s been so dreadful.\u201d After five years in retreat, developing countries from Mexico and Poland are showing signs of recovery as the U.S. and European economies pick up. While the almost 30 percent decline in emerging-market currencies since 2012 saddled investors with losses, it also helped some nations such as Brazil, Turkey and India to tackle their economic vulnerabilities, narrowing current-account deficits and boosting competitivity. Developing markets look inexpensive by historical standards. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has declined 30 percent since its 2011 high and now trades at about 12 times estimated earnings, or almost one-third less than the valuation of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, the benchmark for U.S. stocks. The developing-nation gauge was 0.2 percent lower at 2:49 p.m. in Hong Kong. On average, emerging-market currencies are 16 percent below their fair values against the dollar as the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira declined to record lows this year, according to Bank of America\u2019s model. Even though prices will remain volatile as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade, Bank of America\u2019s strategists say they are \u201cconstructive\u201d on emerging-market currencies in the \u201cmedium term.\u201d They are \u201chighly undervalued\u201d and \u201cexports and direct investment have room to rebound,\u201d analysts led by Alberto Ades in New York wrote in a research note on Nov. 19. They recommend clients buy the Mexican peso and the Polish zloty against the euro and favor local-currency bonds in Hungary and India. While acknowledging the expansion will remain below the long-term trend, Goldman Sachs forecasts that developing economies will grow 4.9 percent next year, up from an estimated 4.4 percent in 2015, the first acceleration since 2010. \u201c2016 could be the year emerging-market assets put in a bottom and start to find their feet,\u201d strategists led by London-based Kamakshya Trivedi wrote in a Nov 19 report. \u201cThere is the prospect of improved growth and better returns, even if it is not a rerun of the roaring 2000s.\u201d Goldman Sachs is advising clients to buy the  There\u2019s no shortage of pitfalls to challenge these more sanguine views on emerging markets. Aggressive interest rate increases in the U.S. could make it more difficult for companies in developing countries to pay back their $1.4 trillion of dollar debt. Barclays Plc estimates the default rate among junk-rated emerging-market companies is set to rise to as high as 7 percent next year, from 3.8 percent in 2015 and a 20-year average of about 4 percent. In China, the economy is reeling from overproduction and a debt overhang. A record high yuan against its trading partners looks increasingly at odds with a slowing economy, putting pressure on the government to weaken the currency and risking a string of competitive devaluations in the region. The mainland stock crash earlier this year shows policy makers are prone to mistakes as they juggle the conflicting tasks of supporting growth and deepening reforms. \u201cIt is far too early to expect a significant turnaround\u201d in emerging economies, Barclays analysts wrote in a note on Nov. 13. There will still be pockets of opportunity as growth stabilizes in emerging markets, according to Ruchir Sharma, the head of emerging markets for Morgan Stanley Investment Management, who says the key is differentiation. \u201cLast decade everything in emerging markets was doing well,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cWe had this incredible boom across the market. Now, it\u2019s back to country investing.

Companies backed by 91-year-old Eka Tjipta Widjaja, Indonesia\u2019s fourth-richest person, received orders twice the size of two bond issues last week at yields below the average of Asian junk-rated peers. Developer PT Bumi Serpong Damai raised $225 million from a debut sale of U.S. dollar notes. Golden Agri-Resources Ltd., the world\u2019s second-largest palm-oil producer, issued S$125 million ($94 million) in its third sale in a year. The family is also preparing a bid for an Indonesian coal producer in the midst of a dollar-debt restructuring. Fourteen years after Widjaja\u2019s sprawling Sinarmas empire was pummeled by a $14 billion default by its Asia Pulp & Paper business, investors are showing faith in its credit. The combined market value of 12 family-controlled companies listed on the Singapore and Jakarta exchanges has held steady at about $15 billion over the past year. Moody\u2019s Investors Service this month rated Bumi Serpong at Ba3, the third-highest junk grade, citing the developer\u2019s healthy finances. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be new investors keen to try their luck with the group even after the Asia Pulp & Paper debacle,\u201d Charles Macgregor, head of Asia high-yield research in Singapore at Lucror Analytics, said by phone on April 23. \u201cThey will probably come back every now and then to re-establish their position in the debt market through some of their better businesses.\u201d Asia Pulp & Paper halted payments on a total $13.9 billion of bonds, loans and trade payables in 2001, after a 20 percent plunge in global paper prices over three months. That included about $6.7 billion of dollar notes, the biggest missed bond obligation by an Asian company to date, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The firm became mired in legal challenges as Indonesian courts canceled debts and creditors lost millions. Founded in 1972, the pulp and paper business controlled by the Sinarmas Group embarked on a global fundraising drive that included a 1995 U.S. share sale. Its failure came in the wake of the Asian debt crisis, when companies across the region defaulted on billions of dollars of liabilities and Indonesia was one of three countries forced to seek an International Monetary Fund bailout. \u201cAll the corporate groups in Indonesia were suffering, especially during the 1998 Asian crisis, and Asia Pulp & Paper had tried to continue to service its debt right until we really had to give up in 2001 because of the deteriorating macro situation in the country,\u201d Gandi Sulistiyanto, Sinarmas\u2019s managing director in Jakarta, said by phone Monday. \u201cOur group is responsible with its debt despite the bad, difficult past.\u201d Bumi Serpong\u2019s April 2020 dollar bonds traded at 100.497 cents as of 9:48 a.m. on Tuesday in Hong Kong to yield 6.631 percent, Bloomberg-compiled prices show. The notes, rated BB- by Fitch, were sold at par last week to yield 6.75 percent, compared with 7.34 percent for similar-rated bonds in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index. The yield on Golden Agri\u2019s unrated 2018 notes had fallen to 4.955 percent on Monday from the 5.5 percent they priced at. The Widjajas aren\u2019t alone in debt comebacks. Other Indonesian companies have had financial troubles and then successfully returned to the dollar bond market. Property firm PT Kawasan Industri Jababeka, which reorganized debt in 2002, is selling more of its 2019 notes as early as Tuesday. PT Gajah Tunggal, the nation\u2019s biggest tire-maker, issued $500 million of five-year notes in 2013, four years after a distressed bond exchange. Developer PT Pakuwon Jati restructured global notes in 2005 and went on to raise $200 million last year. The Widjaja family trust owns 65.6 percent of Sinarmas Land Ltd., which in turns owns 51.5 percent of Bumi Serpong, the developer of a planned community in the greater Jakarta area, according to the companies\u2019 latest annual reports. The trust   49.95 percent of Golden Agri. \u201cThe controlling shareholders and family\u2019s willingness to serve debts is extremely important for emerging-markets investors,\u201d said Mark Yu, a money manager and analyst at Atlanta-based Invesco Advisers Inc., which oversees $798 billion in assets. \u201cImprovement in corporate governance and transparency definitely helps rebuild a track record. But regaining confidence from capital markets takes time and efforts to materialize.\u201d The latest Bumi Serpong notes were issued by an offshore special-purpose vehicle, similar to a structure that the Widjaja family has previously challenged in local courts, Lucror Analytics said in an April 20 report. Almost 90 percent of all Indonesian private corporate dollar notes have been issued via offshore entities. \u201cInvestors have to be mindful of the restructuring history of Indonesian corporates, especially given that many of them have had several reschedulings or restructurings in the past,\u201d said Brigitte Posch, head of emerging market corporate debt at Babson Capital Management, which manages $217 billion in assets. \u201cInvestors also need to be familiar with the Indonesian insolvency framework, as it is not the most creditor friendly regime.\u201d The cost to insure Indonesia\u2019s sovereign debt against nonpayment using credit-default swaps is little changed this year at about 161 basis points, according to data provider CMA. The rupiah has weakened 4.6 percent against the dollar, making it Asia\u2019s second-worst performing major currency. The nation\u2019s companies have defaulted on $2.3 billion of U.S. dollar bonds since 2008, the most among regional corporates, according to Bloomberg data. Three units of coal miner PT Bumi Resources sought creditor protection in the U.S. in December after missing some payments on   of bonds, while PT Bakrie Telecom faced lawsuits from foreign investors in its  . Sinarmas is also committing as much as $300 million to a   bid for London-listed Asia Resource Minerals, which owns 85 percent of Indonesia\u2019s fifth-largest coal miner PT Berau Coal Energy. If successful, the group may inject the Berau assets into its Singapore-listed Golden Energy & Resources Ltd. unit, according to an April 15 exchange filing. The turnaround in Widjaja\u2019s fortunes is splitting money managers who often reference the group\u2019s history as a cautionary tale in emerging-market investing after the noteholder losses following Asia Pulp\u2019s default. Hal Hirsch, a managing director at New York-based Alvarez & Marsal Inc., which specializes in debt recoveries and is advising some of Bakrie Telecom\u2019s bondholders, said that Indonesia can be \u201ca dangerous corporate labyrinth for investors and regulators\u201d due to a lack of transparency. \u201cHistory repeats and provides lessons -- even in finance,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1430139601.0,"participant_ids":["BSDE:IJ","GGR:SP","AFP:SP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-27\/worst-asian-default-forgiven-as-indonesia-billionaire-sells-debt","subject":"Worst Asian Default Forgiven as Indonesia Billionaire Sells Debt"},{"body":" Who\u2019s in charge here? That\u2019s just one of the questions an Indonesian coal mining company seeking to avoid a July dollar bond default is having trouble answering. PT Berau Coal Energy has issued statements in the past month that were denied by its London-based parent Asia Resource Minerals Plc. This week, an ARMS shareholder meeting to approve a recapitalization of Berau by U.K. banking scion Nathaniel Rothschild was adjourned. Indonesian billionaire Eka Tjipta Widjaja is seeking to buy ARMS, unions are campaigning for a local manager and workers have held a strike. The tangle of conflicting corporate statements threatens the restructuring of $450 million of notes due in July. The miner may default without a restructuring agreement and any indications foreign investors are being discriminated against may undermine the ability of Indonesian President Joko Widodo to attract global funds, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cIt could be a test for Indonesia of what happens to foreign-owned companies,\u201d said Xavier Jean, a director of corporate ratings at S&P in Singapore. \u201cThe current headlines and fluid situation will just make the refinancing and the restructuring of the bonds more complicated.\u201d A spokesman at Rothschild\u2019s NR Holdings Ltd. said by e-mail he didn\u2019t expect Berau to default as it considers rival bids from Russia-based SUEK Plc and Widjaja\u2019s Asia Coal Energy. \u201cBerau has paid all coupons to date and can now agree a solution with bond holders that pushes the July 8 maturity back by six to 12 months giving the company breathing room to evaluate all options from NR Holdings\/SUEK, ACE, as well maintaining the existing NR Holdings recapitalization plan, in the likely event the ACE offer falls away,\u201d he said. Fuganto Widjaja, chief executive officer of Sinarmas\u2019s Golden Energy & Resources Ltd., said his group\u2019s bid is the best chance for Berau to recover and pay its debts. He is the grandson of Eka Tjipta, 91. \u201cTogether, Golden Energy & Resources and Berau are expected to rank among the top three coal companies in Indonesia in terms of reserves,\u201d Widjaja said in a May 13 e-mail. The two could create \u201ca large and crucial supplier of coal to meet Indonesia\u2019s electric generation needs.\u201d The history of the spat stretches back to 2010 when ARMS -- then called   -- agreed to acquire a stake in PT Bumi Resources from Indonesia\u2019s Bakrie family, in a deal valued at $3 billion. The Bakries pulled out of the venture last year by buying Bumi, the company\u2019s namesake mine, for  . After the breakup, the London-listed company\u2019s name was changed from Bumi Plc to ARMS. Its main asset was Berau and its coal concession over   of seam-rich land, almost half the size of the state of Rhode Island. Control of ARMS remained in the hands of an Indonesian, Samin Tan, who also controls coal producer PT Borneo Lumbung Energi & Metal. A   by Tan in October gave Rothschild the upper hand, if only for a short time. This month, Sinarmas Group, founded by Widjaja, launched a takeover bid for ARMS. Both Rothschild\u2019s NR Holdings Ltd. and Widjaja\u2019s Sinarmas have outlined Berau recapitalization plans. Creditors and shareholders have to choose which to approve and then vote on it before the July 8 bond repayment deadline. Berau\u2019s 12.5 percent notes, rated Caa1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, are trading at 56.942 cents to the dollar, after plunging almost 15 cents in April. The company has posted losses in four successive quarters through Sept. 30, as coal prices dropped 28 percent last year. \u201cIt is a complex situation given the bidding war,\u201d said Brian Grieser, an analyst at Moody\u2019s in Singapore. Uncertainty over ownership at ARMS and leadership at Berau \u201care making restructuring efforts very challenging.\u201d Indonesian companies have defaulted on $2.3 billion of U.S. dollar bonds since 2008, the most among regional corporates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The two most recent non-payments, Bumi Resources and PT Bakrie Telecom, were related to the Bakrie family. Widjaja\u2019s empire was involved in Asia\u2019s biggest-ever default when subsidiary Asia Pulp & Paper Co. reneged in 2001 on about $13.9 billion of debt. Who\u2019s in Charge? Leadership at Berau is in flux. On March 25, Hamish Tyrwhitt, former CEO of Australia\u2019s Leighton Holdings Ltd., was appointed to replace an Indonesian, Amir Sambodo, who resigned as President Director of Berau and CEO of ARMS that day, company filings show. On April 30, a majority of Berau shareholders nominated an Indonesian, Iskak Indra Wahyudi, as Berau President-Director. Tyrwhitt is still the CEO of ARMS. Singgih Widagdo, a Jakarta-based spokesman for Berau, said by phone May 12 Sambodo remains the president director of Berau, considering Indonesia\u2019s Financial Services Authority didn\u2019t ratify the results of the April 30 vote. Conflicting messages prompted the stock exchange to suspend Berau on May 4. Widagdo also said some of Berau\u2019s general managers had agreed to work under Sambodo, who signed the company\u2019s recent filing to the Jakarta Stock Exchange dated May 4. Ito Warsito, the exchange\u2019s president director, said by phone May 12 he had sent a letter seeking an explanation from Berau but there had been no reply. Sean Wade, a spokesman for ARMS in London, said via e-mail May 13 Sambodo isn\u2019t the CEO of Berau because the April 30 meeting was \u201cconducted in good order.\u201d ARMS said in a May 5 filing that Sambodo had issued \u201cmisleading announcements\u201d on behalf of Berau. According to a filing signed by Ari Ahmad Effendi, Berau\u2019s head of legal, the appointment of two ARMS directors -- Keith John Downham and Paul Jeremy Martin Fenby -- as directors of Berau was canceled last month because they didn\u2019t have valid work permits for Indonesia. According to Wade, media reports on that issue are \u201cincorrect.\u201d On April 29, workers at Berau\u2019s mine held a strike for a few hours,   an Indonesian boss. Berau Coal Union Chairman M Lukman Rahim said by phone on May 12 that Berau needs local leadership and ownership. \u201cProduction and activity in the middle of the management conflict is still on going normal,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, the role of foreigners is too large. For operations, if we want to buy some equipment, we need to get approval from London, and that takes time. I hope ARMS will divest their share.\u201d Bambang Tjahjono, director of development and utilization of coal for the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources   Bisnis Indonesia on May 6 Berau\u2019s license to operate mines may be suspended should foreign ownership not be reduced. While there is nothing yet to suggest the government will intervene, coal is of national interest, said Nancy Koh, a credit analyst at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell who is the company president at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cThis boardroom tussle has been totally unproductive and diverting attention from real work as the July bond time bomb is ticking.\u201d","timestamp":1431608401.0,"participant_ids":["BRAU:IJ","BUMI:IJ"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-14\/who-s-in-charge-berau-web-thickens-as-indonesian-default-nears","subject":"Who\u2019s in Charge?

Sinar Mas, controlled by Indonesian plantation billionaire Eka Tjipta Widjaja, said undisclosed parties may be planning to initiate a legal process to destabilize and destroy its effort to restructure $950 million of bonds owed by PT Berau Coal Energy. That could include a potential bankruptcy or   under local laws, according to a regulatory filing late Tuesday. The Widjaja family, via its takeover vehicle Asia Coal Energy Ventures Ltd. or ACE, said it has every intention to work with bondholders, ARMS and its creditors \u201cto defeat any such hostile actions\u201d and protect its plan to reorganize Berau\u2019s debt, according to the filing. ARMS owns 84.7 percent of Berau, Indonesia\u2019s fifth-largest coal producer. Singgih Widagdo, a Berau spokesman in Jakarta, said he didn\u2019t know of any legal measures being taken against the company, in a text message on Wednesday. ACE is offering 98.8 million pounds ($152 million) to acquire ARMS and has said it will commit another $150 million in new equity to recapitalize the miner. While U.K. banking scion Nathaniel Rothschild, an ARMS shareholder, also proposed a recapitalization plan of his own, he has since ditched an attempt to bid for the company. Indonesia\u2019s court-supervised debt moratorium and restructuring process, known by the local acronym of PKPU, is part of the Southeast Asian country\u2019s   that was revised in 2004. It may be initiated by either the debtor or creditor and make take as long as 270 days from the initial suspension of debt payment obligations. \u201cThe PKPU process is typically time-consuming,\u201d Annisa Lee, a credit analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in an interview in Singapore. \u201cGoing by history, the outcome generally tends to be less friendly to offshore investors in terms of recovery value than in non-PKPU cases.\u201d Sinar Mas also, in the June 2 regulatory filing, said it had published an open letter to Berau\u2019s contractors and working capital providers, promising to work in good faith with them. \u201cWe respectfully ask that all contractors and working capital providers to Berau continue to work in harmony with Berau in ensuring that the business is run in as stable and normal a way as is possible,\u201d the letter, which was enclosed in the regulatory filing, said. \u201cWe believe any difficulties that are now being faced are temporary and that the long term future of Berau is bright for all legitimate stakeholders.\u201d Berau has $450 million of 12.5 percent notes that mature on July 8 and $500 million of 7.25 percent debentures due in March 2017. The Widjaja family last week won an in-principle agreement from some Berau noteholders to extend the maturities to avoid a default next month. Under that agreement, the bonds would now come due in July 2019 and December 2020 respectively, and their coupon would be reduced. The 12.5 percent notes, sold to investors at 100 cents on the dollar in June 2010, traded at 62.512 cents as of 2:03 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.

Actually, there\u2019s plenty of coal, just not enough trains to get it to the power plants. While about 200 railway convoys arrive every day at Coal India Ltd.\u2019s depots, Technical Director Nagendra Kumar said the company needs 230 of them. The state-run company supplies more than 80 percent of the nation\u2019s coal. India will need to upgrade its railway network for Coal India to open more mines and deliver its product, said Deven Choksey, managing director at KR Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt., a Mumbai-based brokerage. \u201cThe infrastructure bottlenecks are stopping Coal India from rising to its full potential,\u201d Choksey said. Coal generates about 60 percent of India\u2019s electricity. With output climbing at Coal India, the fuel is piling up at the mines. At the same time, slumping global prices mean customers are turning to imports from the likes of Glencore Plc, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Indonesia\u2019s PT Bumi Resources. Benchmark thermal coal prices have slipped to near a six-year low, and prices are down by more than half since peaking in January 2011. That\u2019s making imported coal more affordable. India\u2019s coal imports jumped 33.5 percent to 242.4 million metric tons in the year ended March 31, according to data from Mjunction Services Ltd., a Kolkata, India-based auction platform for commodities. The figure may reach 260 million tons this year, Mjunction Chief Executive Officer Viresh Oberoi said in an e-mailed response to questions. BHP ended Sydney trading on Monday at A$33.35, up 2.6 percent, while Bumi Resources gained 4.2 percent to 75 rupiah in Jakarta. Coal India shares rose 1.9 percent to 369.80 rupees at the close in Mumbai. The stock has declined 3.7 percent this year, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has been little changed. Power plants near ports often bring in imports by truck, unable to find enough railway cars. \u201cCoal prices having fallen internationally will benefit some of the coastal plants,\u201d said  , partner, infrastructure and government services, at KPMG. \u201cImported coal may have become cheaper than domestic coal for some consumers.\u201d That\u2019s affecting Coal India. The company\u2019s sales volume has lagged behind production in each of the past six months according to filings, an unusual pattern for a company that isn\u2019t meeting demand. Dependence on coal imports is unjustified, as India has \u201chuge\u201d reserves of the fuel, Piyush Goyal, minister for coal, power and renewable energy, said in March, according to a Press Trust of India report. The nation has 301 billion tons of coal reserves, about 42 percent of which is proved, according to the federal coal ministry. Coal India has also   the construction of three new railway lines that will help open new mines that can produce 300 million tons of the fuel every year. Modi\u2019s government has asked Coal India to double production in five years to 1 billion tons to meet increasing demand from customers. \u201cAt the present juncture, the actual production of coal however falls short of the overall demand for coal,\u201d Goyal said in a written reply in parliament on March 16, adding one of the reasons is a lack of freight trains. The shortage of rail cars may persist.  At Titagarh Wagons Ltd., India\u2019s biggest maker of freight wagons, almost half its plant capacity is idle because of a lack of orders, Chairman J.P. Chowdhary said. \u201cPlant capacity use will fall further if new orders don\u2019t come in three, four months,\u201d Chowdhary said by phone. \u201cBecause of a lack of orders, people are quoting very low prices, making the business unviable.\u201d Indian Railways, which has been in operation for 162 years, is the nation\u2019s biggest mover of bulk goods, including coal, iron ore, grains and fertilizer.

While the restrictions placed on a type of dealer\u2019s license often used by foreign desks to trade in Canada don\u2019t apply to bonds, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG have opted to stop transacting locally in the U.S. dollar-denominated debt of the nation\u2019s junk-rated firms as well, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The moves have raised concern that bonds from the likes of Bombardier Inc., Air Canada, and Quebecor Media Inc. may become more difficult for Canadian investors to trade, making it harder for companies to borrow in the\u00a0$1.3 trillion U.S. junk-bond market. They come as global regulations implemented since the 2008 financial crisis squeeze banks\u2019 profit margins and make them more selective about what businesses they operate in. \"Most of these Canadian companies issue bonds in U.S. dollars, and they\u2019re only traded on Wall Street, on U.S. desks,\" Nicholas Leach, who manages C$2.5 billion in high-yield debt at CIBC Asset Management, said by phone from Toronto. \"So right now it\u2019s creating a lack of liquidity, and that\u2019s contributing to higher volatility of some of these Canadian issuers.\" The Canadian Securities Administrators, a coalition of the country\u2019s provincial and territorial securities regulators,\u00a0on July 11   the ability of institutions to deal privately in exchange-traded securities using the \"exempt market dealer\" designation that many foreign trading desks have used to do business with Canadians. After the change, the only way for banks and similar firms to trade off exchange in listed securities with Canadian investors is through a fully registered Canadian investment dealer. Though bonds are always privately traded, and therefore classified as over-the-counter securities not subject to the restriction, uncertainty caused by the change has foreign trading desks hesitant to trade Canadian bonds with Canadians, according to Geof Marshall, who runs C$11 billion ($8.3 billion) in high-yield bonds for CI Investments Inc. in Toronto. \"The sales people and the traders are beholden to a compliance department that\u2019s exceedingly cautious,\"\u00a0Marshall said. \"The hesitation is to err on the side of conservatism, whereas prior to 2007 it would have been, \u2018go for it.\u2019\" While many of the world\u2019s biggest banks have registered brokers in Canada, not all those units are set up, in terms of personnel and systems, to trade all types of securities.\u00a0U.S. dollar high-yield bonds are often traded from New York desks, even if they\u2019re issued by Canadian companies. \u201cGoldman Sachs\u2019 Canadian broker-dealer in Toronto supports Canadian equity share trading with local clients,\" said Michael Duvally, a spokesman for the bank, in an e-mail statement. \"Our Canadian clients\u2019 needs are very important to us and we are currently evaluating whether to extend local broker-dealer support to trading of other Canadian products with Canadian clients.\u201d Goldman is the 11th most active underwriter of Canadian high yield bonds in U.S. dollars this year, while Deutsche Bank is the 12th most active, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Royal Bank of Canada, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc., Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG are the top five, the data show. Troy Gravitt, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, declined to comment. Kate Betts-Wilmott, a spokeswoman for the Ontario Securities Commission, referred questions about the effect the rule change is having on the high-yield bond market to the text of the  , which includes the exemption for over-the-counter securities. Junk bonds of all kinds have become more difficult to trade in the U.S. as other post-crisis regulations make it costlier for banks to hold the securities on their balance sheets, making them less willing to fill their traditional role as intermediary in trades. U.S. dollar borrowing costs are already rising faster on average for junk-rated Canadian firms than their American peers. Canadian companies\u2019 $49 billion of U.S. dollar high-yield bonds are heading for their worst annual loss since the 2008 credit crisis, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data, amid plunging commodity prices and global market volatility. Because Canadian investors make up a large part of the market for Canadian high-yield bonds south of the border, cutting them off from some dealers may make the securities harder still to trade, according to CI\u2019s Marshall. \"You\u2019re taking away a little bit of demand from that order book,\" he said. \"Therefore you\u2019re slightly increasing the prices. You\u2019re making it slightly more difficult for Canadian companies to fund.\"","timestamp":1443402001.0,"participant_ids":["GS:US","DBK:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-28\/goldman-deutsche-bank-abandon-canada-junk-bonds-on-trading-rule","subject":"Goldman, Deutsche Bank Abandon Canada Junk Bonds on Trading Rule"},{"body":" Bill Winters will probably bring little cheer to investors when he reports his first earnings since taking the helm of Standard Chartered Plc, with analysts forecasting a capital gap of as much as $10 billion. Winters, who became chief executive officer on June 10, will probably say on Wednesday that first-half revenue fell 7 percent to $8.8 billion, the average estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey shows. Loan losses may have jumped 10 percent to $1.1 billion, according to analysts at Barclays Plc. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the results to be particularly encouraging with revenues likely to still be under pressure, credit quality another area of concern and little capital progression,\u201d said Rohith Chandra-Rajan, an analyst at Barclays with an overweight rating on the shares. \u201cGiven our concerns on credit quality, we expect the company to raise capital.\u201d Winters, 53, a former co-head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s investment bank, is under pressure to reverse a two-year slide in earnings and a stock slump that cost predecessor Peter Sands his job. With slumping commodity prices weighing on some Asian clients and rising bad loans and legal bills crimping profit, the new CEO may struggle to restore investor confidence. British lenders are seeking ways to shore up their capital buffers as regulators prepare to conduct a second round of stress tests, focusing on developing markets and commodities exposure. Standard Chartered may have to plug a capital shortfall of between $5 billion and $10 billion, according to analysts at Barclays and Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. So far, Winters hasn\u2019t been able to stem a slump in shares, which eroded a fifth of the company\u2019s market value over the past year. HSBC Holdings Plc, which also generates most of its earnings in Asia, has slipped about 7 percent in that period. \u201cWe are very pro-Bill -- he\u2019s good, but it is still early days and he\u2019s got a big job there,\u201d said Martin Gilbert, CEO of Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which is the bank\u2019s second-largest shareholder. \u201cPeople are surprised that a banker of his caliber accepted the job, and we are pleased he did.\u201d Under Sands, the bank ruled out a capital increase, instead focusing on 4,000 job cuts to help save about $1.8 billion through 2017. The bank\u2019s common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of high-quality capital, was 10.7 percent at the end of 2014, lagging a target of between 11 percent and 12 percent. That prompted some analysts to forecast a dividend cut. Dividend Cut? To mitigate capital pressures an \u201cobvious area is the dividend policy, which we believe will be a focus of Mr. Winters\u2019 attention,\u201d said Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd., who has an underperform rating on the stock. \u201cWe now incorporate a halving of the dividend over the next three years\u201d to 42 cents a share, he said. Standard Chartered may also continue to cut its exposure to risky commodities to offset the impact of a global rout. The bank trimmed $6 billion from its commodity book to leave $55 billion in the second half of 2014, according to its annual report. That share may decline to below $50 billion in the first six months of 2015, according to Bernstein. \u201cWe expect questions to management on forward-looking credit indicators, and an update on continued efforts to de-risk the loan book particularly given recent commodity price movements,\u201d David Lock, a London-based analyst for Deutsche Bank AG, said in a note. Lock forecasts loan impairments will rise to about $1 billion in the six-month period. HSBC said on Monday that first-half profit rose 10 percent to $13.6 billion, beating analyst estimates. Winters has said his top executives will develop a plan by year-end to \u201caddress the future performance of the group.\u201d The new CEO had to rebuild his management team following the departure of senior executives including Asia CEO Jaspal Bindra and Viswanathan Shankar, head of Europe, Middle East, Africa and Americas. The company will also have to recruit a new chairman as John Peace prepares to step down next year. Barclays, Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank have also replaced their CEOs this year as Europe\u2019s largest banks seek ways to boost revenue amid rising costs. \u201cWe note the continuing loss of key talent from the organization which could make a return to growth that much more challenging to deliver,\u201d said Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec Plc in London, who has a hold rating on the shares.","timestamp":1438632060.0,"participant_ids":["STAN:LN","STAN:LN","BARC:LN","BARC:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-03\/standard-chartered-capital-gap-seen-overshadowing-winters-debut","subject":"Standard Chartered Capital Gap Seen Overshadowing Winters Debut"},{"body":" Standard Chartered Plc Deputy Chief Executive Officer Mike Rees, who survived a management overhaul last month, earned $72 million in the six years after the financial crisis, company filings show. Rees, 59, the architect of Standard Chartered\u2019s corporate and investment bank, earned $6.95 million last year on top of the $65 million awarded in the period 2009 to 2013, more than departing CEO Peter Sands at $5.1 million, according to company filings. The London-based firm\u2019s returns on equity and assets, measures of profitability, have slumped over the past six years. \u201cFrom a shareholder perspective this is utterly nuts, because you\u2019ve got a senior executive getting whacking great payments even when performance is worse than peers,\u201d said Chris Roebuck, a visiting professor at Cass Business School. \u201cInvestors need to get a grip and pressure the board to make performance measurements for executives reflective of the real performance of the business.\u201d Rees weathered a senior management   after falling earnings and a 39 percent drop in shares in the last two years drew the ire of investors. CEO Sands, Chairman John Peace and Asia head Jaspal Bindra are leaving the bank and most of the board relinquished their bonuses. Investors vote on the compensation report in May after the lender suffered the biggest pay revolt among U.K. banks last year. \u201cBetween 2009 and 2013 when Mike was responsible for wholesale banking, this business generated $53 billion of income\u201d and $25.5 billion of profit, the bank said by e-mail.

Singapore\u2019s Temasek Holdings Pte, Standard Chartered\u2019s largest shareholder with 17.7 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, praised the hiring of Winters and said board \u201crenewal must continue.\u201d \u201cBill Winters will want to evaluate every single remaining senior manager at the bank over a period of time to see whether they fit in with the culture he foresees and the structure he wants to implement,\u201d said Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s also a two-way street. The question is whether Mike Rees will want to stay because he\u2019ll undoubtedly lose some responsibility.\u201d The bank\u2019s pay policy was   by 41 percent of voting shareholders at its annual general meeting last May. After its next AGM on May 6 in London, senior independent director Ruth Markland steps down as remuneration committee chairman to be replaced by Christine Hodgson, who joined the board in 2013. Rees built Standard Chartered\u2019s investment bank and trade finance operations after becoming CEO of wholesale banking in 2002, expanding the unit to account for more than 70 percent of the lender\u2019s assets and profit by 2013. He joined the board in 2009 and was made deputy-CEO in 2014 when the bank merged its wholesale and consumer units under Rees\u2019s direction.

Similarly, the bank\u2019s return on assets has fallen from 89 basis points in 2009 to 53 basis points last year, according to a March 17 report from Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Chirantan Barua. In recent years revenue from financial markets -- which includes rates, currencies and capital markets -- has retreated, falling 12 percent last year. Provisions on loans linked to commodities have surged and the bank lost billions of dollars after expanding in countries including Korea and the United Arab Emirates. An independent monitor oversees the bank to ensure it complies with sanctions and anti-money laundering rules, installed in 2012 after it breached a U.S. ban on transactions in Iran and settled for $667 million.

The vaccine was 100 percent effective when it was tested on more than 4,000 people who were in close contact with Ebola patients in the African nation of Guinea, according to a study published today in the Lancet medical journal. The trial of the vaccine, called Ebola ca Suffit -- \u201cEbola, that\u2019s enough\u201d in French -- began on March 23. Ebola has killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa following an outbreak that began in late 2013. While the incidence has fallen off sharply, it hasn\u2019t been eradicated, with seven confirmed cases in the week of July 29. The vaccine from Merck is one of several in clinical trials, with GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Novavax Inc. also developing medicines. \u201cThis is an extremely promising development,\u201d Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement. \u201cAn effective vaccine will be another very important tool for both current and future Ebola outbreaks.\u201d The vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics Corp. In November, Merck entered in an agreement to research, develop and distribute the vaccine. Charles Link, NewLink\u2019s chief executive officer, said the company doesn\u2019t intend to make any significant profit in Africa or developing countries from the potential Ebola vaccine. \u201cWe are really focused on doing everything we can to contribute and help in any material way that we can for the crisis in Africa,\u201d Link said on a conference call Friday to discuss earnings. The agreement with Merck envisions \u201csignificant\u201d royalties coming from other parts of the world in the future, he said. NewLink shares rose 3.3 percent to $52.86 at 10:48 a.m. in New York, while Merck rose 1 percent to $59.11. Kenilworth, New Jersey-based Merck gets more than 10 percent of its $40 billion in annual revenue from sales of vaccines for illnesses such as human papillomavirus, or HPV, and shingles. The Lancet, in an   accompanying the study, called the result a \u201cremarkable scientific and logistical achievement.\u201d In the trial, researchers vaccinated anyone in the close circle of contacts of a newly infected person, targeting those most likely to get the disease after a new case. The Lancet called it the largest-scale trial ever performed in Guinea. People in the study were protected against the Ebola virus within six to 10 days of vaccination. The late-stage trial is continuing, and other studies are in progress, with the goal of submitting the vaccine for regulatory approval around the world. To create the vaccine, scientists removed a gene from another virus, vesicular stomatitis, and replaced it with an Ebola virus gene that can\u2019t cause the disease alone. That could let people who get the vaccine develop antibodies against Ebola. It\u2019s still unclear how significant or long the immune response to the vaccine will be, Merck said. The economic disruption caused by Ebola cost Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone more than half a billion dollars in 2014, almost 5 percent of their combined gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. Ebola has proven resilient even in as the countries and international health organizations have stepped up their public-health measures to contain the virus.

According to court papers, the dispute began in 1994, when Adidas noticed Skechers was selling shoes bearing parallel stripes that the German company said infringed its marks. That suit was settled in 1995.  The issue recurred, with multiple agreements between the two companies over Skechers\u2019s alleged sale of shoes that were confusingly similar to the ones Adidas makes, the German company said in its pleadings.  The newest suit accuses Manhattan Beach, California-based Skechers of selling athletic shoes that infringe the Adidas \u201cSupernova\u201d trademarks and the trade dress of its Stan Smith shoes. In its pleadings, Adidas accuses Skechers of showing \u201ca callous disregard for Adidas\u2019 trademark and trade dress\u201d as well as the \u201cnumerous agreements\u201d between the two companies over various trademark issues in the past.  Skechers didn\u2019t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment on the suit.

While there were plenty of questions about the hometown Golden State Warriors and which athletes he hasn\u2019t gotten along with over the years (home run king Barry Bonds is No. 1 on that list, too), there was little interest in the arrest of seven top global soccer officials in Switzerland. That got Sports Line thinking about whether a probe into possible corruption in the soccer governing body FIFA should matter to U.S. kids. Even if those charged with racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering are convicted and removed from their FIFA posts, will there really be any immediate change in the game or how it is overseen? Will it change the balance of power on the field, where only eight nations have won the title in 20 tournaments since the World Cup debuted in 1930? Probably not. Sure, the $150 million in bribes and kickbacks that U.S. prosecutors charge was paid to soccer officials could be put to better use. And perhaps the 2022 World Cup will be taken away from Qatar and moved to the U.S., so some of those middle-school students might be attending those games while in college. But the real impact might be a generation away. The U.S. probe could help shake up an entrenched soccer establishment badly in need of change, starting at the top with President Sepp Blatter. None of the middle school kids asked Sports Line about the  , which begins June 6 in Canada and garners far less interest than the men.

He also has called himself the \u201cgodfather\u201d of women\u2019s soccer. Yes, it\u2019s time for change. *** Both the New York Rangers and the Tampa Bay Lightning have statistics on their side as they head into a decisive Game 7 in the NHL\u2019s Eastern Conference finals, with the winner of Friday\u2019s game at Madison Square Garden advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Rangers are 4-0 this postseason in games when they\u2019ve faced elimination, including Tuesday\u2019s 7-3 win at Tampa to tie the series at three games apiece. New York rallied from a 3-1 deficit in the previous series to oust the Washington Capitals, winning Game 7 in overtime at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers, and goalie Henrik Lundqvist, are 15-3 in elimination games since the start of the 2012 postseason. \u201cIf you look at the record, I think it\u2019s just a good sign of the team showing up for the big games,\u201d Lundqvist said after Tuesday\u2019s win. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to work really hard.\u201d The Lightning already have won two games in this series in New York, and have rebounded well from big losses such as Tuesday\u2019s defeat. Tampa Bay has had three previous losses this postseason by three or more goals, and twice came back to win the next game. \u201cWhenever we\u2019ve had a low, we\u2019ve found a way to come back with a high, so we have to look at it that way,\u201d center Steven Stamkos said. \u201cThere\u2019s a Game 7, and we have to respond.\u201d *** For Jack Nicklaus, family has always been more important than his legacy.

With a six-month deadline to award contracts, who\u2019s going to pay for the country\u2019s biggest project yet remains a mystery. Price-tag estimates for as many as eight reactors generating 9,600 megawatts, which the government wants to begin operating from 2023 and complete by 2029, range from $37 billion to $100 billion. Bids are due to start this quarter, with Russia\u2019s state-owned Rosatom Corp. seen as a leader. Areva SA, EDF SA, Toshiba Corp.\u2019s Westinghouse Electric Corp., China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Corp. and Korea Electric Power Corp. have also shown interest. The planned investment comes as the government battles to fend off a junk-grade credit rating and the National Treasury seeks to rein in the budget deficit. Proceeding with the nuclear plants could result in a large increase in public debt, the International Monetary Fund warned in a June 24  . \u201cThere appears to be a simple-minded assumption that countries like China or Russia will provide cheap plants and offer finance,\u201d Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich in the U.K., who has monitored South Africa\u2019s nuclear plans since 1997, said in a June 24 phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s an illusion.\u201d Analysts including IHS Country Risk\u2019s  Robert Besseling and Teneo Intelligence\u2019s Anne Fruhauf see Rosatom as the most likely bidder to win the contract. Rosatom has agreed to fund construction of plants elsewhere. In 2013, Hungarian President Viktor Orban agreed a 12 billion-euro ($13.3 billion) expansion to a nuclear power plant with Rosatom, funded with a 10 billion-euro loan from Russia, payable over 30 years at below-market rates. Hungary\u2019s parliament classified the details of the deal for three decades. \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on financial terms of our possible bid until South Africa starts the tender and clarifies the tender conditions,\u201d Rosatom spokesman Sergey Novikov said by phone from Moscow on July 3. Rosatom may have a head-start in the bidding because of the close historical ties between South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress and Russia, the IHS and Teneo analysts said. President Jacob Zuma has met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin several times over the past year and the two nations have signed a nuclear cooperation accord. The agreement provides a \u201cproper and solid platform for future extensive collaboration,\u201d South African Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson said in a statement in September. South Africa has concluded similar pacts with China, France, the U.S., Japan and South Korea. State power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. operates South Africa\u2019s sole nuclear plant, the 1,800-megawatt Koeberg facility near Cape Town, which has been in operation since 1984. Five years ago, the government shelved plans to additional conventional atomic stations because they were too expensive and difficult to finance. The government has revived its nuclear expansion plans as it seeks to address energy shortages that are already causing blackouts and to reduce its reliance on coal. The new reactors could cost as much as $100 billion over 15 years, according to Des Muller, head of Johannesburg-based building company Group Five Ltd.\u2019s nuclear construction division. That\u2019s more than five times what Eskom is spending on two coal-fired plants that will generate a similar amount of power. A study published in 2013 by the University of Cape Town\u2019s Energy Research Centre found nuclear plants weren\u2019t needed and wouldn\u2019t be cost-effective for 15 to 25 years, based on a projected cost of $7,000 per kilowatt installed. The Department of Energy\u2019s 2013 master-plan -- which the government rejected -- suggested deferring a decision on whether to build atomic power facilities until at least 2025, and scrapping the option if the cost exceeded $6,500 per kilowatt of capacity. Thomas estimates current costs at about $8,000 per kilowatt installed. The nuclear program will benefit the country for the next 80 years and promote industrialization, said Zizamele Mbambo, a deputy director-general at the Department of Energy. \u201cThe return on investment will far exceed the investment,\u201d he told reporters in Cape Town on June 2. While the new plants will go ahead, the cost and funding arrangements still have to be worked out, according to the energy minister. \u201cThe true test of affordability for nuclear power will be in the price and financial offering provided by technology suppliers,\u201d she said in a written reply to a parliamentary question on June 11. \u201cIt is crucial to start the actual nuclear procurement as soon as possible. The expected cost of the project will be announced once the procurement process has been finalized.\u201d While Zuma and his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa back the nuclear program, the Treasury is more circumspect. \u201cNuclear would be a substantial financial commitment and government can only make the final commitment after careful and thorough modeling and an affordability assessment,\u201d it said in an e-mailed response to questions on June 29. The Treasury\u2019s three-year budget released Feb. 25 provides for the budget deficit to be cut to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product by the year though March 2018, from 3.9 percent this financial year, and doesn\u2019t allocate any money for new nuclear plants. Moody\u2019s Investors Service rates South African debt at Baa2, the second-lowest investment grade, while Standard & Poor\u2019s has an assessment one level above junk. \u201cI\u2019ve always been skeptical of such an ambitious program for a country like South Africa,\u201d Chris Gadomski, a nuclear-power analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said by phone from San Francisco on June 29. \u201cYou have gone through this exercise in 2007-8. What stopped it was the lack of finance. My thinking is that very little has changed in the country as far as the capacity to finance something like this.\u201d While the government may consider requesting companies to build, own and operate the nuclear plants subject to power-purchase agreements, developers don\u2019t favor such deals because the projects are so capital-intensive, said Elchin Mammadov, a utilities analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. Most reactors in developing countries other than China and India are likely to be financed with 15- to 20-year subsidized loans provided by the suppliers\u2019 host nations, he said by phone from London on June 29. The government will battle to finance the plants even if it gets cheap loans, and off-take agreements are the only viable nuclear option if power-tariff increases can be contained, said Nazmeera Moola, an economist at Investec Asset Management. \u201cIf the build costs a reasonable amount of money and it ends up being that the tariff required to fund it is viable, great,\u201d she said by phone from Cape Town. \u201cIt all depends on how much it costs.\u201d Detailed financial analysis should precede any decision to invest in additional nuclear capacity, said Harald Winkler, the Energy Research Centre\u2019s director. \u201cThere are serious questions that need to be answered as to whether South Africa is able to finance this program and how any investment would have to be repaid,\u201d he said by phone on June 26. \u201cIt\u2019s very unclear.\u201d","timestamp":1436122801.0,"participant_ids":["2731593Z:RU","3470094Z:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-05\/will-putin-pay-for-100-billion-south-africa-nuclear-power-plan-","subject":"Will Putin Pay for $100 Billion South Africa Nuclear Plan?"},{"body":"1Malaysia Development Bhd., the debt-ridden state investment company, has shortlisted bidders including Qatar\u2019s Nebras Power QSC and Hong Kong-listed CGN Meiya Power Holdings Co. for its energy asset sale, people familiar with the matter said.

Sure, they\u2019ve plunged two-thirds in the past five years, but the rate of decline has leveled off -- in the past 18 months they\u2019re down just 5.1 percent. That\u2019s why solar companies are looking at Enphase Energy Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc. to help them wring more costs out of the electronic gadgetry that drives rooftop power systems. Enphase and SolarEdge are the two biggest suppliers of inverters for U.S. rooftop systems -- a critical yet unheralded component. They\u2019re generally seen as the brains of a system and account for as much as a third of the total cost. The two companies are locked in a technology battle, offering competing approaches and racing to lower prices. They\u2019ll both report results this week, and the numbers will help crown a winner. \u201cThe weakest link in a solar system is the inverter, and it\u2019s a big part of the cost,\u201d said Jigar Shah, a clean-energy investor and consultant. \u201cAnyone who can offer a smart panel at a lower price is going to win market share.\u201d An inverter is essentially a box full of magnets and wires that converts the direct current electricity that flows from solar panels into the alternating current that\u2019s sent across the grid. As demand for clean power booms, and especially demand for residential solar, the inverter market is on track to increase 15 percent to $7.3 billion this year, and another 9 percent in 2016 to $8 billion, according to GTM Research. The company to watch is SolarEdge, which is expected to become the top inverter supplier for U.S. rooftops this year, surpassing incumbent Enphase, according to GTM. The Herziliya Pituach, Israel-based company\u2019s growth stems from a design that the company says makes it cheaper than products from Enphase. SolarEdge introduced a new inverter at the Solar Power International conference in Anaheim, California, in September, that Lior Handelsman, co-founder and vice president of marketing, said reduces weight and uses digital processing to improve performance. \u201cThis is revolutionary,\u201d he said. Those changes translate to more power produced on more rooftops at a lower cost than competing products. \u201cIt puts us on a much better improvement curve.\u201d In the quarter that ended in June, Enphase sold inverters for an average of about 52 cents a watt, compared to SolarEdge\u2019s average price of about 35 cents a watt, based on the amount of megawatts shipped and total sales, said Michael Morosi, an analyst at Avondale Partners LLC in Nashville, Tennessee. SolarEdge is expected Wednesday to report quarterly sales of $110 million, up 64 percent from a year earlier, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income will increase almost fivefold to $12 million. Enphase sales aren\u2019t increasing as fast. The Petaluma, California-based company is expected to report Tuesday revenue of $103 million for the third quarter, up 3.9 percent from a year earlier, and a loss of $2.64 million, compared with an $813,000 profit. Enphase has lost 76 percent of its market value this year through Monday, the most in the WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index of 105 clean energy companies. SolarEdge\u2019s U.S. shares have gained less than 1 percent since they were listed in March. Those numbers reflect a shift in the market, said Vishal Shah, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in New York. \u201cEnphase remains at risk of share loss against SolarEdge despite benefiting from strong growth of the U.S. market,\u201d Shah said in a note to clients. He downgraded the shares to sell, saying profit margins are under threat from increasing competition and pricing pressure. \u201cUntil the company releases new lower-cost products in late 2016, we expect downside risk to margins.\u201d Historically, solar installers would connect a single inverter, about the size of a laser printer, to a bank of about a dozen or so panels. Smaller rooftop systems typically used a single inverter to control all the panels. A key problem with this design is that if one panel fails, they\u2019re all wired together and they all go down. Enphase addressed this by introducing\u00a0in 2008 micro-inverters, smartphone-sized units that attach to the bottom of every panel and handle the electricity from only that one. That can make installation easier, and cheaper, and also help meet tightening fire-safety regulations that require ways to shut off rooftop power systems within 10 feet of the panels. That helped make Enphase the top inverter supplier for the U.S. rooftop market. SolarEdge entered the U.S. rooftop market in 2012 using a different design: a single centralized inverter to control the system, plus another device called an optimizer, small units that attach to each panel. The setup means individual panels can be monitored and controlled, and the whole thing won\u2019t go down if a single panel has problems. Handelsman said this approach is more cost-effective than Enphase. \u201cValue-wise we\u2019re always the best,\u201d he said at the Solar Power International conference. \u201cSolarEdge is definitely gaining market share from Enphase in the U.S. residential market,\u201d\u00a0said Scott Moskowitz, an analyst at GTM Research in New York. \u201cPricing is a big part of that. SolarEdge has been able to prove their system lowers overall costs.\u201d Enphase CEO Paul Nahi concedes that his company is losing share in the U.S. rooftop market, and has a plan to expand production and cut costs. \u201cSolar is going to be a huge part of the energy puzzle and we\u2019re providing the brains that make it much more valuable,\u201d Nahi said in an interview. \u201cOutside of the U.S. we\u2019re gaining market share.

Finnish Economy Minister Olli Rehn said in Helsinki on Wednesday that the backing of three Finnish companies pushed the Fennovoima Oy project past a threshold set by the government to allow the plant to continue with the needed approval processes. State-controlled utility Fortum Oyj, stainless steel maker Outokumpu Oyj and real estate developer SRV Oyj announced earlier on Wednesday plans to either buys stakes in Fennovoima or increase their current holdings. The last minute commitments fulfilled the government\u2019s publicly stated goal of having 60 percent ownership for the new reactor from within the European Union and European Free Trade Association. \u201cAll three companies have made their decisions fully independently,\u201d Rehn told reporters, adding that the approvals still necessary will take about two years to complete. Rosatom Corp. -- a Russian-state owned nuclear company that does everything from purchasing uranium to design, construction and commissioning of plants -- had offered to step in to fill the gap. The Finns, however, balked at the idea of Rosatom, which has been contracted to build the reactor and owns 34 percent of the project, of having too much influence. Backers had been hoping for a last-minute deal that would see Fortum, majority owned by the Finnish state, taking a 15 percent stake in Fennovoima. In exchange, Fortum wants to buy a majority holding in the TGC-1 hydro assets in northeastern Russia, near the Finnish border. Fortum announced Wednesday that it will buy a 6.6 percent Fennovoima holding, and that talks over the hydro power purchase are ongoing. SRV said in statement that the construction company will take a 1.8 percent stake in the nuclear plant and serve as project manager for the site. Outokumpu, whose biggest shareholder is the Finnish state, is increasing its holding 1.8 percentage points to 14 percent. \u201cTwo state-controlled firms, Outokumpu and Fortum, were forced to participate, with the latter showing extremely bad negotiation skills,\u201d said Jukka Oksaharju, a Helsinki-based equity strategist at Nordnet AB, which offers securities transactions over the Internet. \u201cFortum will not anymore be able to get credible commercial commitments on the hydro assets.\u201d Fennovoima\u2019s application at the end of June to move forward with the project was rejected after the government tossed Croatia-based Migrit Solarna Energija from the list of EU-based investors, arguing the company was receiving its financing from Russia. Rehn at that time extended the deadline for lining up European investors until Aug. 6.","timestamp":1438714860.0,"participant_ids":["3371071Z:FH","FUM1V:FH"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-04\/russia-s-nuclear-funding-puts-finns-on-edge-amid-reactor-talks","subject":"Finnish Nuclear Plant to Move Ahead After Financing Secured"},{"body":" SolarEdge Technologies Inc., a maker of power optimizers for photovoltaic systems, filed for a $125 million initial public offering on the Nasdaq.

Gillman started Jan. 5 in the new position of chairman for Impressionist and modern art, senior vice president of the Americas, according to a statement yesterday. He will work with Giovanna Bertazzoni, international head of Impressionist and modern art, and Brooke Lampley, international director of the department. \u201cChristie\u2019s has been looking to strengthen its Impressionist and modern team for a while now,\u201d said Michael Plummer, a partner in advisory firm Artvest Partners. The hire is the latest step in a management revamp at Christie\u2019s, which last month named Patricia Barbizet, the longtime adviser to the auction house\u2019s owner, French billionaire Francois Pinault, as chief executive officer, replacing Steven Murphy. Sotheby\u2019s in November said its leader, William Ruprecht, will step down following calls from activist investor Daniel Loeb to cut costs and increase shareholder value. Ruprecht is continuing as CEO until a successor is named. Both auction houses are under pressure to land the best works. In 2014, $16 billion of art was sold at   worldwide, more than double from $6.3 billion in 2009, according to New York-based researcher Artnet. While Christie\u2019s dominates sales of contemporary art, Sotheby\u2019s leads in Impressionist and modern art. In the day and evening auctions in New York in November, Sotheby\u2019s sold $470 million of art in that category, which includes Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Paul Cezanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Christie\u2019s totaled $192.7 million at its sales. The top lot at its  , an Edouard Manet painting of a woman with a parasol, sold for $65.1 million, setting an auction record for the artist. \u201cDerek has an unbelievably strong global network of art collectors that he has cultivated during his extensive and distinguished career in the art world,\u201d Marc Porter, chairman of Christie\u2019s, Americas, said in a statement. \u201cThose relationships, coupled with his knowledge about the Impressionist and modern fields, will be a tremendous asset.\u201d Gillman, 62, led the Barnes from 2006 to 2013 during its controversial move to downtown Philadelphia. In 2013, after years of lawsuits and heated opposition, the   - - the name of the body that oversees the museum\u2019s collection -- relocated to a modern building from its original home in Merion, Pennsylvania. Albert Barnes, a doctor and chemist, died in 1951, leaving a collection that included 181 Renoirs. \u201cThe capstone of my public career was the unique opportunity to be part of the renewal of the Barnes Foundation, which made Albert Barnes\u2019 unparalleled collection of Impressionist and modern art much more accessible to the public,\u201d Gillman said in the statement. With the exception of four years at Christie\u2019s in London from 1977 to 1981 in its Chinese art department, Gillman\u2019s background is in the nonprofit and academic world. He will be based in New York at Christie\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019ll bring a wealth of contacts and expertise to a role that will supplement the talent they already have,\u201d said Mary Hoeveler, an art adviser who previously worked at Christie\u2019s.

The auction house, which doesn\u2019t report revenue or profit, said sales for 2014 will be released at the end of this month.

But ditch the auction paddle. This sale is online. Sotheby\u2019s and EBay Inc. will debut their partnership to offer live online auctions on April 1, starting with New York-themed prints, paintings and memorabilia, and photographs from the 19th century to the postwar era. Sotheby\u2019s wants to expand auctions beyond the showroom to EBay\u2019s 155 million buyers worldwide. The New York-based auction house and the San Jose-based Internet marketplace announced the partnership in July as investors including hedge fund manager Dan Loeb pressured Sotheby\u2019s to improve performance. \u201cIt\u2019s deliberately built in a way that should appeal to the new audience that Sotheby\u2019s doesn\u2019t speak to today,\u201d said Josh Pullan, Sotheby\u2019s director of e-commerce, referring to the 30-to-40-year-olds. \u201cIt\u2019s really vibrant and dynamic.\u201d Accelerating Sotheby\u2019s use of technology is among early items on the to-do list by the company\u2019s newly elected Chief Executive Officer Tad Smith, he said in a conference call with investors on March 16. A number of companies are trying to shake up the Internet art market as sales rise but profit remains elusive. Online art sales increased by 32 percent to 3.3 billion euros ($3.5 million) in 2014 from 2.5 billion euros in the prior year, according to an annual report published March 11 by the European Fine Art Foundation. The new platform, ebay.com\/sothebys, will broadcast every auction at Sotheby\u2019s New York headquarters except for its big, semi-annual evening sales in May and November. The site goes live on March 17. Visitors can scroll through upcoming events and review inventory, register in advance and participate live using a blue bid button. Live video of the auctioneer and images of the item being sold appear on the screen during an auction in an attempt to replicate the live auction experience online. The sweet spot for both companies will be items valued at $25,000 or less, Sotheby\u2019s said. The auction house will promote such artworks and collectibles with special editorial content, including videos, essays and interviews with collectors and taste makers. That type of promotional focus is typically reserved for top lots by the likes of Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso. A short video next to Sinatra\u2019s untitled 1985 geometric abstract painting tells the story of the singer\u2019s art hobby. Elsewhere, hip-hop artist Swizz Beatz and fashion designer Anna Sui talk about what they love about New York City.

Many of EBay\u2019s customers are interested in auctions and collectibles. In 2014, 36 million EBay shoppers spent almost $8 billion on collectibles, according to the company. EBay has hosted fine art and collectibles sales on its platform for about 200 houses, including Doyle New York, Swann Auction Galleries, Heritage Auctions and Freeman\u2019s. Sotheby\u2019s will become EBay\u2019s \u201canchor partner\u201d in the art and collectibles section. \u201cThis is the first   on EBay, and we will open this feature up to other auction houses shortly,\u201d EBay spokesman Ryan Moore said. Since starting live auctions in October, collectibles such as Elvis Presley\u2019s first record sold on EBay for $300,000, said Devin Wenig, president of EBay marketplaces. Online auctions have \u201copened the door for more people to appreciate and participate in bidding on exceptional works of art, antiques and collectibles,\u201d Wenig said in a statement. Sotheby\u2019s said it had about 25 percent more buyers online in 2014 compared with previous year. John James Audubon\u2019s \u201cThe Birds of America\u201d sold in April 2014 for $3.5 million, a record for an online purchase in a live auction at Sotheby\u2019s, the auction house said.

That was clear at the annual London auctions earlier this month. Barnes & Noble Inc. Chairman Leonard Riggio made about 53 percent in less than three years when his Twombly painting sold for 17.5 million pounds ($26.7 million), before fees, at Christie\u2019s on Feb. 11. Another work by the late artist at the same sale failed to find a buyer. As rising prices attract speculators along with collectors, chasing profits can be risky because values for different pieces by the same artist tend to vary widely whether it\u2019s Twombly, Gerhard Richter or Andy Warhol. That isn\u2019t stopping billionaires from bidding up marquee works in a market increasingly being driven by the top end. Global auctions of postwar and contemporary art reached $7.8 billion in 2014 with sales fees, doubling since 2010, according to New York-based Artnet. \u201cArt is taste-driven, not performance-driven,\u201d said Todd Levin, director of New York-based consultancy Levin Art Group. \u201cNo amount of money can buy you a better ounce of 24-karat gold than I can buy -- the price is the same at any given moment. But every Richter or Twombly is unique, and therefore has a different value.\u201d Riggio\u2019s Twombly, \u201cUntitled (New York City),\u201d a 1970 painting resembling a blackboard densely scribbled with chalk, was the   at Christie\u2019s. The artist\u2019s 1967 canvas \u201cPortrait of Alvise Di Robilant,\u201d depicting an oddly shaped figure with pencil and crayon, failed to sell after being estimated at as high as 800,000 pounds. \u201cEven if it\u2019s something by Cy Twombly, who is so established, you are making a judgment call to pay a certain price for a certain quality,\u201d said Wendy Cromwell, an adviser at New York-based  . Twombly\u2019s blackboard paintings, created from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, are his most coveted. Another 1970 \u201cUntitled\u201d painting of loops on a gray background fetched $69.6 million at Christie\u2019s in New York in November, a   for the artist. \u201cThose pictures are almost a brand in and of themselves,\u201d Cromwell said. \u201cAnyone who wants something that screams \u2018Twombly!\u2019 would go for that picture.\u201d Twombly\u2019s other series have commanded less. His painting \u201cCrimes of Passion I\u201d from 1960 -- showing clusters of body parts, Roman numerals and scribbles in pencil and crayon -- sold for $6.25 million at Sotheby\u2019s on Feb. 10, squeaking past the low target with fees. The work, sold by musician Eric Clapton, appreciated about 8 percent from two years earlier, when it went for $5.8 million. Multiple factors affect the price of an artwork, including its condition, provenance and freshness to the market. A piece can bomb at auction because it had already been shopped around privately or because the estimate is too high. While postwar and contemporary auctions grab the spotlight, they only represented about 10 percent of the global art market in 2013, according to the annual report published by the European Fine Art Foundation. \u201cThe press and pundits like to focus on art that has produced outsized returns, but in reality most art will never appreciate in value,\u201d Levin said. The 6,650 artworks that sold more than once at auction since the late 1960s have generated the average compound annual return of 9.6 percent, according to Michael Moses, a co-founder of the Mei Moses art indexes, which measure art performance by tracking repeat auction sales. Riggio, 73, said he bought his Twombly because he loved the painting, not because he considered it a good investment. \u201cI just look at the individual piece: Whether I like it and can afford it,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. When \u201cUntitled (New York City)\u201d came up for sale at Sotheby\u2019s on May 9, 2012, it hammered at $15.4 million, near the low end of the expected range. After the buyer\u2019s premium was added, Riggio paid $17.4 million, and a new auction peak for Twombly was set. \u201cI was the only bidder, it just happened,\u201d Riggio said. \u201cI thought it would sell for $30 million. I thought it was that good.\u201d That\u2019s how much the work ended up going for earlier this month. Christie\u2019s had pegged it at 16 million pounds and guaranteed Riggio an undisclosed price regardless of the sale\u2019s outcome. He said he sold the painting because it wasn\u2019t used as intended and he doesn\u2019t like to keep things in storage. Bidding for \u201cUntitled (New York City)\u201d started at 14 million pounds. The work enticed four competitors, \u201cnone of whom were bidding at those levels in the postwar field three years ago,\u201d said Brett Gorvy, Christie\u2019s chairman and international head of postwar and contemporary art. The painting ended up selling to an undisclosed client of Xin Li, Christie\u2019s deputy chairman in Asia, for 19.7 million pounds. Riggio took home the work\u2019s hammer price. His profit kept pace with the U.S. stock market rally, as the Standard & Poor\u2019s S&P 500 Index rose 53 percent between the 2012 and 2015 auctions. \u201cI would have been happy just to get our money back,\u201d he said. Strong results require at least \u201ctwo people on the same piece who want to spend a whole lot of money,\u201d Riggio said. \u201cIf you get two paddles in there, you can go 20, 30, 40 percent higher than was expected.\u201d Such a competition occurred at Sotheby\u2019s on Feb. 10, when three bidders lifted \u201cAbstraktes Bild,\u201d a colorful, 10-foot-tall abstract painting by Richter, to an artist record of $46.4 million. The result surpassed the high estimate by 49 percent. \u201cYou are dealing with a super-duper, A-plus painting,\u201d said Christophe Van de Weghe, a New York art dealer who frequently sells Richter works. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to overpay for quality.\u201d Cheyenne Westphal, Sotheby\u2019s co-head of contemporary art worldwide, won the piece on behalf of a client bidding by phone. Billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin was the buyer, a person familiar with the matter said last week. The 1986 canvas -- a large, early example of Richter\u2019s transition from a brush to a squeegee -- had been displayed at   in Cologne, Germany, where it was on loan for 13 years until 1999. That year, the painting sold for $607,500 at Sotheby\u2019s in New York, the highest price paid for an abstract painting by Richter at the time. The work remained in the same hands until 2013 when it sold privately to an Asian client for $20 million to $25 million, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The day after the Richter record was set at Sotheby\u2019s, a smaller, less-vibrant abstract painting made by the artist in 1990 couldn\u2019t find a taker at Christie\u2019s. The flop was a blow to the owner, who had purchased the piece for $6.3 million in 2011, paying more than double its high estimate of $2.5 million. The painting\u2019s price target at this year\u2019s auction was too aggressive at $5.3 million to $6.9 million, Van de Weghe said. \u201cIf you are dealing with average quality, the estimate has to be correct,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a connoisseurs\u2019 market.\u201d","timestamp":1424919601.0,"participant_ids":["BID:US","3962732Z:NA"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-26\/riggio-made-53-on-his-twombly-work-but-yours-might-flop","subject":"Riggio Made 53% on His Twombly Work But Yours Might Flop"},{"body":" AES Corp., a power producer with operations in 18 countries on four continents, bought the solar developer Main Street Power Co. to expand its distributed-generation business.

Meeting the need for energy on demand is not just a way to cut your power bill, it\u2019s also vital to expanded use of solar and wind, intermittent resources that require backup. Traditionally electricity has had to be used when it\u2019s created. \u201cWe\u2019re at the very beginning of this quickly developing market,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, chief executive officer of  , a Santa Barbara, California-based company that\u2019s pioneering a storage method using rooftop ice. \u201cIf there\u2019s really going to be continued progress on the integration of renewables, it\u2019s absolutely essential that energy storage steps up.\u201d His company\u2019s refrigerator-sized   units are installed on the roofs of commercial buildings and connected to air conditioning systems. They freeze water at night when power rates are low, and provide cooling during the day. When they\u2019re switched on, the building\u2019s electricity consumption is reduced, freeing up capacity for the local utility. Ice Energy is one of five companies that signed deals with Edison International\u2019s Southern California Edison in November to provide a total of 261 megawatts of storage capacity. The utility will use the storage to help meet a statewide goal of getting half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Two years ago, California regulators asked the state\u2019s three biggest utilities to add 1.33 gigawatts of energy-storage capacity by 2020 -- about 20 percent more than currently exists in the world, excluding pumped hydropower systems. Ice Energy will install 1,800 Ice Bears across the region, adding about 25.6 megawatts of storage capacity for Edison. \u201cStorage has a big role to play in our market,\u201d said Colin Cushnie, the utility\u2019s vice president for energy procurement and management. \u201cWe were pleasantly surprised that energy storage was more cost-competitive that we thought.\u201d Existing batteries \u201csuck,\u201d Musk said Thursday at the rollout of his equipment for homes, businesses and utilities. \u201cThey\u2019re expensive, they\u2019re unreliable.\u201d If the storage breakthrough is coming, it seems obvious it would happen in California, which has long led the U.S. in supporting alternative energy. The state has the most demanding fuel-efficiency standards for cars, as well as incentives that have made it the biggest market for solar power in the U.S. California \u201cis often a lab\u201d for the rest of the country, said Brian Warshay, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. It will \u201ccontinue to be so on the storage front.\u201d Older methods of trying to store power have existed for decades, including pumped hydropower facilities in which water is sent to higher elevation reservoirs and released through lower turbines to produce electricity when demand is high. Another storage effort that\u2019s getting revived interest is compressed air. Dresser Rand Group Inc., which built one of the world\u2019s two operating commercial systems using the technology, is working on projects in Texas that would force air underground into caverns until it\u2019s released and heated to power a turbine. Spain\u2019s Abengoa SA is developing a solar-thermal project in California that will incorporate  . Arrays of mirrors will focus sunlight on a central tower, where a boiler will drive a turbine to produce electricity. Vats of molten salt will retain some of that heat so the plant will run after sundown. Batteries have been used on for years a smaller level to balance grid needs. With added renewables on the system, batteries have been getting bigger to help utilities handle the influx of intermittent resources. They make up the bulk of Southern California Edison\u2019s storage agreements. AES Corp. is planning a   array in Long Beach, California, that will be one of the biggest in the world. The batteries will function much like a peaking natural gas plant, standing by until demand spikes and then immediately dumping more electricity onto the grid, said Praveen Kathpal, a vice president with the Arlington, Virginia-based company\u2019s AES Energy Storage unit. AES will receive a flat monthly fee for the system to be available, plus a variable amount depending on how much energy is used. \u201cIt represents a new scale at which energy storage resources are being contemplated,\u201d said Kathpal. \u201cA hundred megawatts is the tip of the iceberg.\u201d All the storage projects will reshape the ways electricity must be produced and delivered, Edison\u2019s Cushnie said. Storing power for later is more efficient and reduces the need for new power plants. \u201cPeople are still figuring out the business models,\u201d said BNEF\u2019s Warshay. \u201cThey can see the business models, but they can\u2019t believe they will make money.\u201d","timestamp":1430487231.0,"participant_ids":["3470094Z:LN","EIX:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-01\/elon-musk-challengers-jostle-to-solve-riddle-of-energy-storage","subject":"Elon Musk Challengers Jostle to Solve Riddle of Energy Storage"},{"body":" Bulgaria\u2019s state-owned National Electricity Company AD reduced long-term power-purchase prices with the local coal-fired plants of U.S. power producers AES Corp. and ContourGlobal LP to avoid default. The renegotiated agreements will help National Electricity save 1 billion lev ($556 million) by the time they expire in 2026 with AES and 2024 with ContourGlobal, Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova said in Sofia on Wednesday. Capacity prices were cut by 14 percent for AES and 17 percent for Contour, she said. Binding agreements will be signed in the second half of the year when National Electricity settles outstanding payments of about 700 million lev to both companies, she said. \u201cThis is a serious step forward to save the Bulgarian energy industry from the financial collapse it\u2019s in,\u201d Petkova told reporters after the signing. Bulgaria\u2019s government of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, which took office five months ago, wants to overhaul the indebted state energy utilities and liberalize the energy market. Borissov\u2019s first cabinet was toppled in 2013 by mass protests against austerity and high utility bills. National Electricity, the country\u2019s dominant power utility, has total deficit of 3.3 billion lev as it bought electricity at prices higher than current market rates under long-term power-purchase agreements with solar and wind power producers, AES and ContourGlobal, according to the country\u2019s energy regulator. AES built a 670-megawatt coal-fired plant in the Maritsa East mining and power generation complex for 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion), which was put into operation in 2011. Enel SpA completed a 700 million-euro expansion and raised the plant\u2019s capacity to 908 megawatts in 2009 before selling it to ContourGlobal. \u201cWe have reached a framework to settle Maritsa\u2019s outstanding receivables,\u201d Andres Gluski, AES president and chief executive officer said in a statement. \u201cThis agreement is one component of the Government of Bulgaria\u2019s plan to strengthen the liquidity position of Maritsa\u2019s offtaker, NEK.

Energy shares in the S&P 500 plunged 4 percent as West Texas Intermediate sank to the lowest since April 2009. Exxon Mobil Corp. lost 2.7 percent and Chevron Corp. retreated 4 percent. Caterpillar Inc. declined 5.3 percent and an index of railroad stocks lost 3.2 percent on concern that the energy slump may hurt spending on capital equipment and crude transportation. The S&P 500 dropped 1.8 percent to 2,020.58 for its first four-day losing streak since 2013. The gauge fell below its average price for the last 50 days.

Denbury Resources Inc. sank 7.8 percent and Noble Energy Inc. tumbled 9.6 percent. The gauge of 43 energy producers has plunged 23 percent since an all-time high in June, as oil prices entered a bear market amid a supply glut spurred by the highest U.S. output in three decades and OPEC\u2019s refusal to cut production. Oil declined for a third day today, falling as much as 6.7 percent in London and sinking below $50 a barrel in the U.S. for the first time since April 2009. \u201cIt looks as if oil prices are going to continue to see lower lows in the course of the next couple weeks, and it puts together a risk-off trading environment within the markets,\u201d said Chad Morganlander, a money manager at St. Louis-based Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., which oversees about $160 billion. While cheaper oil has led to a decline in gasoline prices, boosting household purchasing power, concern that it also will curb spending on capital equipment is growing. Evercore ISI cut its ratings on Caterpillar, United Rentals Inc. and Terex Corp., saying the three are most heavily exposed to \u201ccontagion\u201d from lower energy and commodity prices. United Rentals sank 11 percent for the biggest drop in the S&P 500. Caterpillar fell to its lowest level since January 2014, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Ann Duignan downgraded the company to underweight from neutral. She also lowered her rating on Actuant Corp. and Parker-Hannifin Corp., which declined more than 3.2 percent. Already battered by a slump in demand for its mining machinery, Caterpillar faces slowing sales of compressors, pumps and gas turbines as oil companies reduce spending. The shares have lost 7.6 percent since Dec. 26. Its turbines are found on offshore oil rigs while its engines and compressors are used to move oil from wells to pipelines and rail cars. Railroad stocks in the S&P 500 slid 3.2 percent for a fourth day of losses.

It\u2019s the first time strategists have been unanimously bullish since 2009, when stocks surged 23 percent. The S&P 500 capped its first four-day string of losses since December 2013, dropping 3.4 percent over that time period. The gauge never fell more than three straight days in 2014, a first in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2000. It has tripled from its low in March 2009, including its biggest annual rally since 1997 in 2013. Data showed German inflation slowed more than forecast, adding to signs that euro-area inflation is turning negative and potentially bolstering the case for more European Central Bank stimulus. ECB officials are debating whether to expand stimulus to including buying government bonds as plunging oil prices threaten to tip the euro area into a deflationary spiral. Global markets also slumped today amid investor concern Greece might leave the euro region. The country began an election campaign that Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said may lead to an exit from the currency union should the Syriza party win. The euro weakened to an almost nine-year low. \u201cGreece is creeping back into the headlines and it\u2019s an issue for people to pay attention to,\u201d Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab Corp., said by phone from Austin, Texas. \u201cThe market is very close to record highs and we haven\u2019t had a correction since fall of 2011. There\u2019s a lot of potential for a pullback when you\u2019re at these levels.\u201d Investors later this week will evaluate data on U.S. hiring in December and minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last policy meeting at which it pledged patience in raising interest rates even as the economy expands.

The subscriber additions brought the total to 58.9 million users, Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile said in a statement Thursday. Branded new monthly phone users, a measure more closely watched by investors, reached 760,000 in the second quarter, the company said, citing preliminary figures. Customers with T-Mobile\u2019s Simple Choice plan will now get coverage and calling in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. That move may push Sprint, AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. to follow suit even though it could cost the carriers several billion dollars in revenue, according to Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics LLC in Dedham, Massachusetts. \u201cWe\u2019ll see AT&T move ahead with its plan to offer that U.S.-Mexico calling area,\u201d Entner said, referring to the wireless service zone AT&T is building across both countries. In the meantime, AT&T may offer free roaming to its users and that could come \u201cwithin days or weeks,\u201d he said. Sprint, with its \u201cheavy emphasis on Hispanics,\u201d may also try to match the offer, Entner said. Sprint is working on a roaming plan for Canada, and offers a two-week international pass in Mexico starting at $15, spokeswoman Kristin Wallace said in an interview. AT&T spokesman Fletcher Cook declined to comment, as did Verizon spokeswoman Debi Lewis. Under Chief Executive Officer John Legere, T-Mobile has challenged the wireless industry to match its sales offers such as contract buyouts and free music streaming. The company is about 66 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom AG of Germany. T-Mobile shares rose 0.8 percent to $38.77 at the close in New York. It has climbed 44 percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent gain by AT&T and a 1.1 percent drop for Verizon. Earlier this year, AT&T bought NII Holdings Inc.\u2019s   wireless business and the Mexican wireless carrier Grupo Iusacell SA to further its expansion south of the border. \u201cMexican and Canadian carriers are scared senseless by AT&T entering Mexico,\u201d Entner said. \u201cAnd in order to thwart and to blunt AT&T\u2019s entry into Mexico, they basically made an agreement with T-Mobile.\u201d The move could appeal to T-Mobile subscribers, as 59 percent of their international calls already go to Mexico and Canada, the company said. To enable the feature, T-Mobile struck reciprocal agreements with carriers in both countries. Its competitors may have trouble finding similar good deals, Entner said. \u201cThe new arrangements with partners lower our costs,\u201d T-Mobile Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert said in an interview. \u201cFree is our favorite price point.\u201d","timestamp":1436430338.0,"participant_ids":["T:US","S:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-09\/t-mobile-adds-2-1-million-customers-to-narrow-gap-behind-sprint","subject":"T-Mobile Adds 2.1 Million Users, Free Mexico, Canada Roaming"},{"body":" Regulators declined T-Mobile US Inc.\u2019s request for more help to buy airwaves in a 2016 auction that may pit AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., the largest mobile providers, against smaller competitors. The Federal Communications Commission also allocated frequencies for Wi-Fi-like uses backed by Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as it set rules for the government\u2019s auction of airwaves useful for smartphones. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, called the package \u201ca good, balanced logical solution to an incredibly complex, never-tried situation.\u201d Republicans said the decisions may result in electronic interference to mobile phone and other services that might reduce demand for the airwaves, which are expected to raise billions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury. \u201cThe FCC is making it substantially more difficult than it needs to be to have a successful auction,\u201d said Ajit Pai, the senior member of the agency\u2019s Republican minority. The National Association of Broadcasters, a Washington-based trade group whose members include CBS Corp. and Comcast Corp.\u2019s NBC, called the vote \u201ca major setback\u201d in a statement issued by spokesman Dennis Wharton. The rules will bring lower payments to stations offering airwaves for sale at the auction, and will set up interference disputes, Wharton said. The auction will sell frequencies carrying signals that go far and penetrate buildings. The airwaves are to be given up by television stations that will get a cut of auction proceeds. T-Mobile had asked the agency to increase the portion of airwaves set aside, or reserved, for companies other than the largest carriers, saying the change would keep those companies from winning the lion\u2019s share of available frequencies. AT&T and Verizon have said the proposal would protect T-Mobile from competition. The FCC decided not to increase the reserve, Commissioner Mignon Clyburn said in a statement. T-Mobile \u201cis committed to showing up, playing hard and being successful at the auction,\u201d John Legere, its chief executive officer, said in a series of tweets that also called the FCC\u2019s decision a \u201cvictory\u201d and said it will encourage competition. Google and Microsoft had asked the agency to make sure there are airwaves available for Wi-Fi-like devices that can perform tasks such as offering broadband service or remotely monitoring water levels. The agency said that after the auction, the devices can use spaces not occupied by smartphone or TV signals. Wheeler in July said the agency\u2019s proposal would give the devices more space than they currently have. Verizon will wait to look at auction rules before deciding whether to participate, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo told investors July 21. AT&T in 2014 said it intends to participate. Bidding in the auction might pressure cash flow for carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint Corp., T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular, according to a note Thursday by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts John Butler and Matthew Kanterman.","timestamp":1438868211.0,"participant_ids":["GOOGL:US","VZ:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-06\/t-mobile-doesn-t-get-auction-help-as-google-sees-wi-fi-progress","subject":"T-Mobile Doesn\u2019t Get Auction Help as Google Sees Wi-Fi Gain"},{"body":" Statkraft AS, Norway\u2019s state-owned power company, set up a North American environmental-markets business to seek out trading opportunities as volumes rise in programs in California and states in the U.S. Northeast. The company hired Patrick Pfeiffer as managing director of Statkraft U.S. LLC in San Francisco, Stef Peters, head of Statkraft Global Environmental Markets, said Thursday by phone from Amsterdam. The U.S. office will have only one or two people as there\u2019s probably too little business for more right away, said Peters, who also is chairman of the North American unit. California Governor Jerry Brown in April ordered that greenhouse gases be cut to almost half of what they were a quarter-century ago, the most   state-wide effort in the U.S. to combat climate change. California\u2019s carbon market expanded this year to cover transportation fuel and natural gas utilities, almost doubling the volume of emissions covered. \u201cStatkraft is seeking to take advantage of volume increases,\u201d Peters said.  \u201cWe will also explore opportunities from the Environmental Protection Agency rules and from linking different states.\u201d Trading in the California market more than doubled in the first half to 146 million metric tons, according to data from ICE Futures U.S. compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That equates to about eight days of trading in the European Union carbon market, the world\u2019s biggest, where Oslo-based Statkraft already participates. The Canadian province of   plans to link with California\u2019s market, which last year joined up with a carbon program in Quebec. The EPA plans to publish rules in the summer aimed at cutting carbon pollution from power plants by 30 percent by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. Pfeiffer worked previously as director of sales and trading at EOS Climate Inc. He will start at Statkraft on Sept. 8. Trading volumes have been thin for California because it\u2019s oversupplied, Colleen Regan, an analyst in New York with New Energy Finance, said by phone. \u201cAdding Ontario would boost the California-Quebec market by 25 percent in terms of emissions covered,\u201d she said. Statkraft also plans to trade offset credits and allowances under the Regional Greenhouse Gas  , Peters said. In the market for Swedish-Norwegian Renewable Energy Certificates, prices have dropped more than 50 percent since 2008 to the equivalent of about $18 a megawatt-hour, below what\u2019s needed for wind developers to be profitable, said Janis Hoberg, an analyst at New Energy Finance in London. \u201cIn Europe, REC markets are dying a slow death,\u201d including in the U.K., Poland, Italy and Romania, he said. The region is seeking to rely more on its carbon market to cut the cost of climate protection. Benchmark EU allowances rose as much as 1.9 percent Thursday to 8.12 euros ($8.93) a ton, the highest since Nov. 14, 2012, on ICE Futures Europe in London. \u201cThe European carbon market may be leading at the moment, but we expect future developments to take place in the U.S. and in China,\u201d Statkraft\u2019s Peters said.

Drahi\u2019s investment vehicle is buying a 70 percent stake in Suddenlink, the seventh-largest U.S. cable company, Altice said Wednesday. Altice has also made a takeover approach for larger Time Warner Cable Inc., whose takeover by Comcast Corp. was called off last month, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Drahi, 51, is seeking to expand his telecommunications empire to a U.S. cable market that is being quickly reshaped by a series of mergers. Cable providers are trying to get bigger as their traditional business of selling TV service comes under pressure from online rivals. Everything \u201cbelow Comcast effectively is in consolidation mode,\u201d Altice Chief Executive Officer Dexter Goei said on a conference call. \u201cWe clearly expect to be right in the middle of that consolidation.\u201d Last month, Comcast, the nation\u2019s biggest cable company, dropped its plan to buy Time Warner Cable, the No. 2, in the face of regulatory hurdles. Meanwhile, Charter Communications Inc., which ranks fourth, is working on a takeover of Bright House Networks LLC, the No. 6. Many analysts also anticipate a merger between Charter and Time Warner Cable. Shares of Altice rose 11 percent to 127.95 euros at 4 p.m. in Amsterdam. Suddenlink is closely held. Time Warner Cable added 3.2 percent to $163 in New York. Bigger Deal? The purchase values Suddenlink at 9.8 times its projected 2015 earnings, or 27 percent more than the average valuation in cable deals last year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The transaction\u2019s equity value is about $1.7 billion, and it gives Suddenlink an enterprise value of $9.1 billion, Altice said. Suddenlink would give Altice a foothold in the U.S. after a series of deals built it into a large player in Europe\u2019s telecommunications market. Suddenlink, based in St. Louis, has about 1.5 million residential and commercial customers in more than a dozen states, primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina and West Virginia. A purchase of Time Warner Cable, with more than 10 million video customers, would immediately vault Altice into a major force in the U.S. cable market. New York-based Time Warner Cable provides cable-TV, high-speed Internet and voice services to businesses and consumers. Deliberations on a deal for Time Warner Cable are at an early stage and may not result in an agreement, the person with knowledge of the plan said. Time Warner Cable\u2019s market capitalization is about $46 billion, while Altice has a value of $35 billion. Drahi could also face competition from billionaire John Malone to acquire the asset. Advisers for Malone\u2019s Charter have already   to Time Warner Cable to begin talks on an acquisition, people with knowledge of the matter have said. \u201cHe\u2019s a growth guy,\u201d Malone said in a phone interview on Tuesday about Drahi. \u201cHe\u2019s an acquirer, an aggressive acquirer taking advantage of low-cost debt right now and the ability to be pretty aggressive at cutting costs out of what he buys.\u201d Malone is a rival to Drahi in Europe through his Liberty Global Plc cable company. Representatives for Time Warner Cable and Altice declined to comment. Reuters reported the approach earlier Tuesday, citing an unidentified person. The Suddenlink deal marks a second change of ownership of the U.S. company in three years. In 2012, it was   by BC Partners Ltd. and a Canada pension fund for $1.99 billion from a group of investors that included Goldman Sachs Group Inc. BC Partners and the Canadian fund, CPP Investment Board, will now retain 30 percent of Suddenlink. JPMorgan Chase & Co., PJT Partners Inc. and BNP Paribas SA acted as financial advisers to Altice. Franklin, Covington, Mayer Brown and Ropes & Gray acted as legal advisers. Drahi, who splits his time between Paris, Geneva, and Tel Aviv, is expanding to new territory with the Suddenlink purchase. He is a dual French and Israeli citizen whose parents were math teachers and who prefers getting around on a bicycle. Last year, Altice bought French wireless provider SFR and merged it with its own cable operator Numericable. Early this year, Altice was stepping up plans for a potential takeover of smaller mobile carrier Bouygues Telecom to further cement its position in France, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Bouygues SA Chief Executive Officer Martin Bouygues said last month the company\u2019s phone division isn\u2019t for sale. Bouygues shares declined 1.6 percent in Paris. Moroccan-born Drahi\u2019s first cable venture was a tiny operator founded 20 years ago in the village of Cavaillon in southern France. Throughout the 1990s Drahi bought and sold cable companies, deals that eventually led to the creation of Numericable, alongside buyout firm Cinven Group Ltd. Carlyle Group LP invested in 2007 in Numericable, now France\u2019s largest cable provider.","timestamp":1432057243.0,"participant_ids":["ATC:NA","0952681D:US","TWC:US","CMCSA:US","CHTR:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-19\/altice-said-to-seek-purchase-of-suddenlink-in-u-s-expansion","subject":"Altice to Acquire Suddenlink Stake in $9.1 Billion U.S. Deal"},{"body":" Barnes & Noble Inc. named Sears Canada Inc.

Just two years ago, the man who made a fortune building Tele-Communications Inc. into a U.S. broadcasting titan was spending much of his time trying to repeat the trick in Europe through London-based Liberty Global Plc. Yet Tuesday\u2019s $55 billion bid by Malone\u2019s Charter Communications Inc. for Time Warner Cable Inc. shows the 74-year-old billionaire remains eager to grab a leading role in the industry consolidation taking place on both sides of the Atlantic. \u201cThere\u2019s been no one as instrumental as Malone in this business,\u201d said Neil Campling, a senior analyst at Aviate Global in London. \u201cHe\u2019s also a banker at heart and does these deals not because he loves the industry, or there\u2019s a romance there, but because he\u2019s a shrewd businessman.\u201d Should the Time Warner Cable acquisition go ahead, Malone will have come full circle from 15 years ago, when he gave up his number-two spot in U.S. pay-TV by selling TCI to AT&T Inc. Tuesday\u2019s announcement also marks a turnaround from 15 months ago, when Charter\u2019s first offer for Time Warner Cable was trumped by a $45 billion bid from Comcast Corp. --  last month amid antitrust concerns. Losing out to Comcast was considered a big blow to Malone after he tiptoed back into the U.S. cable waters in 2013 by becoming the biggest shareholder in Charter. It was also his second defeat that year after losing out to Vodafone Group Plc on a 7.7 billion-euro ($8.4 billion) bid for Germany\u2019s Kabel Deutschland Holding AG. Tuesday\u2019s bid at $195.71 a share, 14 percent more than Time Warner Cable\u2019s May 22 close, would catapult Charter from the fourth-largest cable company to the No. 2 slot behind Comcast. The deal will let Charter almost quadruple its cable subscribers, gaining 12 million customers in cities including New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. It\u2019s also agreed to buy Bright House Networks LLC, the sixth-largest cable company,and will merge it into the combined entity. The pursuit of Time Warner Cable was lent urgency after Patrick Drahi, a former Malone protege, emerged as a rival looking to snap up U.S. assets. Drahi\u2019s Luxembourg-based Altice SA last week bought smaller U.S. cable provider Suddenlink Communications and was said to be in talks with Time Warner Cable. \u201cDrahi is an aggressive cost-cutter and his presence forced Malone to move quicker than later,\u201d said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities in Denver, Malone\u2019s home town. \u201cThey wanted to lock this down.\u201d While cable faces an uncertain future because of the emergence of Internet competitors such as Netflix Inc., Malone and Drahi are willing to finance large deals because they believe cable networks will be crucial in delivering large amounts of content at high speed. \u201cThis deal is all about the pipeline,\u201d said Campling at Aviate, \u201cand in areas where broadband Internet and fibre has not been rolled out cable offers some of the best speeds.\u201d Shares in Time Warner Cable rose 4 percent to $177.98 as of 11:23 a.m. in New York. Charter fell 1.6 percent to $172.61. Malone has also signaled a desire to pursue large deals in Europe through Liberty Global, saying last week that he thought Vodafone\u2019s mobile phone assets in western Europe would be a \u201c .\u201d Liberty Global is the world\u2019s biggest cable company with 27 million subscribers, followed by Comcast\u2019s 22.4 million and Time Warner Cable\u2019s 11 million, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Charter currently has about 4.3 million subscribers. With a net worth of $8.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Malone started in the cable industry in 1972 when he helped former cottonseed salesman Bob Magness transform TCI. After selling the company to AT&T, he ramped up investment in British satellite-TV and cable operations and started Liberty Global in the mid-2000s. He ventured back into U.S. cable in May 2013 by paying $2.6 billion for a 27 percent stake in Charter. He\u2019s also the U.S.\u2019s largest private landowner and has been buying up hotels and private land in Ireland in recent years.

The providers haven\u2019t been able to pass those increases through to subscribers as quickly. \u201cThe cable companies are much, much cheaper,\u201d Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research in New York, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe content companies have had all the pricing power.\u201d The business of creating TV shows will always be sexier than selling cable subscriptions. And content companies are less capital-intensive than cable operators, pushing their valuations higher because they can return more cash to shareholders. But their inequality in the stock market may start to diminish. For one, cable operators are trying to reinvent themselves as broadband Internet providers, which is a more lucrative business. That should help their valuations catch up with the content companies, Chaplin said. Content producers, such as Viacom Inc. and Walt Disney Co., may also be at risk of losing revenue as pay-TV providers begin to feature   of channels to reduce customers\u2019 bills. Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s FiOS announced last month it would offer a Custom TV service that has a base package of just 35 channels. Additional channels are tiered based on genre. If consumers don\u2019t want them -- say, sports or kids programming -- they can opt out and not pay for those. This may hurt distribution for channels such as Viacom\u2019s Nickelodeon or Disney\u2019s ESPN, which generate revenue based on how many households get the channel. ESPN is   Verizon, claiming the new packaging method violates its licensing agreement. Further, the amount of content available through online services such as Netflix Inc. has boosted the willingness of cable distributors to drop channels that aren\u2019t deemed must-have. These online services don\u2019t pay programmers nearly as much for on-demand library content as pay-TV providers may for live-streaming channels. Finally, if Charter\u2019s deal for Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks goes through, a much larger No. 2 cable provider will emerge. More consolidation in the industry is expected as Altice SA has publicly expressed its desire to get bigger beyond its $9.1 billion acquisition of Suddenlink Communications, the seventh-largest cable provider, earlier this month. As cable providers combine, they\u2019ll gain more leverage against their content counterparts and have more power to push back on price increases from programmers. There is still one way content companies could maintain their lead in the stock market: Fees from up-and-coming streaming services such as those offered by Sony Corp. and Apple Inc. Because these aren\u2019t yet proven models with the promise of drawing heaps of subscribers, they\u2019ll have to pay up just to be able to offer the content. Content providers are also benefiting from takeover speculation. Talk of a deal for  , the owner of HGTV and the Food Network, and AMC Networks, the creator of \u201cMad Men\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d intensified last year after larger rival Time Warner   a takeover offer from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox. On the cable side, smaller operators are also rising amid the industry\u2019s recent consolidation, even if they haven\u2019t caught up to content companies.   has surged on speculation that Altice could bid for the $7 billion company. Dish Network Corp. has also propped up the group because the satellite-TV provider owns valuable wireless spectrum. \u201cThere\u2019s so much deal speculation embedded in a lot of these stocks that it obscures fundamentals,\u201d Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a phone interview. \u201cExpectations have become so overheated.\u201d","timestamp":1432752701.0,"participant_ids":["TWC:US","CHTR:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-27\/tale-of-two-time-warners-spurs-cable-vs-content-debate-real-m-a","subject":"Tale of Two Time Warners Spurs Cable vs Content Debate: Real M&A"},{"body":" Billionaire Patrick Drahi offered to buy Bouygues SA\u2019s wireless carrier in a proposal said to be valued at about 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion), setting up another faceoff with Martin Bouygues in just over a year. The bid for Bouygues Telecom was made by Numericable-SFR, the cable and mobile-phone unit of Drahi\u2019s Altice SA holding company, Luxembourg-based Altice said Monday. Bouygues called the offer unsolicited and said no negotiations are under way. Its board will meet Tuesday to evaluate the proposal. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said the timing \u201cisn\u2019t right\u201d for further consolidation in the French phone market. While informal discussions have been taking place for months, Drahi, who   in a bidding war for SFR, decided to move quickly as he\u2019s concerned that possible interest-rate increases and market volatility due to   may make it more costly to finance a takeover, people familiar with the matter said. Numericable-SFR shares jumped as much as 18 percent in Paris trading. Bouygues surged 14 percent at 12:07 p.m. local time. Rival Iliad SA added 12 percent and Orange SA rose 7.4 percent. Altice gained 21 percent in Amsterdam. A combination of Numericable-SFR and Bouygues would create a company with more than 30 million wireless subscribers, potentially overtaking Orange to become the market leader by mobile customer numbers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The merged entity\u2019s annual revenue would top 15 billion euros. Still, Drahi has to win over billionaire Martin Bouygues. The Bouygues chief executive officer, 63, said last month in a letter to Investir magazine that he had decided against selling the division, which is the third-largest wireless carrier in France. A 10 billion-euro bid implies a valuation of 14.4 times 12-month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the highest among industry deals in Europe in the past 2 1\/2 years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Erhan Gurses. Raymond James analysts Stephane Beyazian and Thibault de Coincy put the chances of success for the bid at 50 percent to 60 percent, citing antitrust risks. Iliad, which is controlled by Xavier Niel, said it\u2019s in exclusive talks with Numericable-SFR to acquire some assets. The negotiations, over network infrastructure and wireless frequencies, are aimed at alleviating regulatory concerns, said people familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A merger of Numericable-SFR with Bouygues Telecom would reduce the number of national network providers to three from four. Drahi is returning his focus to Europe after Altice agreed to acquire control of U.S. cable provider Suddenlink Communications in a deal valued at more than $9 billion last month. The billionaire continues to seek out assets to expand his telecommunications empire that stretches from France, Israel and Portugal to the Caribbean. Drahi has secured financing for the Bouygues Telecom bid, the people said. The offer would be paid in cash, with a loan from banks including BNP Paribas SA and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the people said. Telecommunications and cable companies are consolidating and taking advantage of cheap financing as they face increasing pressure to maintain profit growth. In May, Charter Communications Inc. agreed to buy Time Warner Cable Inc. for about $55 billion -- a deal made more expensive by last-minute competition from Drahi. The French tycoon eventually said Altice   because it wasn\u2019t ready for an acquisition of that size. Any deal for Bouygues Telecom is likely to face scrutiny from regulators, as well as potential resistance from the French government. \u201cConsolidation isn\u2019t advisable for the sector,\u201d Economy Minister Macron said on Sunday, after Journal du Dimanche reported the offer. \u201cEmployment, investment and giving customers the best possible service should be the priority.\u201d Some 3,000 jobs may be cut as a result of a takeover of Bouygues Telecom by Numericable-SFR, an official from the CFDT union said in an interview on BFM TV. Just last week, the European Union\u2019s top antitrust official, Margrethe Vestager,   she may take a tougher stance than her predecessor on the wave of mergers among telecommunications companies. Regulators will likely require the enlarged entity to sell some assets for the deal to be approved, one of the people said. SFR, Bouygues, Iliad and Orange discussed a similar plan late last year before talks fell apart, the people said. That preparation helped Drahi move faster this time, they said. Orange isn\u2019t part of any talks or deals at this point, but is open to discussions about consolidation in France, said a spokesman for the country\u2019s biggest phone company. The French phone carriers will also have to reassure the country\u2019s government that they will bid in the upcoming 700 megahertz spectrum auction to allow the state to raise its budgeted revenue from that sale, the people said.","timestamp":1434942494.0,"participant_ids":["ATC:NA","ILD:FP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-22\/billionaire-drahi-s-altice-makes-offer-for-bouygues-telecom","subject":"Drahi Makes Bid for Bouygues Telecom Said to Top $11 Billion"},{"body":" Citigroup Inc., the fourth-ranked adviser on global technology deals this year, hired David Locala from Deutsche Bank AG to strengthen its mergers and acquisitions practice.

Waldman is trying to jump ahead of competitors such as Intel Corp. and Broadcom Corp. by selling data-center switches that can move information at the fastest speed in the industry, according to Stifel Nicolaus & Co. \u201cThey\u2019re using the right strategy,\u201d said Kevin Cassidy, a Washington-based Stifel analyst. \u201cRather than coming in at the same speed as everyone else, they\u2019re entering the market at the high end.\u201d Mellanox\u2019s earnings have mostly been driven by server upgrades for   that use processors made by Intel. Data-center owners like Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. replace their hardware when Intel -- which has more than 98 percent of the market -- brings out an improved version of its Xeon chips. The companies usually replace supporting equipment, including Mellanox products. Most of Mellanox\u2019s rally this year is tied to Intel\u2019s latest server upgrade, known as Grantley, said Srini Nandury, an analyst at Summit Research Partners in Summit, New Jersey. The upgrade is fueling demand for Mellanox InfiniBand products, which direct the flow of data-center information. Shares of the Yokneam Elit, Israel-based company have rallied 18 percent this year to $50.33 That compares with an 8.8 percent gain in the Nasdaq Composite Index and a 6.1 percent increase in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. The Bloomberg Israel-US index and TA-25 Index are up 11 percent and 16 percent year-to-date, as of 9:55 a.m. in New York.

Lior Suchard, an Israeli mentalist who has   Larry King, Jay Leno and Kim Kardashian with his ability to read minds, entertained a crowd of mostly male industry analysts, clients from companies such as International Business Machines Corp., and Mellanox engineers flown over from Israel. He laced his performance with plugs for the company\u2019s new switches. Mellanox\u2019s first-quarter earnings beat analysts\u2019 estimates, and revenue is forecast to climb 37 percent this year to $635 million, and 12 percent in 2016, according to the average estimate of 12 analysts. Potential revenue from sales of the new Ethernet cards and switches Mellanox unveiled last week won\u2019t materialize until at least 2016, Nandury said. And Mellanox\u2019s headstart doesn\u2019t mean competitors are out of the picture. \u201cIt\u2019s great that they can execute on the road map, that they\u2019re executing on the product side, but the market still has to catch up,\u201d the Summit Research analyst said. Intel\u2019s server upgrade for supercomputers should drive Mellanox sales for another three or four quarters, according to Nandury, who has a buy rating on the shares and a $60 price target. About half of the 15 analysts covering Mellanox recommend buying the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mellanox\u2019s reliance on the Intel upgrade still makes some analysts skeptical. The company trades at 20 times 12-month future earnings, compared with an industry average of 18. James Kisner, an analyst with Jefferies LLC in San Francisco who has a hold rating on the stock, wrote in a June 17 report that his firm is waiting for \u201cmore evidence that Mellanox is making significant progress in driving adoption of its Ethernet switches.\u201d Mellanox has also rallied amid a   for mergers and acquisitions in the chipmaking industry.

Deliberations on a deal are at an early stage and may not result in an agreement, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Time Warner Cable\u2019s market capitalization is about $45 billion, while Altice has a value of $34 billion. Drahi, 51, is seeking to expand his telecommunications empire to a U.S. cable market that is being quickly reshaped by a series of mergers. Altice, Drahi\u2019s holding company, said on Wednesday it   most of Suddenlink Communications in a deal that values the seventh-largest U.S. cable company at $9.1 billion including debt. Representatives for Time Warner Cable and Altice declined to comment. Reuters reported the approach earlier Tuesday, citing an unidentified person. Shares of Altice rose 7.3 percent to 124 euros at 9:08 a.m. in Amsterdam. Time Warner Cable added 0.3 percent to $158 in New York on Tuesday. Altice is buying 70 percent of Suddenlink to add about 1.5 million customers in states including Texas, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas and Arizona. BC Partners and CPP Investment Board will retain a 30 percent stake in Suddenlink. Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable company, dropped its plan to buy Time Warner Cable, the No. 2, in the face of regulatory hurdles. Meanwhile, Charter Communications Inc., which ranks fourth, is working on a takeover of Bright House Networks LLC, the No. 6. Many analysts also anticipate a merger between Charter and Time Warner Cable. Drahi, who splits his time between Paris, Geneva, and Tel Aviv, is among the most influential telecommunications tycoons in Europe. The U.S. would mark new territory for the billionaire, a dual French and Israeli citizen whose parents were math teachers and who prefers getting around on a bicycle. Last year, Altice bought French wireless provider SFR and merged it with its own cable operator Numericable, predicting   valued at more than 10 billion euros from the deal. The combined Numericable-SFR reported a 5 percent slide in 2014 revenue, underscoring the need to reduce expenses following the merger as prices drop in the highly competitive French market. Early this year, Altice was stepping up plans for a potential takeover of smaller mobile carrier Bouygues Telecom to further cement its position in France, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Bouygues SA Chief Executive Officer Martin Bouygues said last month the company\u2019s phone division isn\u2019t for sale. Moroccan-born Drahi\u2019s first cable venture was a tiny operator founded 20 years ago in the village of Cavaillon in southern France. Throughout the 1990s Drahi bought and sold cable companies, deals that eventually led to the creation of Numericable, alongside buyout firm Cinven Group Ltd. Carlyle Group LP invested in 2007 in Numericable, now France\u2019s largest cable provider.","timestamp":1432076171.0,"participant_ids":["TWC:US","ATC:NA","0952681D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-20\/time-warner-cable-said-to-receive-takeover-approach-from-altice","subject":"Time Warner Cable Said to Get Takeover Approach From Altice"},{"body":"EZchip Semiconductor Ltd., whose $811 million takeover by Mellanox Technologies Ltd. has been challenged by activist investors, rallied after the company said it would delay a vote on the deal to shop itself around to other potential buyers. Mellanox,\u00a0whose products power data-crunching supercomputers, reaffirmed its offer of $25.50 per share and sent a letter to EZchip requesting amendments to the merger agreement to allow EZchip a 30-day \u201cgo-shop\u201d period, as well as a postponement of a vote on the deal scheduled for today. Shares of EZchip rose 2.6 percent to $24.55 at 12:38 p.m. in New York, the biggest gain in six weeks. Mellanox added 0.5 percent to $46.57. Activist hedge fund Raging Capital Management, which owns 6.7 percent of EZchip, has nominated two dissident directors and urged shareholders to vote against the deal, arguing that Mellanox\u2019s offer was a \u201clow-ball price\u201d and that EZchip failed to\u00a0\u201crun a fair and competitive sales process.\u201d Mellanox\u2019s affirmation of its offer price spurred a rally in EZchip shares because it allayed concern that the deal would fall apart, said Steve Bierker, a trader and analyst at Muhlenkamp & Co. which manages about $450 million, including EZchip shares. \u201cYou kind of get a free put option on the shares because Mellanox has reaffirmed their interest in the deal, while giving EZchip time to shop around,\u201d Muhlenkamp said by phone from Pittsburgh. \u201cThere\u2019s very limited downside in the deal, and potential upside.\u201d Mellanox Chief Executive Officer Eyal Waldman   last month that the merger was driven by the need for more innovation to develop a system-on-a-chip.

The risk of losing Cisco revenue in 2018 made EZchip a cheaper target for Mellanox, Benchmark Co LLC said at the time. Yokneam, Israel-based EZchip reported adjusted net income of $11.5 million on Nov. 5, less than the $11.7 million average estimate of two analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. EZchip forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $25 million, well below the $33.2 million analyst estimate, due to adjustments \u201cacross several key customers.\u201d Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an influential adviser on corporate governance, recommended shareholders vote in favor of the merger in an Oct. 31 report.

While 66 percent of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners surveyed had signed up for Apple Pay, repeat usage is being hurt, the study by   said. Almost half of users visited a store listed as an Apple Pay merchant only to find they couldn\u2019t use the service because the location wasn\u2019t actually accepting the system or wasn\u2019t ready to do so, according to the survey, which drew about 3,000 respondents. \u201cThey\u2019ve created demand, but it can\u2019t be fulfilled,\u201d Greg Weed, Phoenix\u2019s director of card research, said in an interview. \u201cTo make it more difficult to use or to create any uncertainty in your customer base as to whether it\u2019s going to work is just going to slow it down.\u201d Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is relying on the new system to help expand Apple\u2019s reach by offering new services for iPhone users.

At stake is a   that\u2019s likely to process $67 billion worth of sales this year, according to Forrester Research. Apple declined to comment on the survey, which was conducted at the end of February, four months after Apple Pay was introduced. Apple Pay, which uses short-range wireless signals known as near-field communication, essentially turns an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus into a digital wallet. The system works only at stores that have upgraded their cash registers to accept chip-embedded credit cards. It\u2019s now supported by 2,500 banks in the U.S. and about 700,000 locations accept it, Cook said this month. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten off to the most amazing start,\u201d Cook said at an event to unveil features of the company\u2019s Apple Watch. Samsung Electronics Co. earlier this month   its own mobile-transaction system, Samsung Pay, which will be available in the third quarter in the U.S. and South Korea. The technology works at checkout terminals that use older, magnetic-stripe technology, as well as NFC. Google Inc., which already has a mobile wallet, has also said it plans to expand in the business and is working on a new service called Android Pay. The average Apple Pay user made 2.6 in-store transactions using the system in its first four months, the survey by Rhinebeck, New York-based Phoenix found. Almost half used it to purchase something inside an Apple store, while almost a third used it at Macy\u2019s Inc. Thirty-six percent of Apple Pay customers used it at McDonald\u2019s Corp. The majority of people who used Apple Pay said they did so because it was faster than a traditional credit card. Almost 60 percent they were using it because \u201cit\u2019s new, stylish or cool,\u201d while 58 percent said they thought it was safer than a normal credit card. About half of users said it was good for medium-sized purchases. Of the problems that occurred at merchants, 48 percent of those surveyed said it took too long to record the transaction, while 42 percent said the cashier was unfamiliar with Apple Pay and unable to help. Other complaints included transactions that incorrectly posted, or were counted twice. The complaints are just some of the challenges Apple faces as it brings out a new payment system. Apple Pay has also been hit by fraud. Some banks have made changes in how they activate customers\u2019 credit-card accounts after reports that criminals were typing stolen credit-card numbers into Apple Pay and trying to make purchases with their iPhones. Some issuers have found that up to 8 percent of Apple Pay transactions were fraudulent, compared with 0.1 percent on traditional payments cards, said Julie Conroy, an analyst at Aite Group. Still, Apple iPhone 6 users have been eager to load their credit cards onto their new phones, according to the biggest U.S. card issuers and networks. More than 800,000 Bank of America Corp. customers have loaded 1.1 million cards onto Apple Pay, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. has said that there\u2019s been \u201cgood growth\u201d in the number of cards its customers are loading, particularly among younger customers who have a higher income. Visa Inc., the world\u2019s biggest payments network, said that 43 banks, representing 75 percent of volume on its U.S. network, have enrolled to use the token system on iPhones to authenticate purchases. \u201cPeople are seeking out places to use Apple Pay,\u201d said Bill Gajda, head of innovation and strategic partnerships at Visa, at an investor conference. \u201cWe like the uptake particularly given the acceptance gap.\u201d The lack of merchant locations and terminals not working were also cited as top issues by repeat Apple Pay users in a separate   released Monday by Citi Research. Sixty percent of Google Wallet users in the same survey cited no issues or concerns. Thirty-two percent complained about limited Google Wallet merchant locations. A new U.S. standard is requiring that merchants and banks switch from a card system using magnetic stripes toward chips because the technology is more effective at preventing fraud. While the deadline for that conversion is in October, only about a third of U.S. cash registers had been converted at the end of last year, a figure expected to rise to a half by the end of 2015, according to data from\u00a0an industry group. The cost to banks and retailers to upgrade their systems to EMV chip technology -- named for developers of the technology, EuroPay International, MasterCard and Visa -- has been part of why it\u2019s taken so long to come to the U.S. While recent data breaches like the one at Target Corp. have provided a catalyst for the conversation, retailers and banks continue to be at odds over whether chip cards should require customers to enter a PIN or their signature to authenticate the card. Anything that slows down the EMV conversion is likely to make it more difficult for Apple Pay customers to find places to use the device. \u201cApple is riding on this EMV wave and they are beholden to a glacial speed of progression because nothing changes overnight in payments,\u201d said  , a payments analyst at Javelin Strategy & Research.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating -- for Apple and Apple Pay users.\u201d","timestamp":1427792400.0,"participant_ids":["AAPL:US","005930:KS"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-31\/apple-pay-running-into-hurdles-at-checkout-counter-survey-finds-i7x95shl","subject":"Apple Pay Running Into Hurdles at Checkout Counter, Survey Finds"},{"body":" Google Inc. has been trying to make its mark in mobile payments since 2011 without much success.

The company, whose card-deck-sized devices are used by small businesses such as street-market vendors and neighborhood beauticians, completed the funding round led by existing investors Intel Capital and Zouk Capital, according to Jacob de Geer, iZettle\u2019s founder and chief executive officer. The funding gives the five-year-old startup a valuation of about $500 million, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the details aren\u2019t public. De Geer declined to comment on company valuation. IZettle Advance is the startup\u2019s first venture away from processing card payments, allowing the Stockholm-based company to help customers access needed capital that banks aren\u2019t always willing to supply and tap into the booming market for alternative lending. Advance offers loans to merchants that are repaid through a portion of sales processed by the iZettle device. \u201cThese smaller businesses are excluded from the existing financial ecosystem,\u201d\u00a0de Geer said in a telephone interview. \u201cBanks aren\u2019t too keen to help these guys out with credit or loans.\u201d Representatives for Intel Capital and Zouk Capital couldn\u2019t immediately be reached to comment on the valuation.

The stock plunged 24 percent to $14.84 in New York Wednesday. Trading volume of 2.1 million shares was more than 23 times the three-month average. In Tel Aviv, the shares closed 0.5 percent higher after sliding 26 percent Wednesday. Cisco plans to develop its own chip for the next generation of a component used in its routing platform, which recently began shipping with EZchip\u2019s NP-5 network processor, the Israeli chipmaker said in its first-quarter earnings report. Revenue will probably start being affected after three years, the time needed to bring a newly developed chip into production, the company said. \u201cWhen a big client like Cisco is switching to making its own chips and thus becoming not a customer but a competitor, this is a really big deal,\u201d Jay Srivatsa, the director of equity research at Chardan Capital Markets LLC who has a hold rating on the stock, said by phone from San Francisco Wednesday. \u201cEZchip will probably have a hard time offsetting the revenue loss.\u201d Cisco is EZchip\u2019s biggest customer. Sales to the San Jose, California-based company, the world\u2019s biggest maker of network routers and switches, accounted for 35 percent of first-quarter revenue, EZchip said in a conference call Wednesday. On a scale from 1 to 5, EZchip\u2019s New York-traded stock has a consensus analyst rating of 3.3, the fourth-lowest among 16 global peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Five out of six analysts advise clients to hold the stock. One assigns a buy rating, down from a peak of eight in March 2013. Analysts have been backpedaling from their bullish calls after Juniper Networks Inc., then the company\u2019s second-largest customer, began using in-house   to EZchip\u2019s processors in 2012.

However, it would only be temporary. It\u2019s hard to imagine why it would maintain a listing beyond\u201d the time-frame proposed, he said.

Taiwan Semiconductor, the world\u2019s biggest custom-chipmaker, plans record spending on plants and equipment this year. It\u2019s   $12 billion on factories -- more than Intel Corp. has ever spent in a year -- to counter investments that Samsung is making to win chip orders from Apple, Qualcomm Inc. and its own handset division. \u201cThe increase by TSMC is a response to Samsung,\u201d said  , an analyst at Gartner Inc. in Santa Clara, California. While Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung is ahead for now in production technology, its Taiwanese rival \u201cis moving aggressively.\u201d The spending is a boon for suppliers such as Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Research Corp. in the U.S. and ASML Holding NV in Europe, according to supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg. Applied Materials, the largest maker of chip equipment, gets a third of its revenue from TSMC and Samsung. Globally, suppliers\u2019 sales rose 19 percent last year to $38 billion and may   this year, estimates from industry group SEMI show. The rush for smartphones, and the tools to make parts for them, is one reflection of economic growth prospects in the U.S. -- forecast to lead the G7 countries for the next two years -- and in China, where even reduced estimates of 7 percent expansion is about five times that of the euro zone. For the quarter that ended in December, Apple     rose 46 percent to 74.5 million units, putting it just behind Samsung\u2019s phone businesses at 75.1 million, according to IDC. \u201cThat\u2019s the No. 1 thing that drives our business, and it\u2019s the key competitive battleground for our customers,\u201d  Applied Materials Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said in an interview. \u201cThat battle is still playing itself out.\u201d To keep enticing consumers, new phones need more powerful, and more power-efficient, brains. That\u2019s where chipmakers come in, and why TSMC and Samsung are locked in an increasingly expensive battle to be first with new production technology. By shrinking the circuit lines on semiconductors -- measured in nanometers -- manufacturers can improve chip capabilities or get more out of a production run. Modern plants cost more than $5 billion to build and equip and are obsolete in five years or less, so they need to operate 24 hours a day. The tables can turn quickly. Samsung had been the supplier of the most important chip in Apple\u2019s iPhone since its debut in 1997. That changed in the iPhone 6 with Apple\u2019s A8 chips, which are manufactured by Hsinchu, Taiwan-based TSMC. Now the South Korean chipmaker is trying to leapfrog TSMC in production technology to win the next round. UBS AG estimates Samsung made $3.7 billion in capital expenditures on its processor business alone in 2014 and may raise that to $4.9 billion this year. Samsung doesn\u2019t disclose such numbers, but executives on a Jan. 29 conference call confirmed they will boost the spending this year. \u201cSamsung is in the lead because they\u2019ve bet the farm on it,\u201d said Len Jelinek, an analyst at IHS Corp. \u201cThey\u2019ve had to.\u201d Founded in 1987, TSMC forged a business model that lets chipmakers like Qualcomm and Broadcom Corp. forgo expensive factories and outsource production of chips using their designs to facilities in Taiwan. Its annual revenue from the communications category more than doubled to $14 billion in five years, now accounting for more than half of sales. For Taiwan\u2019s biggest company, which gets an average of $8 in chip sales for every smartphone sold globally, keeping its factories equipped with the most advanced technology is important to compete with Samsung as well as other rivals including Globalfoundries Inc. and Intel, which recently entered the business of making chips for other companies. TSMC, Intel and Samsung\u2019s processor businesses will account for around 60 percent of total spending on semiconductor equipment this year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on estimates from UBS and industry group  . Santa Clara, California-based Applied Materials gets about 21 percent of its revenue from TSMC and 12 percent from Samsung, according to the supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg. Lam Research, based in Fremont, California, gets about 37 percent of its sales from the two Asian companies. In 2014, share prices rose about 46 percent for Lam Research and 41 percent for Applied Materials, outpacing an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index. Like Apple, other U.S. companies buy from, rather than sell to, TSMC. The Taiwanese company\u2019s biggest customer is Qualcomm, a San Diego-based designer of mobile-phone processors and modems that accounts for about 22 percent of TSMC\u2019s revenue. Apple makes up about 8.2 percent, the data show. ASML Holding, based in the Netherlands, gets more than a third of its revenue from Samsung, with TSMC pitching in more than 8 percent. With Samsung and TSMC raising spending to add capacity, one of the two companies may be making bets that won\u2019t pay off. While TSMC is boosting spending by as much 25 percent this year from $9.5 billion last year, it\u2019s forecasting only a 5 percent rise in chip-industry sales and 12 percent for the custom foundry business. That suggests it intends to win market share. \u201cWe don\u2019t build capacity on speculation,\u201d Morris Chang, TSMC\u2019s 83-year-old founder and chairman, told investors Jan. 15, predicting his company will outgrow the broader foundry sector by a few percentage points this year. \u201cWe build capacity when we know that it\u2019s already sold.\u201d Samsung expressed similar confidence on a conference call with investors, saying its investment slated for the second half of 2015 \u201cis already backed up by customers.\u201d It dominates in memory chips, making it the world\u2019s second-biggest semiconductor maker behind Intel. Because Samsung is also the biggest phonemaker -- therefore a direct rival to other potential customers -- it\u2019s even more important for its production technology to be a must-have. The big budget announcements by TSMC and Samsung haven\u2019t yet translated into a flood of orders for chip equipment. Applied Materials said orders from foundries fell in the three months ended Jan. 25. The company expects that pattern to reverse in the second half of the year as the chipmakers work their way through the difficulties of shifting to more advanced production, Applied\u2019s CEO said. There\u2019s another potential risk for chipmakers and, by extension, their suppliers. Apple wants to move production of chips for its phones to a so-called 14 nanometer process -- tighter circuitry than TSMC\u2019s current 20 nanometers -- while other companies won\u2019t need such advanced capabilities so quickly, according to Gartner\u2019s Wang. With manufacturers building leading-edge capacity for so few clients, the result may be a glut of 14-nanometer capacity, leading to \u201cfierce price competition,\u201d he said. That would help boost profit at Apple, which spent $25.8 billion on chips last year, accounting for 7.6 percent of industrywide purchases, according to Gartner. The top two PC makers, Lenovo Group Ltd. and Hewlett-Packard Co., spent a combined $27.5 billion. While Apple is the main prize, Samsung\u2019s phone-making division, along with rivals like Lenovo and Xiaomi Corp., are looking for better-performing parts themselves as they try to take on the iPhone. \u201cAll of these guys are racing to be on the leading edge of technology with their phones,\u201d IHS\u2019s Jelinek said. \u201cTSMC are going to come forward and say we\u2019re going to spend whatever it takes to win that next business. Right now they\u2019re behind Samsung.\u201d","timestamp":1424116800.0,"participant_ids":["005930:KS","AAPL:US","AMAT:US","LRCX:US","INTC:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-16\/booming-u-s-seen-with-taiwan-buoying-applied-materials-to-lam","subject":"The Price of Getting Apple\u2019s Attention: $12 Billion"},{"body":"Credit Suisse Group AG hired Andreas Arni to head a new unit that focuses on entrepreneurs as it expands the business of managing money for the wealthy.

The dollar is on track for its longest weekly losing streak since October 2013, amid signs the U.S. economy is struggling to gather strength, bolstering the case for keeping interest rates lower for longer. A weaker dollar lessens the drag on the economy and corporate profits as exports become more competitive and imports less attractive to consumers.

Revenue in the three months ending in July will rise 2 percent to 6 percent from the previous period, the semiconductor-equipment maker said Thursday in a statement. That indicates sales of as much as $2.59 billion, compared with an average analyst estimate of $2.52 billion. Demand from computer-memory chipmakers is helping drive orders for Applied Materials\u2019 products, helping blunt concerns about the company\u2019s ability to expand on its own after the failure of its bid for Japan\u2019s Tokyo Electron. Santa Clara, California-based Applied Materials, the largest maker of machinery used to manufacture computer chips, was thwarted by regulatory opposition in its plan to use the combination to grow and become more efficient. \u201cDRAM has been the driver, especially in the first half of the year,\u201d said Patrick Ho, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. He recommends buying the stock. \u201cFrom a secular growth story, it\u2019s still intact. The combination would have accelerated the growth.\u201d Applied Materials\u2019 shares rose 1.7 percent to close at $20.20 on Friday in New York, leaving the stock down 19 percent this year. Investors use orders at Applied Materials and its peers as an indicator of the confidence in future demand for electronics, because chipmakers order machinery multiple quarters in advance of when they think they\u2019ll need it. The company received orders of $2.52 billion in the quarter, a gain of 11 percent from the preceding three months and a decline of 4 percent from a year ago. The company is gaining market share by providing new techniques to chipmakers who are finding it increasingly difficult to improve their production technology, Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said in a telephone interview. That\u2019s helping insulate his company\u2019s order book from swings in end-market demand and cuts in spending by companies such as Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining significant market share,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good part of the market. We\u2019re in the early innings in terms of these transitions.\u201d Net income in the second quarter, which ended on April 26, rose 39 percent to $364 million, or 29 cents a share, from $262 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue climbed 3.8 percent to $2.44 billion. Analysts on average had projected net income of 25 cents and sales of $2.4 billion. Applied Materials is also the largest maker of equipment used to manufacture flat-panel displays, helping diversify its revenue sources. The move to larger-screen televisions has helped fuel demand for more capable machinery in that industry. Last month, Applied said it dropped its $9.39 billion bid for Tokyo Electron, first announced in September 2013, after opposition from the U.S. Department of Justice. Proposed remedies from the two suppliers weren\u2019t enough to allay the government\u2019s concerns about the potential impact on competition, the company said.","timestamp":1431623483.0,"participant_ids":["AMAT:US","8035:JP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-14\/applied-materials-forecast-eases-concerns-after-deal-failure","subject":"Applied Materials Forecast Eases Concerns After Deal Failure"},{"body":"Micron Technology Inc. agreed to buy the rest of Inotera Memories Inc. it doesn\u2019t already own for $3.2 billion excluding cash and debt, the latest consolidation in the global semiconductor market.

Thursday\u2019s ruling by the Court of Appeals in Albany rejected a challenge by fleet operators to the project, which will replace most of the 13,000 yellow cabs with the $29,700 Nissan NV200, with its sliding doors, extra luggage space and air bags in back. Nissan in 2011 won the 10-year contract as part of the city\u2019s \u201cTaxi of Tomorrow\u201d plan. \u201cThe Nissan NV200 taxi provides a vehicle that is optimal in safety, comfort and convenience for passengers and drivers alike,\u201d Travis Parman, a Nissan spokesman, said in an e-mail.

The NV200 won\u2019t be entirely new to harried New Yorkers. More than 700 of them now roam city streets. While cab owners can buy other vehicles that meet specifications, the taxi commission wants the NV200 to represent as much as 80 percent of its fleet, spokesman Allan Fromberg said in an interview. The vehicle is more tailored to the city\u2019s roads than any prior cab, said Parman. It\u2019s the only taxi to be safety-tested with a partition installed, and its air bags are superior, he said. The cab is wheelchair accessible. \u201cThis is a good outcome that will enable us to expand this use of a modern vehicle, designed with safety, health and comfort in mind,\u201d Taxi and Limousine Commissioner Meera Joshi said in a statement.

Yesterday, 23 law firms announced they had hired a total of 43 new lawyers. Most of the changes occurred in the U.S., with the exception of Greenberg Traurig LLP, which said it was opening an office in Tokyo with one lawyer from DLA Piper LLP and two from White & Case LLP. There was no pattern, and the only certainty is that these are first of what is likely to be a spate of individual, as well as group, lateral moves. Three attorneys with longstanding experience in bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations are joining Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP in its Washington office. H. Jason Gold, Valerie Morrison, and Dylan Trache previously were partners at Wiley Rein LLP, which in November announced it was closing its bankruptcy practice. White & Case has hired Michael Lebovitz and Stephen Weerts for its global tax practice as partners in its Los Angeles office. The two lawyers, who were previously partners at DLA Piper, will work with the firm\u2019s global mergers and acquisitions practice. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP has added a state and local tax practice group to its nationwide tax practice. Partner Roburt Waldow joins from Jones Day in Orange County, California, while special counsel Greg Turner, who was most recently a vice president and senior tax counsel at the Council on State Taxation, will be based in Sacramento. Jeff Hoffman and Susan Wolfe have joined the white-collar defense and investigations group of Blank Rome LLP in New York. Hoffman joined as a partner, Wolfe as of counsel. They were previously partners at Hoffman & Pollok. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP hired William Rooklidge for its Orange County, California, office as a partner. Rooklidge, who was previously a partner with Jones Day, specializes in intellectual property law with a focus on patent litigation. Kate C. Lowenhar-Fisher has joined the Las Vegas office of Dickinson Wright PLLC as a member. She is a gaming attorney who advises on regulatory issues in connection with mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructuring, reorganizations and financings and was previously a shareholder at Brownstein Hyatt Faber Schreck. Chicago-based Freeborn & Peters LLP announced that Vito M. Pacione has joined the firm as a partner in its real estate practice group. He was previously a real estate lawyer at Jenner & Block LLP. Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP has hired Janis Meyer for its New York office as a partner in its \u201clawyers for the profession\u201d practice group. Meyer, who focuses on professional responsibility, ethics, risk management and other matters, was previously a partner and general counsel at Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP. She oversaw the bankruptcy and wind-down of the now-defunct firm. Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP has added Thomas B. Mason as a partner. Mason, who was previously a partner at Zuckerman Spaeder LLP, also counsels attorneys on professional responsibility, malpractice and ethics issues. In addition, he advises government officials and others on government ethics issues. Greenberg Traurig announced the opening of an office in Tokyo, the firm\u2019s third in the region, in addition to its offices in Shanghai and Seoul. The new office will be operated by Greenberg Traurig Horitsu Jimusho, an affiliate of Greenberg Traurig P.A. and Greenberg Traurig LLP. Koji Ishikawa, managing shareholder of the new office, joins from DLA Piper, and shareholders Yuji Ogiwara and Koichiro Ohashi, co-chairs of the firmwide Japan Practice, join from White & Case LLP. In the Midwest, Ogletree Deakins, which specializes in labor and employment law, said it was opening of an office in Milwaukee with nine lawyers -- five shareholders and four associates -- from Krukowski & Costello, S.C.

A trial was scheduled to start Wednesday on Connecticut hedge fund Pursuit Partners\u2019 claim that UBS sold it asset-backed securities without disclosing they were about to be downgraded. Attorneys for UBS and the Stamford-based hedge fund announced in open court Tuesday that they had reached an agreement to resolve the lawsuit, said Rhonda Hebert, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut state court system. Jury selection will be postponed while the parties work out the details, Hebert said. Pursuit Partners sued UBS in 2008, accusing it of selling it $40.5 million of collateralized debt obligations from July 2007 to October 2007, which some of the bank\u2019s employees referred to as \u201cvomit\u201d and \u201ccrap\u201d in e-mails.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, just before Thanksgiving, surprised the legal market by announcing its associate bonuses. While in some years the first firm becomes the standard-bearer, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP in 2014 upped the amounts for more senior associates by as much as $10,000 and caused a flurry of activity as other firms quickly began to follow the new market leader. In December, firms including Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton LLP, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP and Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP met the new going rate. Even Simpson Thacher ultimately raised its bonuses to match Davis Polk. As a result, at many firms bonuses ranged from $15,000 for the most junior associates to $100,000 for the most senior. There were, as is often the case, a few outliers. Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP awarded outsize bonuses as it has in past years, while Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP and Kirkland & Ellis LLP topped the market as well. Some firms stuck to their own traditions and will wait to announce until January or even February, as they do every year. DLA Piper LLP, Latham & Watkins LLP and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP, for example, typically wait until after Jan. 1. One interesting aspect of this year\u2019s announcements was the continued reliance on hours billed. While some firms, like Simpson Thacher, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP and Shearman & Sterling LLP didn\u2019t quantify a minimum number of hours billed, other firms set a floor and adjusted bonuses depending on hours billed. Those requirements typically allow pro bono work to be included in an associate\u2019s total. Associates at Kaye Scholer LLP who billed 2,000 hours or more, for example, received the going rate, but those exceeding 2,400 hours received an \u201cextraordinary\u201d bonus of $10,000 to $20,000 more depending on seniority (the hours in both tiers included pro bono and firm \u201ccitizenship\u201d work, according to a memo from the firm). Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, according to the blog  , had several rounds of announcements as it incrementally increased its levels depending on associate location. Ultimately, the firm matched the going rate for associates no matter where they\u2019re located. Emily Carhart, a spokeswoman for the firm, didn\u2019t return a call seeking comment. This year\u2019s bonuses exceeded last year\u2019s amounts, when they ranged from $10,000 for young associates to $60,000 for the most senior associates. In awarding the bigger bonuses, many of the firms acknowledged, even before the final numbers are in, that 2014 was a good year for many. Not surprisingly, it was transactional work that largely bolstered revenues. The robust deal market was, according to Dan DiPietro, the chairman of the Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group, \u201cthe single largest driver of this year\u2019s performance.\u201d Verso Paper Must Divest Two Mills to Proceed With NewPage Deal Verso Paper Corp., an unprofitable paper maker controlled by Apollo Global Management LLC, must sell two mills to proceed with a planned acquisition of NewPage Holdings Inc., the U.S. Justice Department said. The mills are in Rumford, Maine, and Biron, Wisconsin, and have a combined production capacity of about 940,0000 tons, the Justice Department said Dec. 31 in a statement. The divestitures resolve a civil lawsuit filed by the department\u2019s antitrust division Dec. 31. NewPage announced the sale of the mills to Catalyst Paper Corp. in October. Verso, which is based in Memphis, faces declining demand for its coated paper used in magazines amid the rising popularity of tablet computers and e-readers. It agreed Jan. 6 to acquire its less-indebted rival to avoid a debt restructuring that may have wiped out shareholders. The takeover is valued at about $1.4 billion including debt. Without the divestitures, the deal would have risked higher paper prices in the U.S. and Canada, the Justice Department said. For example, Verso and NewPage would have had about 70 percent of the market for coated label paper in the two countries. \u201cToday\u2019s proposed settlement will ensure that consumers benefit from continuing competition in the sale of coated paper,\u201d Assistant Attorney General William J.

In addition to the 1,024-room Parc 55, the company is buying two hotels in Orlando, Florida, and two in Key West that are already managed by Hilton, according to a statement Wednesday. The sellers include Hilton\u2019s majority owner, Blackstone Group LP. A team from Dentons represented Hilton Worldwide on the acquisition of the five assets, including partners Meghan Cocci, David Klein and Rick Ross, hotels and leisure practice; Bruce Davison, tax; Carol Anne Been, intellectual property; and Michael Maryn, pension, benefits and executive compensation. Real estate partner Matt Shebuski of Perkins Coie represented Hilton Worldwide with respect to the assumption of mortgage debt at the Orlando assets. Neither Peter Rose nor Christine Anderson, media representatives for Blackstone, responded to an e-mail asking which firm advised on the sale of the properties. Hilton is making the acquisitions with some of the proceeds from its $1.95 billion sale of the Waldorf Astoria to China\u2019s Anbang Insurance Group Co., which has been completed.

Fordham University Taps Cardozo Dean to Lead Its Law School Fordham University School of Law has chosen Matthew Diller, the current dean of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, as its next leader. For Diller, 55, the move to Fordham at the end of the academic year will be a homecoming of sorts. He taught at there for 16 years, and served as the Manhattan-based law school\u2019s associate dean for academic affairs from 2003 to 2008, leaving to become Cardozo\u2019s dean. \u201cI loved my time at Cardozo,\u201d the Harvard-educated lawyer said in a phone interview last week. \u201cI\u2019m most proud of the programs and initiatives in experiential education,\u201d he added, such as new clinics and the development of simulation courses, as well as a focus on skills such as e-discovery. In moving across town, Diller said, his goal is \u201cnot to import programs from Cardozo to Fordham. The larger issue is to look at the way the legal profession has changed and drill down on how we should adapt to meet the legal world.\u201d Diller said law schools need to teach students more than just how to draft a complaint, take a deposition and other litigation skills. With the tight job market and clients less willing to pay for young associates, law schools must respond, according to Diller. \u201cI hear again and again that lawyers want more prepared students,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is less patience in the marketplace for the young lawyer who is very talented but has limited concrete skills.\u201d Diller\u2019s appointment is the latest leadership change at New York\u2019s law schools. New York University School of Law chose Columbia Law School professor Trevor Morrison as its new dean in 2013. Columbia, for its part, named Gillian Lester, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, as its dean last year. Cardozo will now begin the process of finding Diller\u2019s replacement, the Manhattan-based school said on its website. While Cardozo is the law school of Yeshiva University, which operates under Jewish auspices, and Fordham Law is part of a Jesuit university, Diller isn\u2019t expecting a difficult transition. \u201cBoth schools focus on serving diverse populations and strive for excellence in legal education,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause both are related to faith-based institutions, it means that values are important at each school.\u201d Fordham and Cardozo \u201chave a lot of shared values,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a comfortable fit for me.\u201d Chambliss, Former U.S. Senator, Joins DLA Piper in Atlanta Saxby Chambliss, who recently completed his second term as a U.S. senator from Georgia, has joined DLA Piper LLP as a partner in Atlanta.

A day later, the central bank unexpectedly scrapped its currency cap, making the job of leasing the property more difficult. Investors such as Swiss Life, Switzerland\u2019s largest life insurer, and Pensimo Management AG, a Zurich-based pension fund manager which sealed Bern\u2019s   last year, keep buying properties even as rising vacancy rates cause rents to fall, eroding returns. That\u2019s because of a lack of high-yielding alternatives in a country with one of the world\u2019s lowest interest rates. \u201cThere\u2019s a decoupling of the commercial real estate market from the occupier market,\u201d said Fredy Hasenmaile, head of property research at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. \u201cPrices keep going up and we expect vacancies to rise further in the next two years.\u201d The central bank\u2019s   its three-year-old cap of 1.20 franc per euro, announced on Jan. 15, spurred a record surge in the franc against the single currency, pushing it to the highest in more than three years versus the dollar. That makes Swiss exports more expensive, damaging companies\u2019 revenue and the national economy, and increases the rental costs incurred by foreign companies operating in Switzerland. Martin Signer, head of real estate at Swiss Life, said the purchase of Rue du Rhone 8 in Geneva will add to the company\u2019s \u201csuperior\u201d property portfolio. The building will this year be renovated by UBS Group AG, the previous owner. While companies including Societe Generale SA have agreed to move into the building, 17 percent of the office space remains unleased. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual that a property has a higher vacancy during a comprehensive refurbishment,\u201d Signer said by e-mail. \u201cWe are very confident that this vacancy rate will quickly be reduced, in part because of the unique location and the modern and flexible refurbishment standard.\u201d Swiss office rentals have languished since 2011. A building boom in Zurich and Geneva, Switzerland\u2019s largest cities, created a surplus of space that forced landlords to cut rents. The vacancy rate climbed to 5.1 percent in Zurich -- Switzerland\u2019s biggest office market -- in the fourth quarter, the highest since 2004, according to data compiled by Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. Prime annual rents in the Swiss financial capital have fallen from a peak of 1,100 francs a square meter in 2011 to about 825 francs, Jones Lang said. In Geneva, the vacancy rate was 4.9 percent, the highest since at least 1998, Jones Lang said. Prime annual rents in Geneva fell 5.1 percent in 2014, to 925 francs per square meter. The SNB ended its policy of limiting the franc\u2019s value in euros, designed to shield the Swiss economy from the euro area\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis. On the day of the announcement, the   appreciated as much as 41 percent to 85.17 centimes per euro, the strongest level on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cThe news comes at an inopportune time because we already have a renter\u2019s market and now it will become even more so,\u201d said Claudio Saputelli, head of real estate research at UBS. The Swiss economy probably will grow only 0.5 percent in 2015, instead of 1.8 percent as previously forecast, UBS said after the SNB announced its decision. A stronger franc may also discourage foreign companies from renting offices in Switzerland, said Martin Bernhard, head of research at Jones Lang LaSalle in Zurich. In December, Google Switzerland said it\u2019s renting 50,000 square meters for its engineering center in Zurich. \u201cIf the franc increases further against the euro and the U.S. dollar, companies will think twice about expanding their presence here because it\u2019s already expensive,\u201d said Bernhard. Despite these obstacles, insurers and pension funds are eager to buy office properties as a way to earn stable returns, as bond investments offer record-low yields. Office buildings, while offering record-low prime yields of less than 4 percent, still beat negative returns available on the Swiss bond market. Investors bought about 3.1 billion francs of Swiss commercial properties in 2014, compared with 3.4 billion francs in 2013, according to Jones Lang. Buyer interest has increased since the SNB decision, said Luciano Gabriel, chief executive officer of PSP Swiss Property AG, the second-largest Swiss property company by market value. That\u2019s reflected in the stock market. PSP has gained 5.3 percent since the day before the SNB\u2019s announcement, while Swiss Prime Site AG has risen 2.7 percent. In contrast, Swiss Life has dropped about 15 percent, Credit Suisse has fallen about 16 percent and Cie. Financiere Richemont, owner of the Cartier brand, has lost 15 percent. Growing demand for buildings isn\u2019t unique to Switzerland: insurers, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds fuelled a   in worldwide property acquisitions in 2014, according to Jones Lang, as investors looked for a safe place to park their cash. The SNB\u2019s currency move was accompanied by a cut in interest rates, which makes it even more difficult for investors to earn returns in Swiss fixed-income markets, further boosting demand for properties. The widening divergence between rents and prices is \u201cnot a healthy development\u201d because it reflects artificially low interest rates resulting from faulty government debt policies in the euro zone, Gabriel said. \u201cThe gap can remain, but of course it can\u2019t widen indefinitely,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, investors are hoping that their properties won\u2019t suffer, as long as they buy centrally-located, modern buildings. \u201cProperties such as Rue du Rhone 8 will remain very attractive,\u201d said Swiss Life\u2019s Signer, referring to the office building the insurer bought in January on Geneva\u2019s upscale luxury-shopping street. \u201cIf commercial real estate comes under pressure, it will primarily be the peripheral locations and vulnerable sectors such as retail and gastronomy that are hit.\u201d","timestamp":1422230401.0,"participant_ids":["JLL:US","SLHN:VX"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-26\/swiss-offices-get-riskier-as-franc-surges-real-estate","subject":"Swiss Offices Get Riskier as Franc Surges: Real Estate"},{"body":" Law firms are betting that clients will keep getting into trouble. Yesterday, three firms -- Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP and Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP -- all announced that they were hiring former prosecutors to expand their white-collar practices. In addition, it appears that Squire Patton Boggs LLP is losing a pre-eminent group of defense lawyers, led by Robert Luskin, to Paul Hastings LLP. These lawyers were all sought after by firms seeking to either start or expand their practices in the high-profile and lucrative area of defense and investigations. The area has grown -- and grown increasingly complicated -- as enforcement matters frequently involve multiple jurisdictions worldwide. The result has been globalized enforcement without established globalized norms. As a result, government lawyers who already have navigated cross-border investigations are in high demand. \u201cAnd there\u2019s more coming,\u201d recruiter Alisa Levin of Greene Levin Snyder said yesterday. Firms are responding to their clients\u2019 current and projected needs. \u201cClients want to know the directions regulators are taking and want to know the issues before they become a problem,\u201d Jonathan Schiller, the managing partner of Boies Schiller, said in a phone interview.\u2019\u2019 His firm hired Matthew Schwartz, Peter Skinner and John Zach, three prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan, to start a new global investigations and white-collar defense practice area. The firm wants to focus on financial firms and the lawyers fit the bill: Among the cases they worked on at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office were the insider-trading prosecutions of SAC Capital Advisors LP, the bank-secrecy violation charges against JPMorgan Chase & Co. and several individuals associated with Bernard Madoff. In an interview with the three lawyers and Schiller, Schwartz said that they hoped to move together. \u201cWe\u2019ve all worked together in various capacities and have been friends for years. And we knew we worked well together as lawyers.\u201d They were looking for a package deal. The three, citing client confidentiality, wouldn\u2019t disclose what they are already working on, except to say that one case involved a dispute between two large financial institutions and another centers on a data breach. Boies Schiller also represents Sony in the fallout from a breach at that company\u2019s entertainment division last month. David O\u2019Neil, whose eight-year career at the U.S. Justice Department included prosecution of BNP Paribas over the bank\u2019s dealings with Sudan, Iran and Cuba, joined Debevoise & Plimpton as a partner in Washington. O\u2019Neil had served as the acting assistant attorney general for the criminal division. In July, his work on the BNP case led to a guilty plea for violations of U.S. sanctions. The Paris-based bank agreed to pay a record $8.97 billion to resolve state and federal probes. At Debevoise, O\u2019Neil will be working on white-collar matters as well as expanding the firm\u2019s work in privacy and cybersecurity, he said. Yesterday, reports began to circulate that Robert Luskin, a well-known defense attorney who represented Alstom SA in a Justice Department bribery investigation that ended with a record $772 million settlement, will leave Squire Patton Boggs with five other attorneys to join Paul Hastings. Luskin was a partner with legacy firm Patton Boggs, which merged with Squire Sanders last year. Luskin, who also represents New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s re-election campaign in the so-called Bridgegate investigation, is moving along with five other attorneys: Kwame Manley, John  Darden, Benjamin Wood, Jamie Gardner and Patrick Slevin, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the transition isn\u2019t finished.

Elizabeth Prewitt, a lead prosecutor in the U.S. criminal investigations into the rigging of currency and interest-rate benchmarks, has left the Justice Department to join Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP as a partner in New York. \u201cAfter 16 years, I feel like I\u2019ve had a fantastic range of opportunities with the Department of Justice, and I was ready to start a new chapter,\u201d Prewitt said in an interview. Prewitt helped lead the government\u2019s investigation into claims that banks manipulated the benchmark London interbank offered rate, which has resulted in settlements with lenders including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Barclays Plc. She also worked on the probe into manipulation of currency benchmarks, which is still under way. The moves are in addition to several that occurred in the fall. William Pericak, the former director of the Justice Department\u2019s Deepwater Horizon Task Force joined Jenner & Block LLP as a partner in Washington. Eugene Ingoglia, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, joined Morvillo LLP, the white-collar defense and litigation boutique. Denis McInerney, the former chief of the fraud section and deputy assistant attorney general in the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, returned to Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as a partner. Jeffrey Knox, the former chief of the fraud section of the Criminal Division, has joined Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP as a partner. And Antonia Apps, a lead prosecutor in the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, has joined Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP in New York. Enticing these lawyers to join is a competitive exercise. Law firm compensation, which of course outstrips a government salary, often seems secondary to other, more nuanced factors.

Latham & Watkins LLP represented Leonard Green, while Ropes & Gray LLP represented TPG. Kirkland & Ellis LLP represented LNK Partners, another investor in the deal. The Skadden team includes partners Joseph Coco and Peter Serating, both M&A; John Rayis, tax; and Erica Schohn, executive compensation and benefits. The Faegre team representing Life Time is led by corporate\/M&A partner Mike Stanchfield and also includes corporate\/M&A partners Jon Nygren and Morgan Burns, real estate partner Scott Anderegg and finance and restructuring partner Jim Pfau. Latham\u2019s M&A deal team is headed by partners Howard Sobel and John Giouroukakis. Also on the team are partners Joshua Tinkelman, finance; Joseph Kronsnoble, tax; Bradd Williamson, benefits; and James Hisiger, real estate. The team from Ropes & Gray representing TPG includes private equity partners William Shields and Alison Bomberg and finance partner Alexander Zeltser. From Kirkland representing LNK Partners are corporate partners Chris Torrente and William Sorabella. The investor group will pay $72.10 a share in cash for the Chanhassen, Minnesota-based company, according to a statement Monday. The price reflects a 73 percent premium to the closing price on Aug. 22, when Life Time said it was considering its strategic options, which also included conversion into a real estate investment trust. The deal includes a \u201creverse termination fee\u201d of $167 million to be paid by the investor group should they walk away, according to the merger agreement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If Life Time terminates the deal, the company must pay $97 million. In addition, the deal has a \u201cno shop\u201d provision which restricts Life Time\u2019s ability to entertain alternative proposals unless there is an unsolicited offer that is considered \u201csuperior.\u201d Many private equity deals have in recent years included \u201cgo-shop,\u201d rather than no-shop, provisions. Those clauses encourage the seller to continue to consider alternatives after the initial proposal is made public. While go-shop provisions remain common, Boston College Law School professor Brian JM Quinn said by telephone Tuesday, \u201cthey\u2019re not required. If the board has conducted a rigorous market check\u201d by exploring other options, he said, there is no duty to continue to look. Life Time spent almost seven months exploring its options, according to statements and filings the company made. The deal is one of the largest recent private equity deals. While not as outsized as those deals led by a group of buyout shops that occurred before the recession, the acquisition is essentially a club deal for a company of fitness clubs.

The supplier of drugs and services to nursing homes closed Thursday at a record $86.31 a share after people with knowledge of the matter   it\u2019s exploring a sale. Yet a bid for as much as $101 a share, or $9.8 billion -- which some analysts say is conceivable -- still wouldn\u2019t be expensive. Instead, it\u2019d be a way for industry buyers such as CVS Health Corp. or Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. to further boost next year\u2019s profits and payouts to their own shareholders. CVS and Walgreens, along with Express Scripts Holding Co., AmerisourceBergen Corp., McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc., could increase next year\u2019s earnings by acquiring Omnicare at that price, according to analyses by Credit Suisse Group AG and Cowen Group Inc. \u201cI would certainly think that people would at least take a look,\u201d Charles Rhyee, a New York-based analyst for Cowen, said in a phone interview. A sale to CVS would make the most sense, he said. A representative for Omnicare said the Covington, Kentucky-based company doesn\u2019t comment on speculation. Representatives for Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen declined to comment, and representatives for CVS, Express Scripts, McKesson and Cardinal Health didn\u2019t respond to phone calls or e-mails. Roughly three-quarters of Omnicare\u2019s revenue and operating profit comes from its long-term care group, which helps senior-living facilities manage their residents\u2019 medications. That business dispensed about 111 million prescriptions last year. Omnicare\u2019s smaller specialty-care division focuses on high-cost drugs with bigger reimbursement challenges for treatment areas such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and cancer. Omnicare is on the block less than a month after UnitedHealth Group Inc. agreed to buy Catamaran Corp. for about $13 billion including net debt. And in February, Rite Aid Corp. agreed to buy   from private-equity owner TPG for about $2 billion. Pharmacy-services providers are combining as they seek to gain a bigger piece of a market that\u2019s benefiting from increasing demand. Patients, insurers and companies are trying to manage costs amid rising drug prices. A takeover of Omnicare for $101 a share translates into 21 times trailing 12-month Ebitda, which would be in line with other industry transactions. The median multiple is about 20 for those struck during the past decade that exceeded $1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Express Scripts became the biggest pharmacy benefits management company after purchasing Medco Health Solutions Inc. three years ago for $34 billion including net debt. It\u2019s still the industry\u2019s largest deal. CVS has the second-biggest market share. Other possible suitors -- AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson -- are the dominant pharmaceutical distributors. Walgreens is the largest U.S. drugstore chain by revenue. An Omnicare purchase may make the most sense for CVS, Cowen\u2019s Rhyee said. Both are big in Medicare Part D, a federal program that subsidizes medicine for retirees, so there could be benefits from having the added scale. Also, as some drugstore customers age, CVS could continue serving them when they move into assisted-living centers and nursing homes, he said. For other suitors, buying all of Omnicare may be a tougher sell. For that reason, it may even be possible that Omnicare gets broken up, according to Vicki Bryan, an analyst for Gimme Credit. As Credit Suisse\u2019s Glen Santangelo put it, the specialty-pharmacy and manufacturer-services side \u201cis one of the coveted assets in the industry.\u201d The slower-growing long-term care business is \u201cgenerally less attractive,\u201d which may make it harder for some to justify a large takeover premium, the New York-based analyst wrote in a report Thursday. For Omnicare, selling itself makes sense because it wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve the same amount of scale as the big distributors and pharmacies on its own, said Jonathan Palmer, a New York-based analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cEverybody else around them is getting bigger,\u201d Palmer said in a phone interview. \u201cWhile Omnicare is the biggest company in the institutional pharmacy market, they\u2019re still a niche player in the overall health-care services market -- and that niche is pretty attractive to all those big companies.\u201d","timestamp":1429819201.0,"participant_ids":["OCR:US","ESRX:US","ABC:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-23\/omnicare-at-almost-10-billion-still-worth-it-for-cvs-real-m-a","subject":"Omnicare at Almost $10 Billion Still Worth It for CVS: Real M&A"},{"body":" The National Football League\u2019s $765 million settlement over concussions came up short a second time as a federal judge said she wants more changes before she\u2019ll approve it. U.S. District Judge Anita Brody in Philadelphia said the NFL should expand payment for some claims by about 5,000 players who sued the league seeking damages for head injuries. Brody was swayed by the objections of dozens of former players and their families who said the deal wasn\u2019t good enough, especially for those with symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a brain disease diagnosed only after death. The changes \u201cwould enhance the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy\u201d of the proposed settlement, Brody said in a three-page order. Brody asked lawyers for the league and players to address the issues before Feb. 13 or explain why they\u2019re unwilling to agree to the amendments. \u201cThe judge did not reject the settlement,\u201d Brian McCarthy, an NFL spokesman, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe judge asked both sides to address several issues before she grants final approval.\u201d Brody rejected an early version of the settlement in January 2014, citing concerns that a $675 million compensation fund may be insufficient to cover the class for the life of the accord\u2019s 65-year-term. In June, the NFL agreed to lift the cap on cash awards while tightening restrictions for audits of payments and damage award appeals.

Moncrief claimed Gazprom backed out of a deal for rights to develop a natural-gas field in Siberia, sabotaged the business agreement and stole its trade secrets. But a key piece of evidence the U.S. company relied on was revealed as a fake in the midst of a trial. \u201cIt was stunning,\u201d Van Beckwith, a lawyer for Gazprom, said of the discovery of the fake document. \u201cIt was my Perry Mason moment,\u201d said Beckwith, a partner at Baker Botts LLP, referring to the way the fictional lawyer would unexpectedly land on a single fact that would turn the case for his client. Beckwith said he and his team discovered during the trial that a key document was false, confirming their discovery with one Google search. Marshall Searcy, a lawyer for Moncrief and a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, formally asked a Texas judge to dismiss the lawsuit Monday. \u201cAn employee made a tragic mistake that created a flawed record,\u201d he told reporters outside the courtroom. He said he was unaware of the flaw until it was discovered by the defense. District Judge Melody Wilkinson approved the request and released jurors who had been hearing testimony since Jan. 8. The dismissal was the third time Moncrief failed in his pursuit of the lawsuit, with the company having lost in a German court in 2010 after a separate federal lawsuit was thrown out in the U.S. three years earlier.

Mylan\u2019s April 6 offer for Perrigo came less than a week after the company implemented its own provision to defend against an unwanted takeover. Since then, analysts have said that $33 billion Mylan would be a nice fit for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Teva needs to offset an   in earnings when cheaper copies of its top drug hit the market. Mylan could avoid getting bought by Teva or another drugmaker if it if can strike a deal with Perrigo -- yet so far its offer may be short of what\u2019s needed, which could draw in competitors for a deal. Mylan\u2019s bid values Perrigo at 26 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. While that\u2019s a rich multiple, it\u2019s lower than the 30-plus-times Ebitda other drug industry buyers have been willing to pay during a record period of takeovers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cThe most interesting thing about this deal is that shares of the buyer and seller -- and all the associated companies -- have gone up, which means the valuation isn\u2019t at a level where people are concerned yet,\u201d said Ronny Gal, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Since the offer was disclosed Wednesday, Mylan has risen 20 percent, almost as much as Perrigo. Teva also climbed. \u201cI think what happens next is the board of Teva will meet and decide whether they want to enter the fray,\u201d Gal said. Regardless of what Teva decides to do, there still could be other suitors for Perrigo. Gal says it\u2019s possible that Johnson & Johnson, which also sells to drug stores, or health-products distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp. could take a look. While Pfizer Inc. and Actavis Plc are busy trying to close other purchases, they can\u2019t be ruled out.

Closely held Smartflash LLC, which claimed that Apple infringed three patents, was seeking $852 million in damages, while Apple said the case was worth $4.5 million at most. A federal jury in Tyler, Texas, where Smartflash is based, on Tuesday rejected Apple\u2019s arguments that it didn\u2019t use the inventions and that the patents were invalid.  The dispute is over digital rights management and inventions related to data storage and managing access through payment systems. Smartflash claimed that iTunes used the inventions in applications such as Game Circus LLC\u2019s Coin Dozer and 4 Pics 1 Movie. Apple said it will appeal.  \u201cSmartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no U.S. presence and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented,\u201d said Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman. \u201cWe refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating, and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system.\u201d  Game Circus and another game developer, KingsIsle Entertainment Inc., maker of Wizard 101 and Grub Guardian, were defendants before being dismissed from the case last year.  In asking for $852 million, Smartflash argued it was entitled to a percentage of sales of Apple\u2019s devices, including the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers, that were used to access iTunes. It claimed that Apple intentionally infringed the patents, in part because one of its executives had been given a briefing on the technology more than a decade ago.  Cupertino, California-based Apple attacked every aspect of Smartflash\u2019s case. It said the patents were invalid and weren\u2019t infringed. It said Smartflash didn\u2019t have complete control of the patents and waited too long to sue.

RadioShack Corp.\u2019s biggest shareholder, already seeking to buy hundreds of stores from the bankrupt electronics retailer, agreed to a separate sale of the chain\u2019s name, with bids to start at $20 million.  The plan to break off the sale of trademarks and other intellectual property from the auction for store leases would put the 94-year-old brand up for grabs without forcing buyers also to bid on the stores.  Greg Gordon of Jones Day, a lawyer for RadioShack, announced the arrangement Wednesday in U.S. bankruptcy court as he outlined last-minute changes to a proposal by Standard General LP, which holds 10 percent of the company\u2019s stock, to buy as many as 2,000 stores.  Before the Fort Worth, Texas-based retailer filed for bankruptcy this month, Standard General agreed to bid on about half of the company\u2019s 4,000 locations, with plans to co-brand some of the stores with Sprint Corp., the wireless carrier.  An official committee of unsecured creditors has objected to various aspects of the proposal.  Susheel Kirpalani, a lawyer for the committee, on Wednesday told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon in Wilmington, Delaware, that Standard General is negotiating to buy senior debt owned by other hedge funds to improve its ability to trade debt for RadioShack assets, rather than pay cash, during an auction.  Kirpalani, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, said it was too soon to release those entities from any liability they may have incurred before the Feb. 5 bankruptcy filing.

The owners of Washington\u2019s National Football League team told a federal court in Virginia that the cancellation of its \u201cRedskins\u201d trademark is unconstitutional.  The team is attempting to hold on to the rights to its name despite opposition from American Indians that the term is racially disparaging.  In its Feb. 23 filing with the court, Pro-Football Inc. said the disputed trademarks were first used in 1933 and registered in 1967, and the move by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the marks \u201cimproperly singles out Pro-Football Inc. for disfavored treatment based solely on the content of its protected speech.\u201d  The patent office issued a cancellation order June 18.  The team ownership also argued in its filing that the patent office is \u201cinterfering with the ongoing public discourse\u201d over the name, and  \u201cchoosing sides and cutting off the debate.\u201d Cancellation amounts to the taking of the team ownership\u2019s property \u201cfor an unconstitutional public use without just compensation,\u201d Pro-Football argued.  The team ownership filed the suit in August 2014, following the adverse ruling from the patent office. A group of American Indians filed an opposition to the trademark in 2006. In addition to the patent office, individual members of that group are also named as defendants in the case in federal court.  The case is Pro-Football Inc. v.

Eighteen years later, Moncrief, the grandson of one of the original Texas wildcatters, is still trying to enforce his company\u2019s claim against the Russian energy giant, this time before a hometown jury in state court in Fort Worth. The trial, set to begin with opening statements today, may be the best chance for his Moncrief Oil International Inc. to claim compensation from Gazprom, after losing previously in multiple other courts. Moncrief Oil, which is seeking $1.37 billion in damages from Gazprom and several subsidiaries, lost in a German courtroom in 2010 and a separate suit over the same deal was dismissed in federal court in Texas in 2007. The trial\u2019s location, in the city where Moncrief Oil is based, is a concern for Gazprom, Mike Calhoon, a lawyer for the Russian company, told prospective jurors Tuesday. He asked 150 prospective jurors whether they would be predisposed to favor someone from the locally prominent Moncrief family over a Russian business. Dozens raised their numbered cards to indicate they would be. A jury of six men and six women selected yesterday will hear the case. Closely held Moncrief Oil accuses Gazprom of backing out of a deal over rights to develop the field, blocking a joint venture with Occidental Petroleum Corp. and misappropriating trade secrets related to a plan to sell Russian gas to U.S. consumers. Moncrief says it obtained its interest in Russia\u2019s Yuzhno-Russkoye Field, also known as the Y-R Field, through a series of agreements with a Gazprom subsidiary. Gazprom later contracted with the German chemical company BASF SE to develop the field. Gazprom, which has denied wrongdoing, says Moncrief should be pursuing its claims in Russia and not in the U.S. Moncrief is suing in the U.S. because Russia is \u201cnot a realistic option given the culture of lawlessness that pervades Russian society,\u201d lawyers for the Texas company said in court papers. Lawyers for both sides declined to comment before trial. Moncrief contends the initial deal was muddied by corruption in Russia before Vladimir Putin became prime minister and then president. Gazprom dropped the deal later, after it was seemingly back on track. After Putin rose to power, Moncrief met with the highest officials of Gazprom \u201cwho promised they had mended their ways\u201d and would honor Moncrief\u2019s interest in the field,  , a lawyer for the family, told prospective jurors. \u201cYou will hear this was just another string of false promises,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeking big damages. Big, big damages.\u201d Moncrief said it relied on the purported deal with Gazprom to develop a separate joint venture with Occidental Petroleum that would import natural gas and market it from Texas throughout the U.S. Occidental agreed to the joint venture in exchange for an option to acquire an interest in the Y-R field from Moncrief, according to court papers. Gazprom \u201cdestroyed the joint venture,\u201d Moncrief\u2019s lawyers said in the company\u2019s complaint. Gazprom met with Occidental, suggesting an arrangement that could \u201cbypass any participation by Moncrief,\u201d and asked Occidental to persuade Moncrief to end its litigation over rights to the field, the lawyers said. Gazprom representatives \u201cpointedly closed the meeting by reminding Occidental of its significant Russian assets,\u201d Moncrief lawyers said in the complaint. \u201cOccidental terminated its joint venture with Moncrief in the middle of 2007 as a result of the defendants\u2019 untoward conduct.\u201d Both the German and U.S. federal courts rejected the initial Moncrief suits, finding a lack of jurisdiction. Moncrief\u2019s case in federal court in Fort Worth was dismissed in 2007 and the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans affirmed the dismissal. In its opinion, the panel said the federal court couldn\u2019t weigh in on a purely foreign transaction. \u201cJurisdiction would exist if Gazprom committed a tort while in the state,\u201d the court said. That left an opening for Moncrief to pursue its claims against Gazprom in state court. In the current action, Moncrief claims Gazprom misappropriated trade secrets and interfered with its business as a result of a series of meetings and discussions that followed Gazprom\u2019s announced intention in 2003 to sell liquefied natural gas to the U.S., according to a summary of the case in a 2013 Texas Supreme Court opinion. Gazprom representatives traveled to Fort Worth, Houston and Boston to participate in talks, which included Moncrief\u2019s study of the U.S. natural gas market and prospects for building a liquefied natural gas import terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas. That project would have been a partnership with Houston-based Occidental. Gazprom relied on confidential information gathered in talks with Moncrief and pursued separate talks with Occidental, according to Moncrief\u2019s suit. Gazprom later established a Houston unit to import liquefied natural gas, regasify it and sell it in the U.S., according to the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s opinion. Richard Moncrief is the son of William \u201cTex\u201d Moncrief and grandson of the late William \u201cMonty\u201d Moncrief, who was among the original wildcatters making discoveries in east Texas in the 1930s, said Bruce Bullock, director of the McGuire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u201cIn Dallas you have the Hunts and in Fort Worth, it\u2019s the Moncriefs and the Basses,\u201d Bullock said. Richard Moncrief, after working with the family business, founded Moncrief Oil International to explore for oil and gas overseas, according to the website of the family\u2019s Moncrief Oil and Montex Drilling Co. \u201cThe venture proved to be very lucrative for Dick Moncrief,\u201d according to the website. \u201cThe Moncriefs have been synonymous with Texas oil and big finds for a long time,\u201d Bullock says. Tex Moncrief was 89 in 2010 when he made one of the biggest discoveries of his career, the Davy Jones gas well in the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana.

Reliance Industries Ltd., owner of the world\u2019s largest oil-refining complex, retreated for the first time in five days. Tata Motors Ltd., the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, rallied to a four-month high, while Coal India Ltd. increased for a third day. About three stocks dropped for every two that rose on the S&P BSE Sensex, which slid 0.1 percent to 26,552.92 at the close after climbing as much as 0.8 percent earlier. The gauge has declined in seven of the eight trading sessions as earnings of some of India\u2019s biggest companies trailed estimates. Sales at Sensex firms that have posted September-quarter results so far have declined 12 percent from a year earlier even as profits have risen 2.4 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \u201cThe earnings season has not helped and some of the key results are still to come,\" Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP, said by phone from the southern state of Kerala. \u201cBesides, no one wants to keep their position open ahead of Bihar election verdict. There are uncertainties and no positive triggers.\u201d The Bihar elections are important for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s efforts to control the upper house of parliament, where opposition parties have blocked major economic proposals including a nationwide sales tax. A win would give him momentum in about a dozen more state elections through 2017 that will determine control of the body. The results are due on Sunday. GAIL India fell 2.1 percent.

Cameron stockholders will receive 0.716 Schlumberger shares and a cash payment of $14.44 in exchange for each Cameron share, according to a regulatory statement on Wednesday. The deal valued Cameron at $66.36 a share, a 56 percent premium based on both companies\u2019 closing share prices on Tuesday before the deal was announced. The agreement would help Schlumberger become a one-stop shop for crude explorers, adding Cameron\u2019s valves, pumps and blowout preventers to its in-house engineering expertise. The slump in oil prices over the past year has forced oil companies to cut back on costly exploration and investment, fueling competition among service providers for a chunk of that shrinking spending. \u201cThis is a sign that Schlumberger sees a market bottom,\u201d Matt Marietta, a Houston-based analyst at Stephens Inc. who rates the stock a buy and owns none, said today in a telephone interview. \u201cSchlumberger didn\u2019t have to agree to it this week. They could have waited for things to worsen. It can probably bring some confidence back to energy investors that we are approaching a bottom.\u201d Schlumberger fell 3.4 percent to $70.09 in New York, while Cameron surged 41 percent to $59.93. The acquisition marks a shift in the oilfield service and equipment industries, which have generally stayed at arm\u2019s length from one another. Cameron is the world\u2019s largest provider of the so-called surface wellheads, a vital set of valves that sit atop the well to control the flow of oil from the underground reservoirs. Schlumberger is looking to create even more efficiency with drilling and production by creating a single operating system that marries its well engineering and digital mapping of oil pockets with Cameron\u2019s critical gear. \u201cCameron is a great hardware company, and we have all these digital capabilities and the leading downhole portfolio,\u201d Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard told analysts and investors today on a conference call. \u201cThe combination of all these factors is why we\u2019re very excited about the transaction.\u201d The deal follows the proposed merger between the world\u2019s second- and third-largest oilfield services providers Halliburton Co. and Baker Hughes Inc. in a deal valued at about $35 billion when it was announced in November. The Cameron purchase is diversification into oilfield equipment supply rather than consolidation of a rival service company, so it is unlikely to face an antitrust challenge, Marietta said. The companies had been partners in a joint venture they created in 2012 called OneSubsea in a long-term bid to lower the overall cost and improve performance in deepwater development. By actually owning its joint venture partner, Schlumberger will be able to work that plan more effectively, Kibsgaard said. Given Schlumberger\u2019s past history of buying partners, including its 2010 deal for rival Smith International Inc., this deal was expected to\u00a0eventually happen, Kurt Hallead, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote today in a note to investors. \u201cBut this is sooner than we had thought,\u201d he wrote. The companies must see potential for gaining from the deal since they\u2019ve worked so closely together, Alain Parent, an analyst at Natixis SA said by telephone. \u201cThey want to go one step further after the joint venture.\u201d Service companies typically outsource a lot of their fabrication, while Cameron takes a lot of pride in its manufacturing, Dennis Cassidy, managing director at financial consultant AlixPartners LLP, said in a phone interview. \"How those philosophies mesh and how they measure productivity will be an interesting transition,\u201d Cassidy said. The deal, which the companies hope to close by the first quarter next year, is expected to be accretive to Schlumberger earnings per share in the first year after closing, while they see a combined $900 million in synergy gains in the first two years, Schlumberger Chief Financial Officer Simon Ayat told investors and analysts today on a conference call. Goldman Sachs is acting as financial adviser\u00a0to Schlumberger, with Baker Botts LLP and Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP as legal counsel. For\u00a0Cameron, Credit Suisse is acting as financial adviser and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP as legal counsel. The $14.8 billion deal value is based on Schlumberger\u2019s closing share price on Tuesday and includes $1.1 billion in debt and $900 million in non-controlling interest, Ayat said on the call.","timestamp":1440573204.0,"participant_ids":["SLB:US","SLB:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-26\/schlumberger-agrees-to-buy-cameron-for-66-36-a-share","subject":"Schlumberger to Buy Cameron in $14.8 Billion Oil Services Deal"},{"body":"The Chinese are coming and they are setting their sights on cricket in South Asia. After Pepsico Inc. broke off its 3.97 billion-rupee ($61 million)   deal with the glitzy Indian Premier League 10 days ago, a Chinese smartphone maker is stepping in to gain from cricket\u2019s almost religion-like status in a region of 1.2 billion people. Vivo Mobile India Pvt., a unit of Guangdong BBK Electronics Industry Co.,   Pepsico\u00a0as the title sponsor, undeterred by the fading popularity of the tournament, which has lately been plagued by scandals. While Vivo has surprised most Indians who have never heard of the brand, the cricket contract may just be what the Chinese company needs, scandals notwithstanding, to expand its reach in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing smartphone markets. India is set to overtake the U.S. to become the second biggest mobile-phone buyer in the world by 2017, according to International Data Corp. \u201cWe think IPL is the most influential brand in India,\u201d Alex Feng, chief executive officer of Vivo Mobile India said in an interview. \u201cIt can help raise people\u2019s awareness about Vivo in India. We think it\u2019s the best platform.\u201d Feng declined to comment on the price paid for the sponsorship, except to say that the deal was \u201cworth the price.\u201d The brand, which made its mark in China with smartly designed phones that sell for less than $100, will mainly compete with local handset makers Micromax Informatics Ltd. and Intex Technologies India Pvt., and other Chinese manufacturers,\u00a0Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research in Mumbai, said. \u201cIndia is a huge opportunity for everyone and whoever keeps investing now will recoup the rewards later,\u201d Shah said in an interview. \u201cJust look at Samsung and Micromax - they invested hugely in setting up a network and are No. 1 and 2 for quite some time now.\u201d Vivo has a   of rapidly grabbing market share from established rivals.\u00a0In its highly competitive home market, the company rose to the fourth place\u00a0ahead of Samsung Electronics Corp. with a 8.1 percent share of the Chinese market, from an 11th place less than two years ago, according to Counterpoint. The company\u2019s phones are available at 10,000 outlets in India, Feng said. Vivo will stay focused on selling through brick-and-mortar stores rather than online sales, he said. India\u2019s smartphone market can be divided into three categories, with different companies dominating each band. Local handset makers Micromax, Intex and Karbonn Mobiles India Ltd. dominate the sub $100 category, whereas Chinese manufacturers Xiaomi Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd. are known for their models that range between $100 and $150, Shah said. Samsung is the biggest seller of the higher end phones up to $400. Vivo has seven models selling in India that range from $92 to $510, though if its China business were an indication, then most of the sales focus will be on the cheapest models. \u201cThey develop the high-end models and advertise it extensively, but their volumes come from the cheaper models,\u201d Kiranjeet Kaur, a senior analyst at International Data Corp., said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably take the same approach in India.\u201d But the path in India will take a long time. The company\u2019s market share was 0.5 percent in the quarter ended June, according to Counterpoint data. That compares with market leaders Samsung and Micromax, which control about 25 percent and 18 percent each. The IPL, where eight teams compete in the Twenty20 short-format version of cricket, started in 2008 when the Board of Control for Cricket in India auctioned off the league\u2019s clubs to investors including billionaire Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd., and movie star Shah Rukh Khan. The rapid-fire appeal of a Twenty20 match has led to high-scoring games, with more risk-taking by the batsmen, attracting viewers who otherwise\u00a0don\u2019t have the time to watch the game\u2019s classic format five-day test matches or a one-day face-off that is typically played for about six hours, not including lunch and refreshments. However, the league\u2019s reputation has been tainted by allegations of illegal betting and match-fixing. In 2013, several IPL players and team officials were arrested on charges of placing bets on matches, a practice that\u2019s illegal in India. Earlier this year, the Board of Control for Cricket in India   two teams -- the Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals -- for two years citing misconduct by its officials. Chennai\u2019s team was among the league\u2019s most decorated, and headed by Indian national team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Spokesmen for Rajasthan Royals didn\u2019t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment, while Kasi Vishwanathan, director, at Chennai Super Kings, declined to comment. Pepsico said Oct. 9 that it had notified the cricket board about its \u201cconcerns\u201d over the tournament and that discussions were ongoing between the two parties. About 10 days later, the board announced that Vivo had been   as the title sponsor for two years. Pepsico India spokesman Pradeep Wadhwa did not respond to a phone call and text message seeking comment. BCCI spokesmen Nishant Jeet Arora and Gaurav Saxena didn\u2019t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment. Partly because of these scandals, and also because of a plethora of cricket on television, the allure of the sport for audiences has fallen. This has made the return from IPL sponsorships \u201csomewhat unpredictable,\u201d prompting consumer goods companies to reduce their engagement with the sport, said Ajimon Francis, head of India operations at consultancy Brand Finance Plc. However, by putting its name on a popular cricket series that is viewed on television by millions of Indians, Vivo will be able to quickly engender widespread brand awareness, Counterpoint\u2019s Shah said. The scandals may not have a sizable impact on the company\u2019s prospects. \u201cEven the Olympic Games\u00a0or the World Cup may have such controversies,\u201d Vivo\u2019s Feng said. \u201cThat cannot change the impact that cricket can make in India. It\u2019s an activity for everyone from different regions, religions, ages, languages.\u201d","timestamp":1445847227.0,"participant_ids":["005930:KS","MICRO:IN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-26\/a-tainted-indian-league-gets-chinese-backer-no-local-s-heard-of","subject":"A Tainted Indian League Gets Chinese Backer No Local's Heard Of"},{"body":" Hunton & Williams LLP has hired Timothy Heaphy, the former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, as a partner in its Washington and Richmond, Virginia, offices.

Zuckerberg Bedroom Privacy Hinges on Claim of Broken Promise A number of e-mails are at the center of property war between Mark Zuckerberg, the billionaire founder of Facebook Inc., and a real estate developer who had contracted to buy the property behind Zuckerberg\u2019s home in Palo Alto, California. The developer, Mircea Voskerician had sent a letter to the Facebook chief executive officer saying he planned to tear down the home and build a 9,600-square-foot replacement which would overlook the Zuckerberg\u2019s master bedroom. As Bloomberg\u2019s Joel Rosenblatt reports, Voskerician proposed to sell Zuckerberg a slice of the property to afford him more privacy. Within two weeks, they agreed that Zuckerberg would buy Voskerician\u2019s contractual rights to purchase the entire property. Voskerician claims he had a competing offer and that he sold Zuckerberg those rights at a steep discount. He alleges that Zuckerberg promised to introduce him to contacts in Silicon Valley, although no promise was put into writing. Zuckerberg\u2019s lawyers deny Voskerician\u2019s claims. Whatever the case, the developer sued and, unless the two sides reach a deal, the case will go to trial. The case is Voskerician v.

Net income may be 5 billion yen ($41 million) in the fiscal year through March, Takata said Friday, down from the company\u2019s 20 billion yen forecast made in May. The Tokyo-based company recorded a special loss of about   in the July-September period, following a consent order it reached with National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Takata\u2019s cut in forecast comes as an increasing number of its customers say they no longer will use its air-bag inflators linked to scores of injuries and seven deaths in the U.S. Subaru-maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. are among automakers considering such a step after Toyota, Honda and Mazda Motor Corp.\u2019s decision to stop using Takata\u2019s ammonium nitrate inflators.  Takata fell 6.2 percent in Tokyo trading before the announcement, resulting in a 39 percent three-day decline, the most on record. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week fined Takata as much as a record $200 million, including a $70 million civil penalty to be paid in six installments by October 2020. The agency ordered the company to phase out ammonium nitrate-based inflators\u00a0by 2018. It also said Takata provided \u201cselective, incomplete or inaccurate information\u201d to the agency and customers since at least 2009. Hours after the agency\u2019s order, Honda, its largest customer, made the announcement that it won\u2019t use Takata inflators in future models. The loss was significant as it led analysts to openly question Takata\u2019s ability to survive and even President Shigehisa Takada acknowledged a risk to the company\u2019s existence.

Inflators are only a portion of its air bag products, and other components the company has to fall back on include seat belts, steering wheels, electronics and child seats. The moves by Honda and Mazda add to a shift away from Takata that was already taking place involving the use of the replacement inflators for recalled vehicles.

While oil and gas explorers have seized on renewed investor appetite to issue almost $10 billion of U.S. junk bonds in 2015, none have been sold by services companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $40 billion of junk-rated bonds issued by drillers including Hercules Offshore Inc. and equipment suppliers such as Seventy Seven Energy Inc. have lost 2.58 percent this year. That compares with a 1.75 percent gain for speculative-grade securities across the energy industry. The problem is that even as explorers crank up oil production during the slump in crude prices, they\u2019re using 45 percent   than they were just six months ago. That prompted oil-service firms to cut their prices in order to win a shrinking amount of business. \u201cYou have a double impact on their revenue,\u201d Brian Gibbons, a senior analyst for oil and gas at CreditSights Inc., said in a telephone interview. He estimates drillers and other suppliers have cut prices by 10 percent to 40 percent. \u201cWe typically see more casualties in the services space,\u201d he said. Such concerns were barely registering when oil was still trading for more than $100 a barrel in June and the 2014 default rate for speculative-grade energy companies was just 1.4 percent, as measured by Standard & Poor\u2019s. With central banks globally suppressing interest rates, investors have binged on high-yielding debt, allowing companies in the industry to raise more than $120 billion of speculative-grade bonds in the U.S. the past three years. Now buyers of the debt are gearing up for a surge in defaults after crude prices collapsed more than 50 percent. The trailing 12-month default rate will jump to as high as 15 percent at the end of June 2016, according to Matthew Mish, a credit strategist at UBS Group AG in New York. Oilfield service providers will likely default at an even higher rate than the broader industry, he said. Houston-based Cal Dive International Inc., which provides   vessels to oil and gas rigs, filed for   protection this month after project delays hampered its ability to manage its debt. Other servicing firms have terminated workers and cut spending. Houston-based Vantage Drilling Co., which has more than doubled its debt during the past three years to $2.7 billion, said last month that it would defer a payment for construction of an ultra-deepwater drillship named  . Vantage plans to use debt financing for the third and final payment of $476 million upon delivery, expected in early 2016, according an annual earnings report filed this month. \u201cIt\u2019s an expensive ship,\u201d Spencer Cutter, an energy credit analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s state-of-the-art, but it\u2019s not contracted.\u201d Vantage Chief Financial Officer Douglas Smith didn\u2019t return telephone calls seeking comment. The company\u2019s bonds have lost 19 percent this year, more than any other energy company in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index of speculative-grade bonds. The market value of its $1.1 billion of 7.5 percent notes due November 2019 has plunged to $646 million, from $1.23 billion in January 2014, according to data from Trace, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\u2019s bond-price reporting system. The market value of the $300 million of speculative-grade notes Hercules Offshore issued just a year ago has fallen to about $83 million, prices compiled by Bloomberg show. The driller, also based in Houston, said last month that Saudi Arabian Oil Co. terminated its lease for a rig that was scheduled to work through September 2019. The rig, which could work in water as deep as 250 feet, was earning the second-highest rate in Hercules\u2019s fleet. Hercules, which analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect to earn $31.2 million this year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, has $1.2 billion of debt outstanding. The combination of declining earnings power and rig cancellations \u201craises concern that the company\u2019s financial position will become precarious as 2015 unfolds,\u201d Stuart Miller, a senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, said in a March 5 report. Tyler Arver, a spokesman for Hercules in Houston, declined to comment. The number of active oil and gas rigs has plunged to the lowest level since October 2009, when the U.S. was starting to recover from its worst recession since the Great Depression, according to data from Baker Hughes Inc. The 1,069 active rigs in the U.S. last week is down from last year\u2019s high of 1,931 in September. It\u2019s hard to see offshore drillers meeting sales expectations for next year based on their current backlog of contracts, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Andrew Cosgrove and William Foiles said in a March 23 report. Hercules and Vantage have the largest gaps among 12 companies analyzed and \u201cdesperately need new work,\u201d they wrote. Seventy Seven Energy, a provider of wellsite services and equipment that was spun off from Chesapeake Energy Corp. last year, is shifting part of its 2015 capital expenditure budget into next year as it focuses on preserving cash. Prices of its bank debt and bonds have tumbled. The Oklahoma City-based firm\u2019s $648 million of unsecured notes due in 2019 is trading at 74.75 cents, down from as high as 108.25 in June, Trace prices show.

The Samsung Z1 -- with 3G capability and a liquid-crystal display -- is selling for 5,700 rupees, the world\u2019s largest smartphone maker said in a statement. It\u2019s the first phone using Tizen, the system Samsung developed with Huawei Technologies Co. and Intel Corp. to challenge the Android software that powers most of the world\u2019s mobile devices. A Tizen phone, which has been delayed for more than a year, was the missing link in Samsung\u2019s plan to build a revenue-generating platform similar to those run by Google and Apple Inc. Samsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae Yong is trying to revive profit growth and defend against new, larger-screen iPhones and models from Xiaomi Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough sell,\u201d said Neil Shah, Mumbai-based analyst with Counterpoint Technology Market Research. \u201cThe price point they\u2019re targeting is still pretty high, and the Tizen overall OS experience is still way behind Android. It\u2019s already eight years late to the party.\u201d Samsung, also the world\u2019s largest maker of TVs,   its first Tizen-powered sets at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, saying all Web-ready models it sells this year will use the operating system. In April, it released the Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo  , which are compatible with many Samsung Galaxy phones. Shares of Samsung rose 0.4 percent to close at 1,345,000 won in Seoul before the phone was announced. The stock fell 3.3 percent last year after a 9.9 percent decline in 2013. The release of the Z1 marks the first time Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung has sold a phone using another OS since experimenting with devices using Microsoft Inc.\u2019s Windows Mobile, including the   in 2012. Nearly all 243 million phones Samsung shipped as of Sept. 30 used Google software. Samsung\u2019s Z1 comes in black, red or white, with dual SIM-card slots and a 3.1-megapixel rear camera, the company said. \u201cThe ultra-cheap Tizen phone could be well received by people in emerging markets like India, especially gateway users,\u201d Lee Min Hee, a Seoul-based analyst at I\u2019M Securities Co., said by phone today. While Samsung last year planned to introduce a different Tizen model called the Z in Russia, that phone hasn\u2019t materialized. Four other smartphones the company announced Jan. 6 for the Indian market, including the Galaxy E5 and E7, run on Android. Prices start at 19,300 rupees. Manufacturers are focusing on price as they rush into India, the world\u2019s fastest-growing smartphone market, according to International Data Corp. More than 700 million Indians live on less than $2 a day and more than four-fifths of phones sell for less than $200. India\u2019s Micromax Informatics Ltd. secured a fifth of the market by providing inexpensive, feature-rich phones, according to IDC. Google teamed with Micromax and other local makers last year to introduce the Android One, which costs as little as 5,450 rupees on Flipkart.com. \u201cIndia\u2019s mobile market is in the early stages of smartphone adoption and is open to new smartphone platforms that are open source,\u201d said Asim Warsi, vice president of Samsung\u2019s India unit. Samsung is facing some of the strongest challenges to its supremacy in China and India, the world\u2019s two biggest smartphone markets. Last year, Samsung surrendered its top spot in China to Xiaomi. Samsung\u2019s online Tizen store will have about 1,000 apps available for users, compared with more than 1 million apps each for Android and Apple iOS devices. The company announced earlier this month that its operating profit in the   may come in at 5.2 trillion won ($4.8 billion), slumping 37 percent from a year earlier. Operating income at the phone division probably fell to 1.6 trillion won on sales of 27 trillion won in the December quarter, according to the recent median estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. That would be the unit\u2019s smallest quarterly profit in almost four years.","timestamp":1421211694.0,"participant_ids":["005930:KS","GOOGL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-14\/samsung-tries-to-shake-google-reliance-with-92-phone-in-india","subject":"Samsung Tries to Shake Google Reliance With $92 India Phone"},{"body":" Trusts and estates lawyers, once second-class citizens at some large corporate firms, have become revenue producers. And at firms including Loeb & Loeb LLP, McDermott Will & Emery LLP and Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, the departments, which often include lawyers who specialize in tax as well as trusts and estates, are anything but back-office. \u201cWe are generators of work as well as service providers,\u201d Carol Harrington, the head of the private client practice group at McDermott Will, said in an interview last week. That work includes estate planning, creating \u201cstructures\u201d for charitable giving, and litigation and international work, said Joshua Rubenstein, the head of the T&E practice at Katten Muchin. In addition, Harrington said, many private businesses are controlled in trust, so these lawyers are often called upon in transactions. To fully advise on deals involving some closely held companies, \u201cYou need trust counsel to help with the trust aspects of the business.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re like Marcus Welby,\u201d Rubenstein said, referring to the iconic family doctor of 1970s television. \u201cWe\u2019re generalists: We have to know about areas other than T&E, like tax and real estate. And we have to be able to diagnose people\u2019s problems.\u201d As wealth escalates among clients, the firms with these practices are also seeing that generalists can be a growth area. The scope of work, whether in forming of trusts, establishing philanthropy or helping in business succession planning in the U.S. or abroad, is expanding. \u201cTo be really good in estate planning you need to be full service to every need a high-net-worth individual might have,\u201d Leah Bishop of Loeb & Loeb explained in an interview last week. She co-heads the firm\u2019s trusts and estates department and charitable giving and tax-exempt organizations practice. If the T&E lawyers don\u2019t have the expertise, they need to know who to tap within the firm. With a somewhat limited pool of experienced talent, new lateral hires, with their Rolodexes, are a big deal for these firms. Last week, for example, Loeb & Loeb announced it had hired two attorneys from Caplin & Drysdale Chartered -- Marcus Owens, a former director of the Exempt Organizations Division of the Internal Revenue Service, and Diara Holmes. Both have joined the firm\u2019s charitable giving and tax-exempt organizations practice, which is part of the trusts and estates practice, as partners in Washington. Loeb & Loeb\u2019s group has approximately 50 lawyers -- out of close to 300 total attorneys. McDermott Will, for its part, last week said it hired Leigh-Alexandra Basha from Holland & Knight LLP to establish a private client practice in Washington. Basha focuses on domestic and foreign estate and tax planning. Henry Christensen, head of McDermott\u2019s international private client group, said that with the firm\u2019s international and tax practice, Basha\u2019s addition \u201cis a natural fit.\u201d Lawyers at these firms say the revenue generated by their practices exceeds their headcount. At Katten Muchin, for example, the approximately 50 people in his group account for more than 7 percent of the firm\u2019s 700 lawyers.  The group brings in 12 percent to 15 percent of the firm\u2019s revenue, which doesn\u2019t include cross-referrals within the firm, Rubenstein said. At McDermott, the trusts and estates lawyers \u201cgenerate more than 10 percent of the firm\u2019s revenue, but by headcount we are less than 10 percent,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cIt\u2019s because we export work to other areas in addition to working hard ourselves.\u201d Those numbers might tempt other firms, many of which jettisoned their practices years ago, to jump back into the area. \u201cFor the economics to work, you need high-net worth individuals as clients and you need to be a gatekeeper for the rest of their work\u201d to help with whatever needs arise, said Loeb & Loeb\u2019s Bishop. And firms need to understand that these clients don\u2019t want the same \u201cbreadth of staffing\u201d that corporate clients will withstand on major litigation or transactions, she said. In addition, it takes a certain type of lawyer to handle this work. \u201cWe take our clients from birth to death,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cOne client told me I was more useful than her therapist. And I do give out my home phone number.\u201d AIG\u2019s $970.5 Million Investor Settlement Approved American International Group Inc. got federal court approval of a $970.5 million settlement with investors who claimed they were misled about the insurer\u2019s subprime mortgage exposure. AIG will pay $960 million and the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will pay $10.5 million to investors led by a Michigan pension fund, according to papers filed in Manhattan federal court.

In the unanimous ruling, which focused on opinions expressed in documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the high court said investors can sue if those documents omit important facts. Still, as Bloomberg\u2019s Greg Stohr reports, the justices rejected a federal appeals court\u2019s conclusion that investors can sue if an opinion contained in SEC filings is later found to be wrong. That provision \u201cdoes not allow investors to second-guess inherently subjective and uncertain assessments,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court. The case stemmed from statements included in a 2005 registration statement for a stock offering by Omnicare Inc. Investors had accused the company of misleading purchasers by saying it complied with laws and regulations in its filings. A federal appeals court ruling would have required Omnicare to defend the lawsuit, but the court\u2019s decision sends the case back to the lower courts to assess whether Omnicare omitted any material facts in its filing. \u201cA reasonable investor may, depending on the circumstances, understand an opinion statement to convey facts about how the speaker has formed the opinion -- or, otherwise put, about the speaker\u2019s basis for holding that view,\u201d Kagan wrote for the court. \u201cAnd if the real facts are otherwise, but not provided, the opinion statement will mislead its audience.\u201d Omnicare has since reached a series of settlements with state and federal officials to resolve allegations involving illegal kickbacks. In 2009, the company agreed to pay $98 million to settle government accusations it paid kickbacks to obtain business and received them for recommending drugs. The agreement didn\u2019t include any finding of wrongdoing by the Covington, Kentucky-based company. The case is Omnicare v. Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund, 13-435.

The two companies are discussing a deal that would create one major office-supply chain in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are still private. The negotiations were   by the Wall Street Journal, which called the talks \u201cadvanced.\u201d Staples rose as much as 13 percent to $19.40 in New York, while Office Depot jumped 21 percent to $9.24. Through Monday\u2019s close, both stocks had been down for the year, with Staples falling 5.4 percent and Office Depot slumping 11 percent. A deal would create a retail chain with more than $35 billion in revenue and thousands of stores, drawing scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The Federal Trade Commission previously approved the merger of Office Depot and OfficeMax, the industry\u2019s second- and third-biggest chains, in 2013. The question now is whether a changing retail landscape -- rife with competition from e-commerce sites -- means there doesn\u2019t need to be more than one major office-supply chain. Higher Prices? \u201cThe FTC\u2019s key question likely will be whether there is anything special about competition from office-supply superstores, such that reducing the number of competitors in that channel to one will result in higher prices to at least some consumers for at least some prices,\u201d Amanda Wait, a former FTC lawyer who is now a partner at Washington-based Hunton & Williams LLP, said in an e-mailed statement. Staples, located in Framingham, Massachusetts, had a market value of $11 billion based on Monday\u2019s closing price. Office Depot, based in Boca Raton, Florida, was pegged $4.1 billion. Kirk Saville, a spokesman for Staples, and Karen Denning, a spokeswoman for Office Depot, both declined to comment. Starboard, an investor with stakes in both retailers, sent a letter to Staples Chief Executive Officer Ronald Sargent last month demanding that his company engage advisers to work on a deal. The combination could deliver more than $2 billion in cost savings and help the retailers compete with larger chains and online offerings, according to Starboard. At the time, Staples gave a tepid response to Starboard, saying it had already met with the investment firm on several occasions to consider ideas. It didn\u2019t discuss its willingness to make a deal. Starboard previously pushed for the merger of Office Depot and OfficeMax, and investors have speculated that it could replicate that strategy with Staples. New York-based Starboard has said it owns about 6 percent of Staples and almost 10 percent of Office Depot. Doug Snyder, a managing director at Starboard, didn\u2019t immediately return a call for comment. This isn\u2019t the first time Staples has tried to buy Office Depot. In 1997, the FTC derailed Staples\u2019 acquisition of Office Depot as anticompetitive. By 2013, though, the agency\u2019s view had shifted. When the FTC allowed Office Depot to buy OfficeMax, it said the advent of online retailing ensured competition in the market for office supplies. Consumers today also rely more heavily on big-box chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. for office products, the commission said. \u201cOur decision highlights that yesterday\u2019s market dynamics may be very different from the market dynamics of today,\u201d the FTC said in its closing letter about the Office Depot merger with OfficeMax in November 2013. \u201cIn this case, significant developments in the market for consumable office supplies have led us to approve a merger when we had blocked a similar merger 16 years ago.\u201d While that decision opened the door to allowing a merger between Staples and Office Depot, the FTC will still closely scrutinize such a combination, according to Allen Grunes, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer who is now with the Konkurrenz Group, a Washington-based advisory firm that counsels businesses on competition, privacy and consumer protection law. \u201cIf there is a deal, it\u2019s going to get a very close look,\u201d Grunes said. \u201cIssues that may not have been present in the previous deal could arise, such as how the companies price.\u201d","timestamp":1422968014.0,"participant_ids":["SPLS:US","ODP:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-03\/staples-and-office-depot-surge-after-discussing-merger","subject":"Staples and Office Depot Surge After Discussing Merger"},{"body":" CVS Health Corp. will probably win approval from antitrust officials to buy nursing-home pharmacy company Omnicare Inc., according to lawyers and equity analysts, even after regulators stood against Omnicare\u2019s bid for PharMerica Corp. in 2012. CVS and Omnicare don\u2019t compete directly, which will ease the competition review, though regulators will likely scrutinize the increased buying power CVS will gain with more customers, said Amanda Wait, an antitrust lawyer at Hunton & Williams LLP in Washington. \u201cThere is no overlap. It\u2019s pure product-line expansion analysis,\u201d said Wait, a former lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cThis is a way for CVS to expand its reach into niche markets.\u201d The $12.7 billion deal comes more than three years after the FTC   Omnicare to block its $441 million takeover of rival PharMerica, a combination that the agency said would give Omnicare too much market power and increase drug prices for nursing-home residents. An acquisition by CVS, the biggest U.S. retailer of prescription drugs, will face a lengthy review but doesn\u2019t raise the same concerns over prices. \u201cThe FTC in the past has viewed long-term care as complementary and not competitive to retail,\u201d said Charles Rhyee, an analyst at Cowen & Co. \u201cThat\u2019s important that the FTC doesn\u2019t see this as a concentration issue.\u201d CVS, based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, said on May 21 it agreed to buy Omnicare, the largest nursing-home pharmacy business. The acquisition would allow CVS to add services for the elderly as the U.S. population ages. CVS is also the nation\u2019s second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, handling drug plans for health insurers and employers. Carolyn Castel, a spokeswoman for CVS, and Patrick Lee, a spokesman for Omnicare, didn\u2019t immediately respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment. About two months after challenging the Omnicare purchase of PharMerica, the FTC   by a 3-1 vote the merger of Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest pharmacy benefits manager, and Medco Health Solutions Inc. FTC Commissioner Julie Brill   the agency should have sued to block the deal, arguing it created a duoploy in the industry. She   last year that the industry had become even more concentrated since the Medco acquisition. Elizabeth Lordan, a spokeswoman for the FTC, declined to comment. While CVS will argue it doesn\u2019t compete directly with Omnicare, the acquisition still raises \u201csignificant competitive concerns,\u201d according to antitrust lawyer David Balto. The combination of complementary firms that don\u2019t compete head-to-head can still enhance market power, and antitrust officials have become more sophisticated about competitive issues in those types of deals, said Balto, a former FTC policy director. One issue that the FTC will probably examine in the CVS takeover is the ability of CVS as both a retail prescription chain and a long term-care pharmacy to gain leverage over health-care plans, which need both services, according to Balto. CVS could use its ownership of Omnicare to restrict plans from doing business with independent long term-care pharmacies, he said. \u201cInstead of being two different entities, now CVS is sitting there with two giant heads, saying you\u2019re going to have to deal with me because I control the essential longterm-care pharmacy,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1432645985.0,"participant_ids":["OCR:US","PMC:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-26\/cvs-deal-for-omnicare-seen-avoiding-pharmerica-antitrust-stumble","subject":"CVS Deal for Omnicare Seen Avoiding PharMerica Antitrust Stumble"},{"body":" U.S. stocks were little changed, after equities reached a two-month low, as banks rallied amid higher bond yields while airlines weighed on transportation shares and technology companies slipped.

Insurers joined banks in advancing with Treasury yields. Lincoln National Corp. and American International Group Inc. gained 0.8 percent. Netflix Inc. increased 3.2 percent to an all-time high, amid speculation that the company may announce a stock split at its annual meeting tonight. H&R Block Inc., the biggest U.S. tax preparer, rose 2.3 percent as   climbed for a third straight year in fiscal 2015 driven by price increases and stronger sales of do-it-yourself tax-preparation products. A Bloomberg index of U.S. airlines retreated 0.7 percent, after paring an earlier 4.2 percent slide. It was the group\u2019s sixth consecutive drop, the longest losing streak since October. Southwest Airlines and Alaska Air Group Inc. tumbled more than 3 percent. JetBlue Airways Corp. slid 0.7 percent to a two-month low. The Dow Jones Transportation Average briefly fell more than 10 percent Monday from its most recent high, temporarily meeting the common definition of a correction, before trimming its drop. Akamai Technologies Inc. fell 2.7 percent, its biggest retreat in more than two months, after Macquarie Securities USA Inc. downgraded the shares to neutral from outperform.

If lawmakers approve the most extensive   of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, it would remove an obstacle to returning capital for firms such as American Express Co., which has the largest percentage buffer over required minimums, and Capital One Financial Corp., which would have the most additional capital on a dollar basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled Thursday to debate a bill by Chairman Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, that would exclude banks with less than $500 billion of assets from being automatically designated as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs. If the measure becomes law and the Federal Reserve adopts similar limits in its annual stress test, regional and specialty-finance lenders could be freed from some of the toughest and most costly regulatory burdens. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake for these banks,\u201d said Jennifer Thompson, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC. \u201cTo the extent they can get any relief at all would be incrementally better.\u201d Thirty-one banks, including foreign firms with U.S. units, are currently designated as systemically important and must undergo stress tests measuring their capacity to withstand economic shocks. The Fed subjects those same firms to a second round of tests -- not required by Dodd-Frank -- that assess their ability to boost shareholder payouts and have resulted in them holding additional capital on top of minimums set by international regulators. If Congress raises the SIFI threshold above the current level of $50 billion, the Fed will probably do the same, said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities. Only the six largest U.S. banks have more than $500 billion in assets. While there\u2019s no guarantee the legislation will pass or the central bank will act, some Democrats and regulators, including Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, have said they\u2019re open to raising the level. Democrats on Tuesday published an alternative bill that would help community lenders without providing relief for regional banks. Sixteen U.S. lenders, not including custodial banks, would benefit if spared some requirements of the stress tests. The biggest 11 would have $66 billion in capital above their required minimums, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg, which is based on the companies\u2019 first-quarter regulatory filings. AmEx has $7.9 billion, or 6 percentage points, more than the minimum, while Capital One has an extra $12.1 billion, the data show. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. has $9.1 billion in such capital and U.S. Bancorp holds $7.3 billion. Last year, the 11 lenders returned about $23.8 billion to shareholders, including common dividends and stock repurchases. In addition to payouts, banks could also use the capital to invest in their business or for acquisitions. Regional banks would primarily use excess capital for expanding lending, said William Moore, executive director of the Regional Bank Coalition, an industry group formed in March to lobby for raising the SIFI threshold. Members include AmEx, Capital One and Regions Financial Corp. \u201cFreeing up that capital will let them meet more of the credit needs of small and mid-size businesses and consumers,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat\u2019s where these banks are focused.\u201d Increased competition from less-constrained regional lenders is one reason bigger Wall Street firms   to Shelby\u2019s proposal, according to bank executives and lobbyists. A compromise may be in the offing with Democrats open to raising the threshold, though not as high as Shelby proposed. If it\u2019s set at $250 billion, as some analysts expect, then eight of the 11 banks, including AmEx and regional lenders such as SunTrust Banks Inc. and BB&T Corp., would be spared a SIFI designation. That would free up about $38 billion of capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by Susan Roth Katzke predict the level will be closer to $100 billion, which would result in only Cleveland-based KeyCorp falling below the threshold. Wherever the bar is set, the bill still would allow regulators to designate banks below that level as systemically important after an elaborate process that gives firms a right to appeal. While being dropped as a SIFI would reduce banks\u2019 compliance costs tied to stress tests, lenders may not be able to immediately distribute all excess capital. Chief executives have historically preferred to maintain a buffer above regulatory minimums, often 1 percentage point. And even if they aren\u2019t SIFIs, the lenders will still face scrutiny from regulators, according to Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot more than the legislative language in Shelby\u2019s bill to change the tough realities of operating as a bank in the United States,\u201d Boltansky said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a hyper-regulated, incredibly rigorous supervision process for big banks.\u201d","timestamp":1432170000.0,"participant_ids":["COF:US","STI:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-21\/shelby-s-66-billion-capital-boon-for-u-s-banks-is-gift-to-amex","subject":"The Senate Has a $66 Billion Gift for U.S. Banks"},{"body":" The lawyers who pursued the successful antitrust lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association for not sharing revenue with college players are seeking far too much revenue for themselves, the NCAA says. Hausfeld LLP filed a motion in November seeking more than $45.5 million in fees and an additional $5.3 in costs and expenses for the time that 32 firms spent litigating the landmark case. The rates listed in the filing ranged \u201cfrom $985 for senior partners with more than 40 years\u2019 experience to $175 for the most junior associate.\u201d Not surprisingly, the NCAA opposed the motion, and on Feb. 6 filed a brief in federal court in Oakland, California, arguing that the fees should be cut by $36.9 million and the costs and expenses by $4.9 million. The NCAA lawyers, led by Robert Wierenga of Schiff Hardin LLP, argued that the fees were excessive because the plaintiffs hadn\u2019t prevailed in their original claims, because the firms had \u201cblock billed\u201d rather than delineating their fees and because some of the time spent was vague or otherwise ill-defined. \u201cClass counsel also impermissibly syndicated the case for its own financial gain with an unwieldy network of at least 34 firms. Many of them did very little work and added very little of substance, but padded the lodestar by billing thousands of hours of useless time,\u201d according to the NCAA brief. It wasn\u2019t clear why Hausfeld listed 32 firms while the defense said there were 34. Efforts to reach Michael Hausfeld and Wierenga Tuesday were unsuccessful. Hausfeld\u2019s firm for its part had argued that the lawyers\u2019 efforts were necessary \u201cto match the dozens of accomplished attorneys litigating on the NCAA\u2019s behalf, including partners and associates from WilmerHale, Munger, Tolles & Olson, and Schiff Hardin, as well as the hundreds of attorneys across the country representing the NCAA\u2019s member schools and conferences,\u201d along with other third parties and television broadcasters. In August, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in Oakland held that rules barring college athletes from seeking a share of the NCAA\u2019s $800 million in annual broadcast revenue violated federal antitrust law. The lawsuit, filed in 2009 by ex-college basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon, challenged the treatment of students as amateurs as college basketball and football evolved into multibillion-dollar businesses, with money flowing to the NCAA, broadcasters, member schools and coaches -- everyone but the players. While the ruling was a victory for the athletes, Wilken limited the amount of money they can earn and said the NCAA could cap pay, although not below the cost of attending school. The NCAA in November filed its appeal. The case is O\u2019Bannon v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, 09-cv-03329, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).

Emmerman, previously a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, counsels companies on mergers and acquisitions, financings and other transactional matters. Lipman and Baynham, previously partners at Nixon Peabody LLP, both specialize in white-collar criminal defense, securities enforcement matters, litigation and corporate governance. In an interview Tuesday, Lipman praised his former colleagues and said he wasn\u2019t looking to leave Nixon Peabody, but Brown Rudnick partner Stephen Best reached out and encouraged him to move. Lipman represents Wing Chau, featured in Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d who was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the purchase of assets for collateralized debt obligations. In January, the SEC in an initial decision fined Chau and his firm, Harding Advisory LLC, close to $3 million. Lipman is representing Chau in his appeal of that ruling to the full SEC. Lipman also represented Chau in his suit against the SEC to block the agency from using an administrative proceeding to handle his case. A federal court in December rejected the challenge. In an interview, Lipman said his client is still deciding whether to appeal. In addition, Lipman successfully defended Edward Steffelin, who was sued by the SEC in 2011 over his work on a JPMorgan Chase & Co. collateralized debt obligation that later defaulted.

No problem, said PharMerica Chief Financial Officer David Froesel. \u201cWe are now the only true independent company standing in this space, and we\u2019re dedicated to it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re very comfortable right now remaining as a freestanding business.\u201d PharMerica has no interest in courting a buyer like CVS and is happy staying put in the nursing-home segment of the industry -- even though investors seems to think otherwise, Froesel said. Its shares have shot up 53 percent this year, closing at a record $31.60 on Thursday. That gives the Louisville, Kentucky-based company a market value of $960 million. PharMerica has a long history with Omnicare Inc., the largest nursing-home pharmacy business, which CVS agreed to acquire Thursday. In 2012, Omnicare dropped an attempted $441 million hostile takeover of its smaller rival after regulators took issue with the deal, saying it would increased drug prices for nursing-home residents. While Froesel didn\u2019t directly address a question on whether regulators would reject the CVS deal, he said PharMerica wouldn\u2019t be hurt by it. CVS and Omnicare are in different markets, and acquisitions like this are common in many industries, he said. At Thursday\u2019s close, PharMerica is trading at 19 times earnings over the next 12 months, compared with 23 times for Omnicare. Six analysts advise buying the stock, three say hold and one advises selling, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For now, PharMerica\u2019s plan is to continue buying smaller institutional pharmacies and expand its specialty home infusion service. The company has about 15 percent of the institutional pharmacy market, while Omnicare\u2019s market share is about 40 percent, according to Froesel, who served as Omnicare\u2019s CFO from 1996 to 2009. That means there\u2019s still plenty of room to grow, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about the space we\u2019re operating in,\u201d Froesel said. \u201cWe see this as a great opportunity.\u201d","timestamp":1432236107.0,"participant_ids":["PMC:US","OCR:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-05-21\/as-cvs-swoops-up-old-suitor-pharmerica-s-single-and-loving-it","subject":"As CVS Scoops Up Old Suitor, PharMerica\u2019s Single and Loving It"},{"body":"  Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and Kirkland & Ellis LLP represented H.J. Heinz Co. in the approximately $46 billion deal to merge with Kraft Foods Group Inc. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP represented Kraft, while Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP represented Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which co-owns Heinz with Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital. Under the terms of the deal, Kraft shareholders will receive 49 percent of the stock in the combined company, plus a special cash dividend of $16.50 a share, the companies said in a statement Wednesday. Berkshire and 3G will invest $10 billion in the new business, which will be known as Kraft Heinz Co. It will have headquarters in Pittsburgh and the Chicago area, with current Heinz Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees remaining as CEO of the combined company. Leading the team from Cravath representing Heinz are partners Scott Barshay, Eric Schiele and Jonathan Davis. The Kirkland team representing Heinz includes corporate partners Jay Ptashek, Josh Korff, Bill Sorabella, Michael Kim and Nick Schwartz.

Cohen, securities partner Cathy Clarkin and antitrust partner Steve Holley. The companies prepared for the inevitable onslaught of investor lawsuits with one peremptory action: Kraft filed an 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday disclosing that it had adopted an exclusive forum bylaw mandating that shareholder suits be filed in Virginia, where Kraft is incorporated. Claudia Allen, a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP who specializes in corporate governance, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that it\u2019s \u201cnot uncommon for companies to adopt these bylaws when they\u2019re about to enter into a merger agreement. We see it all the time.\u201d Allen, whose firm wasn\u2019t involved in the deal, added that there\u2019s legislation awaiting the signature of Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe specifically to permit companies incorporated in the state to adopt these laws. A bigger question for football fans is the deal\u2019s impact on Heinz Field, the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 65,000-seat stadium. After the merger is completed, however, the field will continue to use that name, Bloomberg\u2019s Mason Levinson reported Wednesday. Once the deal has closed, the company will own many well-known brands -- everything from Heinz Ketchup to Kraft\u2019s Kool-Aid. Its revenue will be approximately $28 billion.

The company removed monosodium glutamate, or MSG, from its ranch dressing last year and pulled trans fats from its garlic sauce. Now Papa John\u2019s has homed in on a list of 14 ingredients, including corn syrup, artificial colors and various preservatives, that will be banished by the end of 2016. The ingredients are mostly in the chain\u2019s dipping sauces, which some customers use for pizza, and other items like chicken poppers. After high-profile moves by Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Panera Bread Co. to purify their menus, restaurant chains are under pressure to go all-natural -- and make sure consumers notice. Papa John\u2019s started posting its ingredients online this year, shining a spotlight on its food. But the push to remove artificial ingredients comes at a cost. In addition to the $100 million in added expenses each year -- the result of using higher-priced natural ingredients -- the shift has affected the taste of some items, said John Schnatter, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive officer. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to remove some of these things and still get the flavor and functionality you want,\u201d said Schnatter, the \u201cPapa\u201d in the company\u2019s name. \u201cWe gave up flavor on the ranch dressing because I wanted to get the chemical out.\u201d Papa John\u2019s latest push on menu transparency started after a food blogger criticized the chain\u2019s ingredients in 2013. To track its progress, the company created an internal color-coded \u201cClean Label Scorecard\u201d that compares it to Chipotle and Panera, two chains seen as standard-bearers for the natural-food push. Panera has spent the last year   from its food and reformulating its salad dressings. Chipotle, meanwhile, has eliminated   from its ingredients. It also debuted a marketing campaign that touts its use of simple, unprocessed ingredients. Larger fast-food chains are getting into the act as well. Taco Bell said last month it would eliminate  , and McDonald\u2019s has pledged to stop serving chicken raised with  . Papa John\u2019s is the third-largest pizza chain in the U.S. by sales, trailing Pizza Hut and Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. Pizza Hut, owned by Yum! Brands Inc., said last month it would remove artificial colors and flavors from its \u201cnationally available\u201d pizzas by the end of July. The chain previously eliminated trans fats and MSG. The movement has spread to the packaged-food industry too. General Mills Inc. said on Monday that it was removing artificial flavors and colors from its full lineup of breakfast cereals. Schnatter said his effort to clean up Papa John\u2019s menu has nothing to do with moves by competitors. It all started back in 1996 after he visited a factory in Kansas and didn\u2019t like how the sausage was being made, he said. Over the years, Schnatter made changes like removing fillers from the meat used for toppings and improving the pizza dough. The company also previously pulled cellulose, an anti-caking agent, from its mozzarella cheese. Each adjustment has boosted food expenses, he said. It costs more than $2 million just to serve pepperoni free of the preservatives BHA and BHT, Schnatter said. Papa John\u2019s, which has more than 4,600 restaurants worldwide, has long marketed its menu under the tag line \u201cbetter ingredients, better pizza.\u201d Its pizza is generally more expensive than the other major chains, according to Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cCustomers already give Papa John\u2019s credit for quality ingredients, as shown by their willingness to pay a dollar or two more for their pizzas,\u201d Halen said. Still, the bet on natural ingredients may not be a \u201cgame changer\u201d the way the switch to digital ordering was, he said. Ten of the ingredients marked for elimination at Papa John\u2019s will be gone by the end of this year, with the final four following by the end of 2016, the company said. That will put the chain in a position that\u2019s hard for competitors to match, Schnatter said. \u201cEverybody wants Papa John\u2019s quality, but they don\u2019t want to take the time or spend the money to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to spend a bunch of money to get where we\u2019re at.

The good news is that it will have no trouble affording one. The $75 billion drug developer is starting to experience what most companies its size eventually do: a growth plateau. Its pipeline of Alzheimer\u2019s and multiple sclerosis treatments may pay off someday. But until then, shareholders may push Biogen to join the industry\u2019s takeover spree. Biogen should buy a company that will immediately boost its revenue, according to a survey of more than 30 investors conducted by Asthika Goonewardene, a health-care analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., valued at $31 billion, was the favorite pick in the survey. \u201cInvestors think Biogen\u2019s top priority should be to acquire an asset that will have meaningful top-line growth within the next 18 to 36 months,\u201d Goonewardene said in a phone interview. \u201cSo, not one of those really small biotech companies that will only deliver something very promising five to seven years down the line.\u201d Biogen, which has little debt, may be able to stretch its balance sheet by borrowing as much as $22.5 billion and still keep an investment-grade credit rating, according to an analysis by Goonewardene and Amanda Lynam, a credit analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. They estimate Biogen could seek deals up to $75 billion, assuming 30 percent of the payment were cash and the rest were stock. That means Vertex, as well as $42 billion Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., may be well within Biogen\u2019s reach. On Thursday, Biogen shares gained 1.2 percent to $317 in New York. Vertex climbed 7.8 percent to $135.46 and Alexion rose 0.3 percent to $199.29. Kate Niazi-Sai, a spokeswoman for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen, declined to comment on the company\u2019s acquisition plans. Vertex is a Boston-based developer of cystic fibrosis medicines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration   its combination treatment for the most common form of the disease earlier this month. Analysts\u2019 average estimates show that the company\u2019s revenue will top $5 billion by 2018, up from $580 million in 2014. Alexion also focuses on rare diseases. Its one approved drug, Soliris, generated more than $2 billion of sales last year. In May, the company announced a $7.9 billion acquisition of Synageva BioPharma Corp. to expand its own pipeline. Meanwhile, Biogen\u2019s pipeline has faced setbacks. The shares dropped 22 percent on July 24 after the company   its 2015 revenue and profit forecasts. The stock is down 6.5 percent so far this year, headed for its worst annual performance since 2008. Sales of Biogen\u2019s MS treatment   disappointed in the first six months of 2015. The company also scrapped a drug to treat nerve pain after an unsuccessful trial. And it\u2019s considering whether to move ahead with late-stage tests of another medicine Tysabri for use in treating strokes after the drug failed to meet its main goal in a mid-stage trial. \u201cIn biotech, investors constantly need to see growth, and when things start slowing down, they get concerned,\u201d Brian Skorney, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a phone interview. \u201cIt becomes increasingly important to have an M&A strategy.\u201d Skorney flagged Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. and Acorda Therapeutics Inc. as two companies that may make sense for Biogen. Neurocrine is valued at $4.3 billion, versus Acorda\u2019s $1.5 billion. Both focus on neurological conditions. He cautions, though, that industry takeover valuations are climbing to a point where some people see a bubble forming. That means there\u2019s risk that some acquirers are overpaying for deals. There have been $224 billion of pharmaceutical and biotechnology acquisitions in 2015, a record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even Biogen could  , especially after its stock-price slide. Survey respondents cited Allergan Plc and Pfizer Inc. as the most logical bidders, though there are also reasons why neither may strike. Allergan hasn\u2019t traditionally focused on research and development, except for new uses for its Botox product.

In 2017, the biotechnology company plans to start final-stage trials of ALN-CC5 in patients with a rare and often deadly blood disease known as PNH. It\u2019s a space dominated by Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., which charges about $440,000 a year for its drug Soliris, the only approved treatment for the disorder. \u201cAlexion\u2019s drug is the world\u2019s most expensive,\u201d\u00a0Alnylam\u2019s Chief Executive Officer John Maraganore said in an interview. \u201cSo we can think about that space with a pretty high ceiling.\u201d The company hopes it\u2019s giving Alexion \"indigestion\" with the candidate treatment, Maraganore said at his office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\u00a0If the trials prove ALN-CC5 can treat\u00a0PNH,\u00a0or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a potentially fatal condition that causes clotting and anemia, being competitive on pricing shouldn\u2019t be too difficult, he said.\u00a0 Maraganore laid out his strategy ahead of Alnylam\u2019s investor conference that takes place Thursday, when the company will highlight trials of a number of experimental drugs for rare diseases. The drugmaker is looking to challenge companies that make treatments for the blood disorder hemophilia with two late-stage trials next year, and expects to file for its first drug to be approved in 2017 for a rare, inherited disease caused by deposits of an abnormal version of the protein transthyretin. Alnylam aims to have a total of five or more late-stage trials running by the end of 2017. Ritu Baral, an analyst at Cowen & Co., said that a head-to-head comparison study may be needed for Alnylam\u2019s candidate to prove that it\u2019s as good as Alexion\u2019s drug. \u201cIs it a drug in PNH in a world where Soliris doesn\u2019t exist? Yes,\u201d Baral said in a phone interview before the conference. \u201cIs it a PNH drug in a world where Soliris does exist? Unclear.\u201d \u201cThere is a minority of investors that think this could absolutely go toe-to-toe with Alexion,\u201d she said. Alnylam isn\u2019t planning a head-to-head trial, Maraganore said, nor does he see it as necessary for approval.\u00a0If Alnylam\u2019s drug for PNH is approved, the company may take a different approach to pricing than Alexion, which sells Soliris at similar prices in different countries around the world. \u201cGlobal parity is an important aspiration for any new medicine,\u201d Maraganore said. \u201cBut you also have local market situations that you need to be responsive to.\u201d Competition among expensive treatments can send  , as was shown last year when AbbVie Inc. came out with a hepatitis C drug that challenged Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s dominant therapy, which originally listed at $1,000 per pill.

If 2014 proved that the most promising new group of oncology drugs in generations could work, 2015 brings a crowded field that sees winners and losers in a market eventually worth $30 billion a year or more in the next decade. The treatments, known broadly as immunotherapies or immune-oncology, fall into two major categories -- drugs that help take the brakes off the immune response, going after solid tumors like melanoma and lung cancer, and customized treatments that modify immune cells to combat blood malignancies. \u201cI think 2015 is the end of the beginning in the story of immunotherapy,\u201d said Michael Giordano, head of development of oncology and immunology at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. \u201c2015 will be a pivot point where I-O will be mainstreamed beyond melanoma and we\u2019ll start seeing it approved and used in large tumors.\u201d There are 374 experimental cancer drugs in mid-stage trials, according to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics\u2019 global outlook report published last year. That\u2019s more than twice as many drugs as for nervous system disorders, for example. Of the experimental cancer drugs, about 25 percent to 30 percent are immunotherapies, according to IMS. In trials, Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers\u2019 drugs showed long-lasting effects in some patients that oncologists have called dramatic. There a huge unmet medical need from patients, for whom many new treatments extend lives by years, rather than months. And the financial reward for drugmakers is huge. The drugs have annual costs of $150,000, and a slate of personalized treatments are expected to carry even higher price tags. Kite Pharma Inc., Juno Therapeutics Inc. and Bluebird Bio Inc. have gathered interest from investors for their therapies to modify the immune system cells and retrain them to attack blood cancers, a technique known as CAR. Kite and Bluebird rose more than fourfold in the last year, while Juno\u2019s shares have more than doubled since their initial public offering last month. All three companies are scheduled to present at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco next week. Kite plans to file for regulatory approval for its treatment by end of 2016, according to spokesman Justin Jackson. Juno plans to file an application by late 2016 or early 2017, according to company filings. Bristol-Myers and Merck, meanwhile, are racing to expand their drugs beyond melanoma. They expect approvals in lung cancer this year, and are testing on a wide range of solid tumors. They\u2019re also pushing related immune-oncology drugs through their pipelines that will used in combination with one another. While their drugs have only shrunk tumors in about 30 percent of the population, combinations may help broaden their use. They\u2019ll have competition. In 2015, AstraZeneca Plc, Roche AG and Merck may all release data on new immune system mechanisms, according to Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Partners. In combination treatments, AstraZeneca \u201chas now advanced from \u2018dark horse\u2019 to \u2018major contender,\u2019\u2019 Fernandez said. \u2018\u2018Real leadership remains wide open.\u2019\u2019 Roche has more than 20 molecules in its immunotherapy pipeline, and looks to leverage the broad portfolio to craft combination therapies, Daniel O\u2019Day, chief operating officer of the drugmaker\u2019s pharmaceuticals division, said in an October conference call. Large drugmakers are also joining forces with biotechnology companies for their boutique blood cancer treatments. While questions linger about the cost and scalability of the CAR therapies, bigger biotechs and pharma companies are jumping into the fray nonetheless. There have already been four licensing deals adding up to more than $1 billion, including an agreement between Amgen Inc. and Kite valued at as much $525 per therapy, plus royalties. Celgene Corp. has a pact for as much as $225 million per product with Bluebird Bio, and Pfizer Inc. has promised Paris-based Cellectis $80 million upfront and milestone payments of as much as $185 million to share in their CAR program. Novartis AG is also working on the therapy. \u2018\u2018A new pillar of cancer care is now firmly established,\u201d Fernandez wrote in a Dec. 29 note to clients. As treatments begin to hit the market and new drug combinations and cancer types are explored, \u201cthings are just getting interesting,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1420935464.0,"participant_ids":["BMY:US","8211622Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-11\/drugmakers-pile-into-newest-cancer-treatment-classes-health","subject":"Drugmakers Pile Into Newest Cancer Treatment Classes: Health"},{"body":" Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u2019s experimental cystic fibrosis combination should be approved by U.S. regulators at the Food and Drug Administration, a panel of outside advisers said. The panel voted 12-1 that a combination of an experimental drug, lumacaftor, and Vertex\u2019s Kalydeco, which is already available, should be cleared for patients with the most common form of the lung disease. Vertex proposes calling the combination Orkambi. FDA staff last week   whether the combination works any better than Kalydeco alone. Members of the panel voted that because of the design of the trial, they couldn\u2019t determine whether lumacaftor added benefit to Orkambi. The agency is scheduled to decide by July 5 whether to approve the combination. Analysts estimate sales of Orkambi could reach $3.41 billion in 2018. \u201cGiven the FDA agreed to this design, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the patient to deprive them of this now,\u201d  , a panel member and statistician at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during the meeting. \u201cHopefully they can still possibly do this study post-approval. I also hope this will be a lesson learned for combination products.\u201d Vertex shares gained 7 percent to $132.75 after the market closed in New York. Trading in the stock was halted all day during the meeting. While the panel struggled with whether lumacaftor added benefit to Orkambi, it determined that the therapy improves lung function, so the individual contributions of the drugs may be less relevant. The FDA raised the question after seeing similar effects on lung function between the combination and an earlier trial on Kalydeco. Six members of the panel voted that they couldn\u2019t determine whether lumacaftor added to the benefit of Orkambi. Four voted that the data didn\u2019t show lumacaftor added benefit, and three voted that it did. The FDA didn\u2019t require Vertex to study whether Kalydeco alone might work after a trial used for earlier approval showed it might not be effective for the most common form of the disease. That trial was meant to measure safety, not whether the drug works. Prescribing information on Kalydeco advises that it isn\u2019t effective for the most common form of cystic fibrosis. \u201cThat probably was a bit of a hasty decision being made on a clinical trial that wasn\u2019t designed for efficacy,\u201d Anthony Durmowicz, a clinical team leader at the FDA, said during the meeting. The FDA approved Kalydeco in 2012 for use in about   U.S. cystic fibrosis patients who have a certain genetic mutation. Since then, the drug\u2019s use has been expanded to about 2,000 people. By combining Kalydeco with lumacaftor, Vertex is seeking to treat an additional 8,500 patients who are 12 and older and have the most common form of the disease. Cystic fibrosis affects   children and adults in the U.S., according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. It can be a fatal disease that causes patients\u2019 lungs and other organs to clog with thick, sticky mucus. Orkambi is targeted at patients with two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, defects in which lead to cystic fibrosis.

After four weeks of treatment, patients who took Vertex\u2019s VX-661 with Kalydeco saw a 4.4 percentage point increase in the amount of air they could exhale in 1 second, a measure of pulmonary function. At 12 weeks the improvement fell to 3 percentage points, Vertex said in a statement Monday. Investors expected improvement of about 6 percentage points, according to a survey by Evercore ISI that didn\u2019t specify a time period. The shares dropped 4 percent to $125.79 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 5.9 percent this year, compared with an 18 percent gain by the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. Vertex said it\u2019s started late-stage testing of VX-661, after a mid-stage trial showed positive results. The numbers are being scrutinized by analysts and investors who want to see exactly how much the combination treatment helped patients compared with other Vertex drugs. Patients with cystic fibrosis have defective or missing proteins that result in a buildup of thick and sticky mucus in the lungs, leading to chronic lung infection and lung damage, and often death by the mid-20s. An estimated 70,000 people worldwide have the genetic disease, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The combination of VX-661 and Kalydeco could expand the number of patients who can take Kalydeco and improve the results for those already on it. Kalydeco is only used in cystic fibrosis patients who have certain genetic mutations, representing about 5 percent of individuals with CF. Kalydeco helps proteins move through the cell membrane, and VX-661 complements Kalydeco\u2019s mechanism by getting the proteins to the right place. If the combination works well for all patients in the final-stage trial, the drugs might be used by as many as 50,000 people worldwide. Vertex received approval last week to treat an additional 300 patients with Kalydeco, bringing the total to 3,400.","timestamp":1427108597.0,"participant_ids":["VRTX:US","0210686D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-23\/vertex-falls-as-vx-661-cystic-fibrosis-drug-results-disappoint","subject":"Vertex Falls as Cystic Fibrosis Drug Disappoints in Trial"},{"body":" Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u2019s experimental combination drug may not have any additional benefit against the most common form of cystic fibrosis compared with the drugmaker\u2019s already-approved Kalydeco, U.S. regulators said. The questions raised in a a report released Friday by staff at the Food and Drug Administration will be discussed in a meeting of agency advisers Tuesday. The FDA is expected to decide by July 5 whether to approve the combination drug, which Vertex proposes calling Orkambi. At stake is a big part of the $3.4 billion in sales that Orkambi is expected to generate in 2018, according to analysts\u2019 estimates. Orkambi is a combination of the active ingredient in Vertex\u2019s Kalydeco, ivacaftor, and a compound called lumacaftor. The FDA approved Kalydeco in 2012 for about   cystic fibrosis patients in the U.S. Vertex has since gained approval to   its use to about 2,000 patients. Combining Kalydeco with lumacaftor, Vertex is seeking to treat an additional 8,500 patients who are 12 and older and have the disease. Cystic fibrosis affects 30,000 children and adults in the U.S.,   to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. It can be a fatal disease that causes patients\u2019 lungs and other organs to clog with thick, sticky mucus. Orkambi has a small benefit on patients\u2019 lung function though it\u2019s unclear whether Kalydeco alone would have had the same effect, according to a   released Friday by FDA staff. The FDA and Vertex had agreed previously that the drugmaker wouldn\u2019t study either ivacaftor or lumacaftor alone since ivacaftor, or Kalydeco, had previously proven less beneficial to patients with the most common form of cystic fibrosis than the rarer types it treats now, according to the report. So FDA staff did their own analysis of the studies, including previous data on Kalydeco. \u201cThe contribution of lumacaftor to the efficacy of the proposed combination product has not been shown,\u201d David Petullo, with FDA\u2019s Division of Biometrics II, wrote summarizing the agency\u2019s analysis. The doctors who advise the FDA probably won\u2019t be swayed by \u201cnuanced statistical analysis\u201d and will recommend Orkambi approval, Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients. If necessary the question of the benefit of the combo could be studied once the drug is on the market, Schoenebaum, said. Vertex shares rose 1.9 percent to $127.41 at the close in New York, bringing their gain for the year to 7.2 percent. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the European Union\u2019s drug regulator, may issue an opinion on the combination drug as early as this month, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Grace Guo. The opinion would be reviewed by the European Commission, which could issue a final decision within three months, Vertex said in a November statement. Orkambi aims to treat cystic fibrosis patients ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, where defects lead to cystic fibrosis. About   of people with the condition in the U.S. have two copies of the F508del mutation, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Vertex is   Orkambi in patients ages 6 to 11 who have two copies of the F508del mutation.

Until that\u00a0patchwork approach to the problem changes, working parents at all levels of the economic spectrum will continue to be in a bind.

Belenos Clean Power, which is controlled by Swatch and its founding family, has developed the battery with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, the CEO said in an interview Wednesday. The board of the venture, whose shareholders include actor\u00a0George Clooney, Deutsche Bank AG and its former chairman, Josef Ackermann, is discussing whether to list a 20 percent stake, Hayek said. The Volkswagen AG diesel emissions scandal is spurring interest in makers of batteries for electric vehicles. Executives at VW have said they plan a shift to more plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles after the controversy broke out last month. Swatch\u2019s CEO said Belenos\u2019s technology has applications in cars, drones, electric bikes and scooters. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about what happened with VW, but it is fueling the interest in us, since diesel is not the alternative anymore,\u201d Hayek said, speaking at Swatch\u2019s headquarters in Biel. \u201cThe car industry needs electro-mobility\u00a0more than ever.\u201d Companies from China, Korea and Germany have shown interest in the batteries, Hayek said.

The venture has about 50 employees and Hayek declined to give any financial details. Belenos can produce a battery that weighs about a third less than the Panasonic pack used in vehicles made by Tesla Motors Inc., Hayek said. Yet a car could run further on the Belenos battery, which charges twice as fast, according to the CEO.

Swatch will begin production in June through its Renata unit, which makes batteries for timepieces. Initially Renata will produce as many as 200 a day, in various sizes. The technology will be used and tested in e-bikes, drones and electrical scooters in 2016, and it\u2019ll be ready for cars from 2017, Hayek said. Nicolas Hayek Sr., Swatch\u2019s former chairman, helped design the tiny two-seater Smart car and later formed Belenos in 2008 as part of his side interest in developing a vehicle that would pollute less.

The provincial government\u2019s energy banker doesn\u2019t have a problem attracting cash -- it\u2019s finding a place for it all to go. \u201cOur phone has been ringing off the wall in the last three or four weeks with people wanting to come chat to us about our companies,\u201d Edgelow, vice-president of energy at ATB Corporate Financial Services, the lending arm of Alberta Treasury Branches, said by telephone Monday. \u201cCompanies like Apollo and others, are those type of companies. They\u2019ve got lots of capital behind them, and they are quite interested.\u201d The downturn has captivated U.S. investors from Blackstone Group LP to Apollo Global Management LLC, which envision a potential windfall from distressed debt of energy companies beaten down by the collapse in crude prices. They\u2019re being joined by Canadian-based asset managers such as Aston Hill Financial Inc. and CI Investments Inc. in a scramble for distressed securities they expect will post outsized returns as the price of crude claws back from a five-year low. \u201cWe all think that oil is going to bounce back and there\u2019s opportunity to make equity-like returns,\u201d said Steve Vannatta, a fund manager in Toronto at Aston Hill, who favors debt of MEG Energy Corp. and Seven Generations Energy Ltd. in the C$7 billion ($5.6 billion) of fixed-income and equity his firm oversees. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely interest in looking at these balance sheets. We see a recovery in the back half of the year as we start to see signs of a rollover in U.S. production.\u201d Betting on a rebound in oil started to seem less contrarian Tuesday as crude advanced for a fourth day,  into a bull market on speculation that curtailed output will lift prices. Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world\u2019s crude, closed more than 20 percent above its Jan. 13 settlement, a common definition of a bull market. West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude prices may average about $62 a barrel, and Brent $65, in 2015, based on data from the Bloomberg Intelligence investment survey. That assumes a recovery from current U.S. prices of $49.66 and Brent at $56.52. \u201cYou invest in a downturn and you\u2019ve got a lot more upside facing you, versus investing when all boats float,\u201d Alberta\u2019s Edgelow said. Canada, the world\u2019s fifth-largest oil producer, also has a debt market more exposed to energy than either Europe or the U.S. Almost one-third of Canada\u2019s high-yield bonds are from energy explorers, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. Speculative-grade debt of energy companies posted losses of 14 percent in the second half of last year even as Bank of America\u2019s Canada Broad Market Index gained 4 percent. The downturn has caught companies with viable projects as well as those that were carrying unsustainable debt loads, said Geof Marshall, who oversees about C$9 billion of high-yield bonds at CI Investments. \u201cThere\u2019s been enough baby thrown out with the bathwater that there are still pockets of value out there,\u201d Marshall said by phone Monday from Toronto. \u201cIt can be a good time to buy distressed energy names if you think oil is oversold and, due to the decline rates, has to go higher from here.\u201d Leon Black\u2019s Apollo is the biggest investor in the debt of Calgary-based Lightstream Resources Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company, which produces light oil from the Bakken region in Saskatchewan and Cardium fields in Alberta, suspended its dividend Jan. 19 and said low oil prices could threaten one of the terms of a C$1.15-billion credit facility before the end of the year. The Apollo Energy Opportunity Fund LP was set up to invest in \u201cless liquid or illiquid credit products in energy industries,\u201d according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 20 in Washington. Bud Perrone, a spokesman for Apollo with Rubenstein Communications Inc., declined to comment on the firm\u2019s position in Lightstream and potential Canadian investments in the new fund. Steve Schwarzman, Blackstone\u2019s chief executive officer,   investors last week that the timing for energy investments \u201ccouldn\u2019t be better.\u201d The biggest alternative-asset manager in the U.S. is seeking more than $1 billion to buy bonds of troubled energy producers and to provide rescue financing, a person with knowledge of the plans said last week. Marshall at CI has been adding holdings of Baytex Energy Corp. and Seven Generations, Calgary-based explorers whose assets are diverse and include light oil. \u201cSome will come in with equity, some will come in and put new debt in and some will restructure a whole balance sheet and be a holder of a combination of equity and debt,\u201d Alberta\u2019s Edgelow said. \u201cThey\u2019re quite prepared to take a variety of positions. They\u2019re not investing for a 12-month gain. This is not a quick flip.\u201d (An earlier version of the story corrected the rankings of oil producers on the third screen.)","timestamp":1423018827.0,"participant_ids":["1375Z:CN","APO:US","AHF:CN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-04\/distressed-buyers-stalk-oil-sands-as-crude-climbs-canada-credit","subject":"Distressed Bond Buyers Stalk Oil Sands as Crude Rebounds"},{"body":" Deutsche Bank AG hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. veteran Celeste Guth as co-head of its global financial institutions group.

Labour lost four elections between 1979 and 1992, including its worst post-World War II result in 1983, when it ran on a socialist platform later described by one candidate as \u201cthe longest suicide note in history.\u201d Blair then led it to three successive victories starting in 1997 by broadening its appeal to attract business support and encourage wealth creation. In the wake of its second straight election defeat in May and the resignation of Ed Miliband as leader, the party is now debating its future, with Corbyn, 66, the standard bearer for a return to the party\u2019s pre-Blair values. A   in Wednesday\u2019s Times newspaper showed 43 percent of the Labour electorate backing the former trade-union official as their first preference, a clear lead over rivals Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall. \u201cYes, move on, but don\u2019t for heaven\u2019s sake move back,\u201d Blair urged party supporters at an event in London Wednesday. He said Labour\u2019s current situation was like 1979, when Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan was defeated by Margaret Thatcher. \u201cThe Labour Party persuaded itself that the reason why the country had voted for Margaret Thatcher was because they wanted a really left-wing Labour Party,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what I call \u2018the theory the electorate is stupid.\u2019\u201d Labour\u2019s 1983 manifesto advocated unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Economic Community and a program of nationalization of key industries. Speaking to reporters in central London on Wednesday, Corbyn dismissed a comment by Blair that he\u2019s the Conservative Party\u2019s preferred candidate, saying it was a \u201csilly\u201d remark. \u201cDid we lose the last election because we were too left-wing or because we were offering an austerity-lite agenda? I welcome the debate,\u201d Corbyn said. Corbyn set out some of his economic plans in a speech to economists at a policy seminar in London on Wednesday. He said he\u2019d make large reductions in corporate tax relief, introduce stronger anti-avoidance tax laws and create a national investment bank to fund infrastructure upgrades. \u201cAusterity is a political choice, not an economic necessity,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cYou just cannot cut your way to prosperity, so Britain needs a publicly led expansion and reconstruction of the economy.\u201d Bookmakers reacted to the poll by cutting Corbyn\u2019s odds of winning. He\u2019s 2\/1 with Ladbrokes Plc and Paddy Power Plc, meaning a successful 1-pound bet would make a profit of 2 pounds. That makes him the second favorite behind Burnham.","timestamp":1437546074.0,"participant_ids":["3956452Z:LN","3956452Z:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-22\/blair-warns-labour-against-return-to-1980s-as-corbyn-leads-poll","subject":"Blair Warns Labour of Return to 1980s as Corbyn Leads Poll"},{"body":"Tissot SA will become the first official timekeeper of the National Basketball Association in a six-year sponsorship valued at $200 million, according to a person familiar with terms of the deal.\u00a0 The agreement calls for Tissot to develop a new timing system for the\u00a0NBA and to put its brand on the shot clocks in all 29 of the league\u2019s arenas.

The Calgary-based developer was granted protection under Canada\u2019s Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act to pursue options that include restructuring debt and selling assets, Southern Pacific said Wednesday in a statement. The company missed a C$5 million ($4 million) interest payment on its convertible debt last month. Fund managers say it\u2019s only the first early-stage developer to seek court protection as oil prices hovering below $50 a barrel threaten projects. \u201cThe current situation is certainly dire for many of those companies,\u201d Martin Pelletier, managing director and portfolio manager at TriVest Wealth Counsel Ltd., said Thursday by phone from Calgary. \u201cCCAA is usually the very last resort.\u201d CCAA is similar to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Southern Pacific said it obtained protection from the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta in Calgary. Oil-sands companies face some of the highest production costs in the world and even proponents of energy investing are turning away from them after crude prices slid more than 50 percent since June. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC allies refused to curb output of the commodity, triggering the rout that sent crude to $45.99 a barrel at 9:50 a.m. in New York, almost a 5 1\/2-year low. The legendary oil trader Andrew J. Hall told investors in his Astenbeck Capital Management hedge fund in a Jan. 2 letter obtained by Bloomberg News that it will be Canadian energy companies -- not U.S. shale -- that will be driven out by Mideast producers flooding the market with supply. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any exposure to the sands right now -- the whole sector\u2019s been beaten up whether you\u2019re a high-cost producer or a low-cost producer,\u201d Keith Bachman, who oversees $6 billion as head of U.S. high yield at Aberdeen Asset Management Inc., said by phone from Philadelphia. He has more North American energy-company bonds than benchmarks suggest, while avoiding oil-sands firms. \u201cNo one should be surprised that they\u2019re struggling to make money at these levels.\u201d Extracting the thick, gooey bitumen reserves that lie beneath the Alberta oil sands costs $60 to $100 a barrel, compared with $40 to $80 for a barrel of shale oil, Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane   an audience in Madison, Wisconsin Jan. 13. Aston Hill Financial Inc. was an early investor in Southern Pacific but grew wary in 2013 when the company fell short of production targets, according to Steve Vannatta, a fund manager at the firm. Southern Pacific\u2019s McKay project last year was producing about 29 percent of the oil the company had aimed to achieve by the first quarter of 2015, based on a December 2013 target, according to Desjardins Capital Markets. \u201cThe project wasn\u2019t working -- it was evident even then,\u201d said Toronto-based Vannatta, who oversees more than $7 billion of assets at Aston Hill. \u201cThe project never even reached a quarter of design capacity.\u201d Southern Pacific borrowed C$600 million since 2011, mostly to develop fields in the Athabasca oil-sands fairway, taking advantage of the lowest borrowing costs on record as central-bank stimulus spurred a reach for yield among credit investors. \u201cYou had yield-chasers ignoring the underlying risks, and now we\u2019re starting to see the consequences of that,\u201d TriVest Wealth\u2019s Pelletier said. Southern Pacific\u2019s C$260 million of 8.75 percent notes due January 2018 were quoted at a price of 25 cents on the dollar Thursday, suggesting investors expected to recover a quarter of their principal. The company is in talks with representatives of its first-lien term loan and holders of more than 75 percent of the senior secured second-lien notes and 50 percent of the convertible debentures, according to the statement Wednesday. Byron Lutes, Southern Pacific\u2019s chief executive officer, didn\u2019t respond to a phone message seeking comment. Connacher Oil & Gas Ltd., which operates in the Albertan oil sands, said Jan. 15 it was seeking a buyer to address problems with its liquidity and capital structure. The company isn\u2019t comparable to Southern Pacific because it produces significantly more crude from its oil-sands assets, Chris Bloomer, Connacher\u2019s chief executive officer, said Thursday in an e-mail. He declined to provide an update on the company\u2019s search for a buyer. Connacher\u2019s bonds have lost more than half of their value in the past three months. The company\u2019s $550 million of 8.5 percent notes due August 2019 were quoted at a price of 31 cents Thursday, down from 66 cents on Oct. 30. Bonds of energy explorers in Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s Canada High Yield Index lost 9.8 percent from Oct. 21, the most of 14 industry categories and almost three times the average 3.5 percent decline. Expansion by investment-grade oil-sands firms will still be profitable because of the long lives of the projects, while junk-rated companies wouldn\u2019t be able to generate positive earnings with North American crude at $80 per barrel, according to an Oct. 28 report from Standard & Poor\u2019s. Southern Pacific\u2019s rating was downgraded Friday by DBRS Ltd. to D, the lowest possible grade, bringing it in line with Standard & Poor\u2019s assessment. Connacher is rated two steps higher at CC by S&P. \u201cIt\u2019s all about surviving this downturn in oil prices,\u201d said Bachman at Aberdeen. \u201cWe sold some of our high-cost producers, and what we\u2019re left with are companies with low-cost, full-cycle economics and companies that have liquidity and financial flexibility such that they can survive this down cycle.\u201d Related News and Information: ","timestamp":1421982000.0,"participant_ids":["STP:CN","COS:CN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-23\/oil-sands-startups-ask-for-whom-the-bell-tolls-amid-slide","subject":"Oil-Sands Startups Ask for Whom the Bell Tolls Amid Slide"},{"body":" Metro Inc., the operator of grocery stores in Ontario and Quebec, is seeking acquisitions as sales and profit growth lags behind competitors. The Montreal-based company is considering expanding outside the two provinces and is ready to jump on opportunities similar to Loblaw Cos.\u2019 C$13.5 billion ($10.8 billion) purchase of Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. completed last year, said Roberto Sbrugnera, vice president in charge of treasury, risk and investor relations. \u201cThe transaction that was done with Shoppers and Loblaw, with pharma and food, we believe in that,\u201d Sbrugnera said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThat type of transaction would interest us.\u201d Metro, which runs about 600 grocery stores and 250 pharmacies in the country\u2019s two most-populous provinces, is the top-performing Canadian consumer staples stock in the past 12 months, with a 72 percent gain. The advance comes even as the company posted the second-lowest revenue growth among nine North American peers in 2014 and earnings before certain items below the average for the group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares are trading at the highest price to earnings on record. Metro slipped 1.6 percent to C$34.80 in Toronto. Metro\u2019s competitors have been making acquisitions over the past two years to expand their businesses and fuel growth. Empire Co., which owns the Sobeys Inc. chain of grocery stores, purchased the Canadian operations of Safeway Inc. for about C$5.8 billion in 2013. Its revenue surged 20 percent in 2014. Loblaw posted the strongest revenue growth among grocery peers in North America last year with a 32 percent increase, after closing its deal for Shoppers Drug Mart, the data show. \u201cIn pharma and food, we would look outside Quebec,\u201d Sbrugnera said. \u201cIt could be Ontario or even western Canada. There\u2019s a significant number of pharma players in Canada so that could be an opportunity for us for sure.\u201d Jean Coutu Group PJC Inc., the only remaining pharmacy operator in the Standard & Poor\u2019s\/TSX Composite Index, is not for sale, Sbrugnera said. He declined to identify specific targets and said a deal isn\u2019t \u201cimminent.\u201d Rexall Drug Stores Ltd., which operates more than 450 pharmacies across Canada, would allow Metro to establish a foothold in western Canada. Privately held Rexall is owned by Katz Group, based in Edmonton, Alberta. Derek Tupling, a spokesman with Rexall, and Helene Bisson, a spokeswoman for Jean Coutu, declined to comment. Jennifer Bartashus, a food retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Skillman, New Jersey, said outside of Jean Coutu there are other options. \u201cRetail pharmacy is very splintered but offers a lot of opportunities for acquisition,\u201d she said. Metro has climbed after posting four straight quarters of profit gains. The company reported better-than-forecast first-quarter earnings Jan. 27 as same-store sales climbed 3.8 percent, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2011. Metro also split its shares 3-for-1 and boosted its dividend, and is benefiting from a 5.7 percent investment in fellow Quebec retailer Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., which has rallied 67 percent in the past year. Much of Metro\u2019s recent success has been due to its in-store improvements, including sprucing up its discount stores, an in-stock guarantee as well as an effective customer loyalty program, Bartashus said. \u201cThey were one of the earlier Canadian companies who really looked at how to use loyalty data and how to tailor it to people,\u201d she said. Metro offers a mobile app, personalized coupons and Air Miles points for consumers. Shares of the company are trading at a record of almost 20 times reported earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Metro\u2019s 72 percent advance for the past year compares with 46 percent for consumer-staples companies as a group, and only 7.4 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s\/TSX Composite Index. Metro shares most recently topped a record Feb. 24. Analysts are projecting a pullback after Metro\u2019s strong 2014. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock is C$33.95, implying a 4 percent decline from current levels. Revenue at the company gained 1.7 percent last year, the second-worst among nine North American peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The 2.1 percent growth of earnings before certain items has also been below the 4.7 percent average, the data show. Metro, along with its competitors, is also facing rising food costs as a result of the plunge in the Canadian dollar. Food prices rose at the fastest pace since November 2011 with a gain of 4.6 percent in January as inflation excluding gasoline quickened to 2.4 percent, Statistics Canada   Feb. 26. In its most recent quarter, Metro\u2019s food basket inflation was 3 percent as about 60 percent of its produce was purchased in U.S. dollars. If inflation gets out of hand as the loonie continues to fall, grocers won\u2019t be able to pass on the rapidly rising costs to consumers, said John Kim, a fund manager at Aston Hill Financial Inc. in Toronto. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing some food inflation coming in with the dollar falling,\u201d Kim said. His firm manages about C$4 billion. Kim holds a long position in Loblaw and a short position in Metro. \u201cYou\u2019ll start to feel the effects of it.\u201d Food inflation coupled with successful merchandising strategies are paying off in increased sales for Metro, a trend that will likely continue, said Kevin Chu, a retail analyst at Accountability Research Corp. \u201cWe expect this strength to carry forward into the rest of 2015,\u201d Chu said in a Jan. 29 research report. The company is also in position to take on additional leverage, he said. \u201cWe can more than double the size of the debt we have right now,\u201d Metro\u2019s Sbrugnera said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to us is not jeopardizing our investment grade.\u201d An acquisition of Longueuil, Quebec-based Jean Coutu doesn\u2019t necessarily make sense for Metro as it already has a strong presence in the province, Kim said. Instead, Metro may explore a wholesale distribution business in western Canada to test the waters, he said. Greg Eckel of Morgan Meighen & Associates Ltd. in Toronto, which manages about C$1.4 billion, is skeptical Metro will be able to make an acquisition of the same size and impact as its rivals. \u201cYou see Metro and wonder where they go next,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wonder what the growth opportunities might be and it seems rather limited.\u201d","timestamp":1425351601.0,"participant_ids":["MRU:CN","SC:CN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-03\/metro-seeking-deals-as-stock-rally-faces-expiry-date","subject":"Metro Seeking Deals as Stock Rally Faces Expiry Date"},{"body":"Even with a heavyweight like\u00a0Apple Inc. in the market, smartwatches remain \u201cmore hype than reality\" and have yet to prove they\u2019re useful, said Fitbit Inc., the biggest maker of wearable devices. \u201cConsumers are still asking, \u2018Why do I want one? Why do I need one?\u2019\" said Woody Scal, Fitbit\u2019s chief revenue officer. Fitbit\u2019s wearable fitness trackers still have an edge over the more complex devices because they have a longer battery life, cheaper price range and a more clearly defined audience, he said. San Francisco-based Fitbit is aiming to maintain its dominant lead in the wearables market, where it sold about 4.4 million devices in the second quarter,\u00a0according to an August report by market research firm IDC. Second-quarter revenue more than tripled to $400.4 million from a year earlier. Competition is mounting, with China-based Xiaomi Corp., Jawbone Inc., and Samsung Electronics Co. vying for a piece of the action. Apple has beat analysts\u2019 expectations for its watch, selling an estimated 3.6 million units, according to IDC\u2019s report. Apple is holding a product event Wednesday where it will reveal a new version of its iPhone; the watch isn\u2019t expected to play a major role at the session. Fitbit users typically have clear goals in mind when buying a fitness tracker, Scal said. Though smartwatches also come with health-monitoring features, like step-counting, Scal said smartwatches\u2019 short battery lives put them at a disadvantage to Fitbit\u2019s products, which can go days without charge, meaning consumers can track their sleep overnight and monitor their heart rates around the clock. Apple has said that its customers love the watch -- 97 percent were satisfied with the device and said it was improving their health and daily routines,\u00a0according to a survey. \"The feedback from Apple Watch customers is incredibly positive and we\u2019ve been very happy with customer satisfaction and usage statistics,\" CEO Tim Cook said during a July conference call. Cook has said the Apple Watch is still in its infancy, in terms of applications and uses that will eventually be developed for it. Since its June 17 initial public offering, Fitbit\u2019s shares had gained 77 percent through Tuesday. Fitbit shares rose 3.1 percent to $36.54 at 10:43 a.m. in New York. Apple was little changed at $112.48. Scal also touted Fitbit\u2019s less-expensive prices, which range from about $60 to almost $250 for its newest product, the Surge, which comes with call and text message notifications.

The Stoxx 600 Banks Index fell as much as 4.4 percent, the biggest decline since November 2011. The gauge closed down 4 percent, eliminating most of last week\u2019s rally. Lenders in Italy, Portugal and Spain were among the biggest decliners, led by Banco Comercial Portugues, which tumbled 11 percent. Greece shut its banks and imposed capital controls to help avert the collapse of its financial system amid increasing concerns it will be forced out of the euro area. Banks will be closed at least until July 6, the day after Greeks vote in a referendum on proposals to restore bailout aid. \u201cWe are witnessing the maximum level of concern about Greece today,\u201d said Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer of equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which oversees about $284.7 billion in assets. The European Central Bank froze the ceiling on Emergency Liquidity Assistance to Greek lenders at just below 89 billion euros, refusing for the first time this year to maintain a buffer as deposits decreased. Greece is the second euro-area country after Cyprus to impose capital controls. Spain\u2019s Banco Popular Espanol SA fell 7.2 percent and Banco de Sabadell SA decreased 5.2 percent. Italy\u2019s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA declined 10 percent, while Intesa Sanpaolo SpA dropped 6.1 percent and Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl fell 7.9 percent. The prospect of a euro-area exit has returned \u201cswiftly to the market calculus,\u201d said Mark Burgess, who helps oversee about 341 billion pounds ($538 billion) as chief investment officer for Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Europe. \u201cIt is hard to see how uncertainty diminishes in the near term.\u201d Greek bank bonds dropped to the lowest levels on record, with notes sold by Alpha Bank AE and Piraeus Bank SA falling by about 35 percentage points to less than 43 percent of face value. A measure of financial debt risk across Europe surged by the most since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The costs of insuring bank bonds in Europe from default rose, with the Markit iTraxx Europe Senior Financial Index of credit-default swaps on 30 European banks and insurers increasing by as much as 28 percent to 98 basis points, the biggest increase since September 2008, before falling back to 91 as of 5 p.m. in London. While the risk of contagion has eased since Greece triggered a sovereign debt crisis in 2009, when foreign banks had larger direct exposures to the country, lenders remain vulnerable to the threat of a euro breakup. Some also face swings in prices on their sovereign holdings. Italian banks\u2019 stock of their country\u2019s sovereign debt stood at almost a record high of 415.5 billion euros in April, Bank of Italy data show. \u201cThe main impact on banks will be on their investment portfolios,\u201d Antonio Guglielmi, a London-based analyst at Mediobanca SpA, wrote in a note Monday. Banks in the rest of Europe will also be affected through fixed-income trading, with Deutsche Bank AG and BNP Paribas SA among the largest bond traders exposed to losses, he wrote. European banks\u2019 exposure to Greece is at about $45 billion, Bank of America Corp. said in a note dated June 19. HSBC Holdings Plc and Credit Agricole SA had the greatest exposure to Greece at the end of 2014, at 5 billion euros and about 4.2 billion euros respectively, according to Berenberg. Greece leaving the euro region would be a \u201cblip\u201d for British banks, said Scott Vincent, managing partner of consulting firm Parker Fitzgerald. \u201cThe exposure to Greece is absolutely minimal,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThe banking sector is well prepared for\u201d Greece defaulting or leaving the currency region, he added.","timestamp":1435556881.0,"participant_ids":["2539Z:GR","2539Z:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-29\/european-banks-losses-erase-44-billion-as-greece-shuts-lenders","subject":"European Banks Erase $67 Billion as Greece Edges Toward Exit"},{"body":" A specter of rising defaults marred the view of pristine peaks as Canadian energy executives gathered at the Whistler ski resort. Penn West Petroleum Ltd. and Baytex Energy Corp. told attendees at the annual conference last week hosted by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce that they may need to appeal to creditors to forgo debt terms. Two smaller explorers, Laricina Energy Ltd. and Southern Pacific Resource Corp., announced earlier this month they were in default. The oil slump that\u2019s knocked more than 50 percent off the price of crude is raising doubts that producers can meet payments on as much as $14 billion of junk-rated debt. \u201cBanks are being inundated with requests from companies to modify bank facilities,\u201d Mark Pibl, head of high-yield strategy at Canaccord Genuity Inc., said by phone from New York Tuesday. \u201cTheir exposure to the energy sector is being scrutinized so they can\u2019t be as accommodative as in the past.\u201d Bank of Montreal has   its energy loans to $35 a barrel for North American crude for this year, and at $50 a barrel for next year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this month that U.S. crude prices will drop to $39 a barrel, holding there for the first half of the year. Penn West, which is focused on the Cardium formation in Alberta, is seeking relief from lenders to meet conditions of about C$2 billion ($1.6 billion) in private bonds and C$1.7 billion bank credit this year, Dave Roberts, chief executive officer, told investors Jan. 22 at the conference. Earlier that day at the event at Whistler, North America\u2019s largest ski resort, Baytex\u2019s CEO told attendees he\u2019d be renegotiating terms on a C$1.2 billion line if prices remain depressed. As they approach lenders to renegotiate, oil producers are losing access to the bond market. The average price of U.S. dollar-denominated junk bonds from energy companies, 7 percent of which are Canadian, has fallen to 86 cents on the dollar, compared with 106 cents in June, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show. Borrowing costs have climbed to 9.6 percent from 5 percent since then. Laricina, a startup oil-sands developer,   this month it   a bond covenant based on its production levels. Southern Pacific missed a C$5 million interest payment on its convertible debt Dec. 31. It was granted   from creditors this month under Canada\u2019s Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Action to pursue options that include restructuring debt and selling assets. Paresh Chari, a Toronto-based analyst at Moody\u2019s Canada Inc., expects at least C$3 billion of loans to speculative-grade energy companies in Alberta to need relief in coming months. That includes Lightstream Resources Ltd., Korea National Oil Corp.-owned Harvest Operations Corp. and Baytex. Moody\u2019s said Jan. 26 it expects Baytex\u2019s talks with lenders on relief \u201cwill be successful\u201d and reduced its outlook on Baytex\u2019s debt to stable from positive. It could take two more quarters for the companies to fail quarterly covenant tests because they are based on a 12-month rolling average where the price swoon is offset by higher past levels, said James Jung, an analyst at DBRS Ltd. in Toronto who assigns ratings to oil firms. The price of Brent, the benchmark used by most of the world, has averaged $95.27 over the past year -- well above the current price of $46.09 a barrel. \u201cWe need to be talking to folks about relief throughout the year,\u201d Penn West\u2019s Roberts said, noting that the company\u2019s bonds and bank line require that its debt can\u2019t exceed three times the value of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the prior 12 months. \u201cI expect them to want to work with us.\u201d Lightstream is half drawn on its credit facility and expects lenders will work with the company to renegotiate terms, Peter Scott, Lightstream\u2019s chief financial officer, said Tuesday in a phone interview. \u201cIf you look at past cycles and if you look at what\u2019s happened with the natural-gas market in the recent downturn there, by and large the banking industry is looking to work with the E&P companies through those cycles,\u201d Scott said, referring to exploration and production companies. Representatives for Penn West and Baytex declined to comment further, while a request for comment from Harvest wasn\u2019t returned. Lenders will probably work with companies to renegotiate debt terms, because the price crash is beyond their control, said Gordon Tait, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in Calgary. \u201cGiven it\u2019s an external event, a sharp decline in commodity prices, it\u2019s different from a company that had really mismanaged their operations or drilled hundreds of dry holes,\u201d Tait said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the objective of these banks to own or operate oil and gas properties.\u201d If negotiations don\u2019t lead to new terms, creditors may tighten the purse strings, make debt more expensive, or force producers to sell assets to come into line. Penn West may try to sell oil-producing assets if that\u2019s required by bondholders, Roberts said at the conference. If the company gets the relief it\u2019s seeking, it will continue to advance drilling programs as planned, he said. The company\u2019s bank line is undrawn, he said. Baytex is counting on lenders to give it a break. The Calgary-based oil and natural-gas producer has already drawn C$700 million of its C$1.2 billion credit line, chief executive officer James Bowzer said. The loan was signed in June by lenders led by Bank of Nova Scotia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cWith the kind of history we\u2019ve got with the banks, with the kind of programs we have going forward, what I believe is a relatively small window of oil price recovery to stability, I would hope they would work with us,\u201d Bowzer said.","timestamp":1422414027.0,"participant_ids":["PWT:CN","BTE:CN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-28\/defaults-on-oil-loans-loom-over-whistler-ski-trip-canada-credit","subject":"Defaults on Oil Loans Loom Over Whistler Ski Trip: Canada Credit"},{"body":"Italy\u2019s bank-sponsored deposit guarantee fund will lead the rescue of Banca delle Marche SpA, the Italian regional lender that\u2019s under central bank administration, by backing a planned capital increase and becoming the controlling shareholder.

Department stores, after all, compete with shops owned by the likes of Gucci and Fendi and have seen their share of luxury sales erode in recent years as brands opened outlets from Beijing to Bogota. The same dynamic is starting to play out online. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and German fashion label   are shifting more resources to e-commerce as growth in China slows. That\u2019s setting luxury-goods makers on a collision course with Web distributors and could result in more deals like Yoox\u2019s merger with Net-a-Porter. The new company starts trading Monday. It\u2019s shaping up to be an \u201conline luxury turf war,\u201d said John Guy, an analyst at Mainfirst AG. \u201cThe level of competition is increasing.\u201d In the past year, a half-dozen or so companies have raised funds or reorganized to sell luxury goods online. Galeries Lafayette, the French department-store chain, plans to double profit by 2020 by becoming an \u201comnichannel\u201d retailer. Conde Nast Inc., the publisher of Vogue magazine, is rebooting fashion-review site style.com to sell luxury products. The online push has already spurred consolidation. Department-store chain Neiman Marcus Group Inc. last year   fashion retailer Mytheresa.com. Yoox\u2019s union with Net-a-Porter will create the world\u2019s largest luxury Web retailer. More deals will likely follow because distributors need scale to survive, said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. They\u2019re all seeking to capture more Web sales of luxury goods, which brokerage Sanford C. Bernstein predicts will grow at more than twice the pace of the overall luxury market, to 27 billion euros ($30 billion) through 2019. Until recently, luxury companies like Giorgio Armani and Valentino tended to outsource e-commerce because of the cost and complexity of selling online. Burberry Group Plc bucked the trend, keeping its online operations in-house. E-commerce accounts for about 10 percent of the company\u2019s retail sales. Now LVMH and Hugo Boss are going it alone online as well. In September, LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault hired a senior executive from Apple Inc. to spearhead his company\u2019s digital push, and earlier this year acquired a minority stake in Lyst, an aggregator of luxury e-commerce sites. Hugo Boss, meanwhile, is investing in technology to let clients order online and pick up their suits, ties and shoes from its outlets. \u201cThe industry is finally moving from dipping their toes in online to jumping into the pool,\u2019\u2019 said Bernstein analyst Mario Ortelli. While Ortelli estimates as much as 9 percent of luxury sales will take place online by the end of the decade, almost double last year\u2019s share, the Internet isn\u2019t just a battleground for revenue. As more shoppers turn to mobile devices to browse and buy, the Web is key for capturing customer data. That helps explain why Fendi, one of LVMH\u2019s 15 fashion and leather-goods brands, built its own e-commerce site this year. To give customers the flexibility to order how and where they want, \u201cthere was only one answer, which was doing it alone,\u201d said Fendi Chief Executive Officer Pietro Beccari. Luxury brands will likely continue to sell via third-party websites, just as they work with department stores because they help reach customers who wouldn\u2019t necessarily come to their outlets. Some will still rely on outsiders to manage their Web business. As the battle lines get drawn between suppliers and distributors, a far bigger combatant lurks in the background -- Amazon.com Inc., which has bulked up its fashion offer as it seeks more affluent customers. \u201cThe big gorillas are entering into our space,\u201d\u00a0Johann Rupert, chairman of Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, which will own 50 percent of Yoox Net-a-Porter, said last month. \u201cIf you want to play in that field, you have to have size.\u201d","timestamp":1444006800.0,"participant_ids":["BOSS:GR","MC:FP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-05\/luxury-web-battle-looms-as-lvmh-hugo-boss-develop-e-commerce","subject":"Luxury Web Battle Looms as LVMH, Hugo Boss Develop E-Commerce"},{"body":"Huang Wang isn\u2019t lacking for ambition: The chief executive officer of China\u2019s Huami Inc. is preparing to challenge Fitbit Inc.\u2019s global dominance with a string of new wearable fitness devices. The feisty startup and Fitbit\u2019s biggest Chinese rival plans to introduce the line of more sophisticated fitness trackers over the coming year -- at one tenth the price of the U.S. company\u2019s gadgets. \"Over the next year, our entire product line will be about the same as Fitbit\u2019s. Whatever they have, we will have,\" Huang said in an interview. The Chinese company\u2019s main product, a fitness wristband called Mi Band, sold 3.1 million units\u00a0in the second quarter, and was ranked the third best selling wearable worldwide after Fitbit gadgets and the Apple Watch, according to market research firm IDC. Huami plans to eventually take its new gadgets to Europe and the U.S., Huang said, without disclosing a timeline.\u00a0Huami was founded in 2014 with an investment from Chinese phone maker Xiaomi Corp., becoming its partner for wearable technology. Mi Band, which is marketed under the Xiaomi brand, is still mainly sold in China. Huami\u2019s new lines will have the same functions and features as Fitbit devices, said Huang, dressed in a casual grey shirt and sneakers for the interview,\u00a0which took place in a spartan meeting room in the company\u2019s office on the northern outskirts of Beijing. The 40-year-old executive majored in microelectronics at the University of Science and Technology of China, worked for about a year as a software engineer at Huawei Technologies Co., and built three tech start-ups between 1998 and 2013 before joining hands with Xiaomi to found Huami. \"Within two or three years they could easily come up with smart watches or other types of smart bands that could challenge any of the players out there,\"\u00a0Kenneth Liew, senior research manager at IDC said of Huami. Even so, the Chinese company is planning its expansion at a time when competition is mounting in the global wearable-device market. While sales of lower-end lines are likely to increase in emerging countries,\u00a0the majority of early users are graduating to smart watches made by vendors like Apple and Samsung that can track health data and run other applications from third-party developers,\u00a0Liew said. Fitbit is also making inroads into China. It has a Chinese-language website, and customers in China can make their purchases through e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and JD.com. The Chinese device maker is considering a third round of fundraising. But that\u2019s not an urgent need as the company had more than 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) in net profit each quarter this year, Huang said. In December 2014, after receiving $35 million in a second round of financing from investors including Sequoia Capital, the company said it was valued at $300 million. A third round \"will definitely raise over $100 million,\" said Huang. Huami is not formally planning an initial public offering yet, but will look into listing overseas, probably on the NASDAQ, within three to five years, he said. Huami\u2019s Mi Band mainly tracks a user\u2019s sleep status and steps, and the results are shown on a connected smart phone. Fitbit\u2019s devices, meanwhile, are able to collect more sophisticated data like the user\u2019s heart rate and many of them have display screens. Huang declined to give details on gadgets in the pipeline, saying only that they will match Fitbit products and advance toward tracking vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure. Mi Band, launched last August, is sold for 69 yuan ($10.85) in China.\u00a0It costs about 90 percent less than a similar Fitbit product without a screen, Huang said, adding that the prices of Huami\u2019s more advanced products will be as competitive. Huang says he sees Fitibit as his main competition globally, as both companies focus on relatively simple fitness trackers, as compared to Apple\u2019s multi-function smart watches. Huami hasn\u2019t decided whether to market the new lines under Xiaomi\u2019s brand, said Huang, adding that the decision will depend on the strategy that promises the best benefits. Fitbit, based in San Francisco, declined to comment on the Chinese company\u2019s plans. Seeking fresh growth, Fitbit is seeking to make inroads with   interested in promoting employee fitness and lower health-care costs. Tapping the U.S. corporate segment of the market is likely to be challenging for Asian companies, and will give Fitbit some protection from low-cost competition, Huang said. \"For cheaper Chinese wearables targeting mature markets the margins might be squeezed even more as service level costs are typically higher coupled with increased marketing costs,\" said Jitendra Waral, senior analyst for Consumer Electronics & Manufacturing at Bloomberg Intelligence. Pushing prices down will mean that Huami won\u2019t be able to count on large profit margins from hardware sales. It plans to make up for that by analyzing user data and connecting people to outside service providers, said Huang. An insomniac might, for instance, get a recommendation for a sleep therapist.","timestamp":1446472802.0,"participant_ids":["0334137Z:US","XIAOMZ:CH"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-02\/here-s-the-chinese-start-up-out-to-dethrone-fitbit-in-wearables","subject":"Here's the Chinese Start-Up Out to Dethrone Fitbit in Wearables"},{"body":" Banca delle Marche SpA, the Italian regional lender that\u2019s under central bank administration, repaid a 1.8 billion-euro ($2 billion) loan after Credito Fondiario SpA sold securities that guaranteed the financing. Credito Fondiario sold collateral including Banca Marche\u2019s senior bonds after the bank failed to repay the borrowing. The sale generated a liquidity surplus for Banca Marche, the lender said in a statement Thursday, without disclosing the amount. Banca Marche, run by administrators appointed by the Bank of Italy since a capital shortfall emerged in 2013, is seeking new investors and plans to raise cash by selling assets. Administrators have until October, when their mandate expires, to find backers to inject about 1 billion euros that\u2019s needed for the bank to be viable, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Credito Fondiario, which specializes in managing non-performing loans, last year started work on a plan that included a sale of new stock by Banca Marche to international funds and to Italy\u2019s bank-funded deposit guarantee scheme. European authorities favor a reorganization that doesn\u2019t involve the deposit fund, one of the people said, leaving the administrators little time to find an alternative solution. Banca Marche bonds fell to a record in May after the bank, based in the Jesi, central Italy, failed to repay the loan to Credito Fondiario. The two agreed to sell the collateral instead because the lender, being under special administration, can\u2019t access capital markets to roll over the debt, Banca Marche Chief Financial Officer Maurizio Bocchini said May 20.

Banca Marche, run by   administrators since a capital shortfall was found in 2013, is looking for new investors and seeking to raise cash by selling assets. Credito Fondiario, which specializes in managing non-performing loans, is seeking to rescue Banca Marche, which is hampered by the bad loans it piled up during Italy\u2019s longest recession on record. Credito Fondiario\u2019s plan, which it has been working on since last year, includes a sale of new stock and spinning off 2.6 billion euros of bad loans.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed an app that can track and measure seizure symptoms, and is the first research app to combine sensors on both Apple\u2019s watch and phone. Eventually, it may run in the background and alert caregivers that a patient is having an event. For now, patients will need to activate it before a seizure starts. Many patients experience an \u201caura\u201d warning of a coming seizure, which will help them turn on the program in time. Using sensors on the phone and watch, the app measures heart rate, movement and other data as the seizure progresses. The watch will also display queries designed to test whether the wearer is alert. The app is likely to be among the first of many research and medical trackers to monitor minute-by-minute symptoms from everything from multiple sclerosis to heart and metabolic conditions like diabetes. IPhone applications have   to track Parkinson\u2019s and asthma, and there are wellness and fitness apps that track activities like walking, running and diet. The Johns Hopkins app will let users record what type of seizure they\u2019ve had, map them over time, and may help them figure out what may be triggering them. The app can be configured to send a text message to a caregiver when it\u2019s activated, but can\u2019t do so automatically right now. \u201cThe idea is to try and capture all of that data and to train algorithms that can be used in a future app that will be detecting seizures and then notifying caregivers,\u201d Nathan Crone, a neurology professor at the Baltimore-based university, said in an interview. The Hopkins app uses  , Apple\u2019s framework for medical researchers who want to make use of its devices. It\u2019s a way of more easily gathering data on thousands of individuals than a traditional clinical trial might be able to. Scientists at Duke University, as well as the National Cancer Institute and Oregon Health & Science University, are also introducing apps Wednesday. Like the Johns Hopkins app, for now they\u2019re meant for research more than treatment or diagnosis. The Duke program measures how young children respond to videos, using the iPhone\u2019s camera to read their facial expressions and identify emotions. It\u2019s designed to figure out whether the face-reading technology could be used to screen for developmental disorders like autism, though it\u2019s not a diagnostic tool itself right now. An app from Dan Webster, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute, helps users track their moles. The program is part of an initiative with Sancy Leachman, director of the melanoma research program at Oregon\u2019s Knight Cancer Institute, to combat skin cancers. Using the app, individuals take pictures of their moles next to a standard-sized item like a coin. As people repeat the process over time, the app can figure out whether individual moles are getting larger. The app doesn\u2019t tell individuals whether they should have a mole removed. But if they do have one excised, the app asks for pictures of the wound as well. Eventually, that could be used to develop data on which moles individuals should be most worried about, the researchers said. Apple highlighted five other ResearchKit apps in March, when the company introduced its medical research platform. Those apps focus on conditions including breast cancer, heart disease and asthma. The Hopkins researchers say they hope to enroll a few thousand individuals in their app for the first phase of the research, which they expect to last about a year. In the future, they say their app could be used to monitor the side effects or efficacy of epilepsy drugs, to track whether individuals are taking their medications, or whether a patient\u2019s disease is getting better or worse.","timestamp":1444901417.0,"participant_ids":["AAPL:US","43935MF:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-15\/seizure-symptom-app-is-latest-apple-health-research-tool","subject":"Seizure-Symptom App Is Latest Apple Health Research Tool"},{"body":" Permira Holdings Ltd. is cutting its stake in Hugo Boss AG below 14 percent, boosting the clothier\u2019s free float in a move that may make it more attractive to institutional investors.

Instead, cash-strapped shoppers are turning to\u00a0online retailers for imported smartphones, jewelry and clothes, giving an unexpected boost to Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress site posted a\u00a040 percent increase in Russian visitors\u00a0to 22 million in July compared with a year earlier,\u00a0according to researcher TNS. JD.com, which gets more than half its sales from electronics and home appliances, started its first international site in June in Russia, exclusively offering devices such as Xiaomi Corp. smartphones for about $214. That\u2019s less than half of what an IPhone or Samsung Electronics Co. model\u00a0with similar technical specifications costs locally. \u201cAmid the recession, Russian shoppers are increasingly turning to the Web to seek the best possible bargains,\u201d said Maria Gracheva, head of online-payments operator Yandex.Money, which works with both AliExpress and JD.com. \u201cChinese online-stores can offer them affordable prices.\u201d Millions of Russians are sinking into poverty as the collapse in crude prices drags down the economy of the world\u2019s biggest energy exporter, sends the ruble into a tailspin and cuts government revenue. In August, wages fell 9.8 percent in real terms and Russians now face significantly lower disposable income than a year ago. \"The consumer\u2019s purse has shrunk by about half, but still Russians want good-quality products at affordable prices,\" Victor Xu, head of international business at JD.com, said in an interview. \u201cWe expect some strong growth in the fourth quarter,\u00a0before that we\u2019ve had more of a trial period.\u201d He declined to discuss sales numbers. While the economy may be in recession, Russians are embracing deliveries from China. Some 80 million people go online in Russia, making it Europe\u2019s largest Internet market by users, according to East-West Digital News. However, the number of Web shoppers is still about a third of that, compared with 70 percent to 90 percent in the U.S. and western Europe. \u201cIn China, we have 3 million orders every day,\u201d said JD.com\u2019s Xu. \u201cRussia is roughly 10 percent of the Chinese market, so potentially we could have as many as 300,000 daily orders here.\u201d This year, the number of shipments from abroad may exceed the number of domestic e-commerce packages in Russia, according to the National Association of Mail Order and Distance Selling, with the growth\u00a0driven by China. In 2014, 235 million parcels were delivered, including 75 million cross-border orders. This year, NAMO forecasts 220 million parcels with 120 million imports. AliExpress has seen a rise in consumers shopping for everyday household items in the past few months,\u00a0in addition to a continued demand for fashionable clothing, accessories and electronics, the company said in an e-mailed response to questions. While business is growing in Russia, Alibaba\u2019s reliance on consumer spending in China has left the company vulnerable to the domestic slowdown.\u00a0Alibaba surrendered the title of Asia\u2019s largest Internet company to Tencent Holdings Ltd. last month, capping a 10-month slide for the e-commerce giant that wiped $140 billion from its market value. While Chinese suppliers including Alibaba,\u00a0TinyDeal and JD.com are doing well in Russia, EBay Inc. lost 16 percent of its Russian visitors from in July, to 6.9 million, according to TNS. Many Chinese retailers use EBay to sell to Russian consumers, according to East-West Digital News, while the company also offers wares from the U.S. and Europe. An EBay spokeswoman in Russia declined to comment. The U.S. dollar has gained 55 percent against the ruble over the last year. An additional effect of the depreciation is that Russian-made goods are cheaper and more attractive abroad. Alibaba plans to start offering Russian food such as chocolate and condensed milk to Chinese customers from November, while JD.com is considering selling Russian seafood, vodka, jewelry and furs to China, Xu said. While many Russians in Moscow or St Petersburg cities shop online, in the country\u2019s far east, e-commerce has been slower to take off. In Blagoveshchensk, across the Amur river from China\u2019s Heihe, tourism flows have changed direction with the depreciating ruble. A yuan that buys 10 rubles, compared with 5.4 at the start of 2014, has made Chinese visitors wealthy. \"We used to go Heihe to walk, eat out and shop,\" said Maria Kobysh, director of a jewelry store in the city. \"Now we can\u2019t afford this anymore, while crowds of Chinese shoppers have started coming to Blagoveshchensk.\u201d Gold, gems and sweets and among the most sought after products, she said. Even this bricks-and-mortar commerce may soon move to the Web.\u00a0Bank of China-backed TradeEase started a Russian website last month to bring near-border trade online after Russian shoppers stopped traveling across the border.","timestamp":1444330860.0,"participant_ids":["BABA:US","JD:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-08\/facing-china-slowdown-alibaba-and-jd-find-solace-in-russia","subject":"Facing China Slowdown, Alibaba and JD Find Solace in Russia"},{"body":"Things were going so well for Xiaomi Corp. Customers were lining up, investors were swooning and the Beijing-based startup closed funding at a $45 billion valuation. That was last year. Now the high-flying smartphone maker is stumbling. Founder Lei Jun\u2019s latest business, one of China\u2019s most exciting startup stories of the past few years, is likely to miss its own goal of selling 80 million smartphones this year, according to two people with knowledge of its production plans. Suppliers also cut their internal targets for Xiaomi in anticipation of the shortfall, they said. Xiaomi\u2019s falter shows the startup\u2019s challenge in trying to maintain momentum after a meteoric ascent past\u00a0Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in China. Investors bought into the company\u2019s story of youthful disruption and online sales, yet the subsequent   of China\u2019s growth target and the copying of its sales strategy by rivals have neutralized Xiaomi\u2019s first-mover advantage, putting its high price tag in doubt. \"All those expectations of growth aren\u2019t being realized, which now makes that $45 billion valuation unfeasible,\" said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in Hong Kong. \"The argument was that their business is kind of like Apple and they\u2019re growing very fast, but they\u2019re no longer growing so fast and they\u2019re not as good as Apple.\" Xiaomi doesn\u2019t provide exact shipment targets to its suppliers, instead working on a real-time basis with orders fulfilled as they come in on Xiaomi\u2019s website. Yet the companies tasked with preparing the components and capacity to meet Xiaomi\u2019s needs have started scaling back production and diverting resources elsewhere, said the people, who have knowledge of the supply chain and asked not to be identified because the details are private. Domestic shipments of Xiaomi smartphones, including its premium Mi 4 and more economical Redmi series, dropped 8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its first-ever decline, according to  . IHS, another research firm, estimates that Xiaomi shipments dropped 3.9 percent, barely maintaining the lead over Huawei Technologies Co. That\u2019s a big change from the bold growth projections used to justify Xiaomi\u2019s tag as one of the world\u2019s most-valuable technology startups.\u00a0In March of last year, Lei   selling 100 million smartphones in 2015. Through the first nine months of this year, Xiaomi shipped about 53 million smartphones. With its optimistic forecast, Xiaomi secured $1.1 billion in December from investors including GIC Pte., All-Stars Investment Ltd. and DST. Xiaomi drew comparisons to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the Chinese e-commerce company that months earlier held the largest initial public offering ever. At 3.75 times last year\u2019s $12 billion in  , Xiaomi\u2019s fundraising gave it a price-to-sales ratio exceeding that of Apple, which currently trades at 2.9. That pricing of Xiaomi does not seem to have been based on any known or accepted valuation methodology,\u00a0said Peter Fuhrman, chairman and CEO of China First Capital. \"Hype and hope seem to have been the two key drivers,\" he said. In March, after that round of funding and after China   its lowest growth target in 15 years, Lei   his earlier prediction to \"80 million to 100 million\" units for the year. Its first year-on-year decline came during a quarter when Xiaomi released its Redmi Note 2, a lower-priced handset that sold for an   of 801 yuan ($125) each. On Tuesday it unveiled a metallic version of that phone with a fingerprint sensor, as well as a new tablet computer and air purifier. Growth might be reignited in the fourth quarter by China\u2019s Nov. 11 Singles\u2019 Day shopping promotions and the latest version of the Redmi Note. The company, which traditionally unveils an update to its marquee Mi smartphones during the third quarter, hasn\u2019t yet announced a Mi 5 after last year\u2019s Mi 4. \u201cI am not concerned about the valuation because, over time, their market is substantial,\u201d said Hans Tung, managing partner at Xiaomi investor GGV Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cOver the next 12 months, it\u2019ll become increasingly obvious what Xiaomi is doing in the smart home and services space.\u201d Hugo Barra, a Xiaomi vice president, declined to comment on shipment targets or valuations and referred questions to Chief Financial Officer Shou Zi Chew, who didn\u2019t reply to an e-mail seeking comment. Xiaomi eschews the label of smartphone maker, claiming instead   an \"Internet company\u201d furnishing a range of devices and online services. Xiaomi and its affiliates sell TVs, air filters, battery packs, action cameras, fitness trackers and even a self-balancing scooter. Its non-hardware offerings include games, payments, mobile-phone services and cloud storage. It\u2019s those other products, such as the Mi Air Purifier 2 released this week, which Tung sees helping Xiaomi expand its sales and keeping consumers coming back to an ecosystem that connects home devices to the Internet and through mobile apps. The ancillary businesses are still relatively small, with the company expecting the services units to account for just $1 billion of its $16 billion in projected revenue this year, Barra said in a July interview. Sales of smartphones outside China accounted for just 7 percent of its total in the third quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. Xiaomi has struggled partly because competitors Huawei, Lenovo Group Ltd. and  \u00a0-- among others -- quickly copied its business model with ultra-thin devices, glossy websites and lower prices, allowing consumers to easily switch to the hippest new phone. \"Xiaomi was very popular because it was the first brand that marketed its phones as being limited edition,\" said Chen Si, a 25-year-old real estate worker in Beijing who bought the Mi 3 after its 2013 release, citing its cool design. \"I wouldn\u2019t say I am loyal to Xiaomi, I just think that a phone should be affordable and easy to use. If not, then I\u2019ll just change.\" A year later, she switched to the iPhone 6.","timestamp":1448442000.0,"participant_ids":["XIAOMZ:CH","AAPL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-25\/xiaomi-s-45-billion-valuation-seen-unfeasible-as-growth-cools","subject":"Xiaomi's $45 Billion Valuation Seen `Unfeasible' as Growth Cools"},{"body":" Canadian energy producers such as Whitecap Resources Inc. and Cardinal Energy Ltd. may tap equity markets to fund acquisitions as the oil price collapse spurs deals. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more equity financings,\u201d John Stephenson, chief executive officer of Stephenson & Co., said Tuesday by e-mail. \u201cWhitecap and Cardinal will be the likely active consolidators and they will need to raise capital.\u201d Oil prices at five-year lows are crimping cash flow for energy producers, which are selling shares to fund spending plans. Last week, for example, Cenovus Energy Inc. announced an equity financing of C$1.5 billion ($1.2 billion). Consolidators also are selling shares, including Raging River Exploration Inc., which raised C$88.3 million this month before an asset acquisition in Saskatchewan. Future equity financings may be used to fund capital programs, acquisitions and repay debt, Greg Dean, Toronto-based fund manager at Cambridge Global Asset Management, said in a Feb. 23 interview. Producers are more likely to acquire assets than entire companies, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s split between the haves and the have-nots,\u201d Dean said. \u201cThe haves are being opportunistic with financings, the have-nots have bad balance sheets that need to be fixed and will need to sell assets and\/or cut dividends.\u201d Other potential buyers that may raise equity to fund purchases include Crescent Point Energy Corp., Vermilion Energy Inc., Kelt Exploration Ltd. and Tourmaline Oil Corp., Robert Pare, an analyst at Clarus Securities Inc. in Calgary, said in a Feb. 20 e-mail. \u201cWe are always looking at various asset and corporate acquisitions but certainly nothing imminent,\u201d Scott Kirker, a Tourmaline spokesman, said in an e-mail Wednesday. \u201cSo we have no plans to raise capital for that purpose at the moment.\u201d Cardinal is looking for asset acquisitions, but has no plans \u201cat this time\u201d to raise capital, Scott Ratushny, the company\u2019s chairman and CEO, said in an e-mail Wednesday.

European and U.S. equity-index futures jumped on Friday after the proposal was submitted to creditor institutions late on Thursday. The package of spending cuts, pension savings and tax increases almost mirrored that from creditors on June 26, which was rejected by Greek voters in a July 5 referendum. It will face its first hurdle in the Greek Parliament on Friday. Though Tsipras ceded ground, he insists long-term debt needs to be made more manageable to allow Greece to recover from a crisis that has erased a quarter of its economy. He has a growing support base that includes the U.S., European Union President Donald Tusk and the International Monetary Fund. \u201cWe are definitely closer to a deal than ever, as Tsipras has in the end given in,\u201d said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington, citing concessions such as speeding up the pension reform to start next year. Markets shared optimism that a deal was near. The euro strengthened 0.7 percent to $1.1110 as of 8:36 a.m. in Frankfurt. Italian 10-year government bond yields dropped to the lowest level in five weeks, while those on German 10-year bunds, the euro-area benchmark, climbed as investors retreated from perceived safety. Risks would remain if an agreement is reached, ABN Amro Bank NV economist Nick Kounis wrote in a note. \u201cThe deal would still need to be passed through various national parliaments,\u201d Kounis wrote. \u201cEven if it is passed, there is a risk that Greece finds it difficult to stick to the program in coming months. The economy looks set for a sharp contraction, which is not the ideal background to be implementing tough measures.\u201d It remains to be seen if the reforms are enough to appease the trio of creditors. A summit of EU leaders on Sunday will likely have the final say on whether the debt-addled country will get a new three-year loan. Deutsche Bank AG strategist George Saravelos said in a note to clients that a first reading of the proposals found them to be constructive and indicative of government willingness to reach an agreement. \u201cFurther progress on both the domestic and European fronts today would bring us a step closer to agreement over the weekend,\u201d he said. For Greece, time is of the essence. Two weeks of bank closures and capital controls have piled on to the economic misery of its 11 million citizens, who voted so overwhelmingly against more austerity. The Greek government said it would use the loan from the European Stability Mechanism to cover debt repayments between 2015 and 2018, mostly to the IMF and the European Central Bank. It will then be left with debt owed only to EU institutions. Greece\u2019s proposal includes creditors\u2019 longstanding demands for sales tax increases and cuts in public spending on pensions. Greece also proposes the restructuring of its debt and a package of growth measures of 35 billion euros. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who leads the country that has been the biggest contributor to Greece\u2019s bailouts, is coming under mounting pressure to soften her position on debt relief for Greece. Germany\u2019s resistance to it has been a major obstacle to a deal. \u201cA realistic proposal from Greece will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors,\u201d Tusk told reporters in Luxembourg on Thursday. \u201cOnly then will we have a win-win situation.\u201d Whether Greece can expect a writedown of its outstanding debts, which exceed 170 percent of gross domestic product, is another matter. Nevertheless, it will likely be addressed. \u201cWe think debt relief of some form will be on the table,\u201d but structured in a fashion capable of winning German backing, Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Michael Michaelides said in a research report. Even if Tsipras and creditors can reach a basic agreement, his greatest challenge may still lie at home. On Friday morning, he\u2019ll meet lawmakers of the ruling Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, to discuss the offer. The party was elected in January after it promised to fight the successive spending cuts and tax hikes that had been required for previous bailouts. \u201cIt seems quite likely that Tsipras will have to rely on opposition votes for this to pass, which means that from his personal perspective the referendum actually did a lot of good, as he is now the only credible leader of a national unity government,\u201d Kirkegaard said in an e-mail.","timestamp":1436483103.0,"participant_ids":["2539Z:GR","2539Z:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-10\/greece-seeks-eu53-5-billion-bailout-as-tsipras-bows-to-demands","subject":"Greece Seeks $59.2 Billion Bailout as Tsipras Bows to Demands"},{"body":" Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman is bidding $2.8 billion to boost his stake in Turkey\u2019s biggest mobile carrier, seeking to buy out boardroom rival Mehmet Emin Karamehmet to increase his influence at the phone operator. Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd., a Fridman company, offered to buy 51 Group B shares of a joint venture, or an indirect 13.76 percent of the carrier Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, for $54.9 million apiece from Cukurova Telecom Holdings Ltd., according to a public filing by Alfa Tuesday in Istanbul. The offer values Turkcell at almost twice at its market capitalization. The offer is unlikely to succeed because Turkey\u2019s government has signaled that it wants the carrier to keep Turkish owners, Vera Sutedja, an Vienna-based analyst at Erste Group, said in an e-mailed note. Alfa\u2019s offer for the stake in Turkcell, founded by Cukurova Holding AS Chairman Karamehmet, will need the consent of both Cukurova and state lender TC Ziraat Bankasi AS, which holds Turkcell shares as collateral on a $1.6 billion loan secured by Cukurova in 2014. \u201cWe think that the likelihood the Turkish state would allow the deal as minimum,\u201d Sutedja said. \u201cWhy would the state appoint Ziraat Bank to bail out Cukurova in the first place? We see a clear message from the state during the bailout of Cukurova in 2014 that it would be of the state\u2019s interest to keep Turkcell ownership in Turkey.\u201d Cukurova officials declined to comment. A Ziraat Bank spokesman, who asked not to be named because of policy, said the lender doesn\u2019t have an immediate comment on the matter. Stuart Bruseth, a London-based spokesman for billionaire Fridman\u2019s Letter One which controls Alfa\u2019s assets, declined to comment. Turkcell has been at the center of a dispute between the three main shareholders -- Alfa, Cukurova, and TeliaSonera AB -- after Alfa seized a Turkcell stake when it said Cukurova defaulted on a 2005 loan agreement for which the shares were pledged as collateral. Privy Council, a court for such disputes,   the disagreement in 2013, allowing Cukurova to find loans to   $1.6 billion of debt to Alfa. Alfa already owns 13.2 percent of Turkcell and Swedish phone carrier TeliaSonera holds 38 percent. Turkcell has failed to pay dividends since 2010 because of the dispute among shareholders. Turkcell shares rose as much as 3.6 percent in Istanbul, the steepest intraday advance since Feb. 11, and were trading 2.4 percent higher at 12.85 liras at 5:12 p.m., valuing the company at 28.3 billion liras ($10.8 billion). Alfa\u2019s offer values the company at $20.3 billion, more than the value of VimpelCom Ltd., in which a Fridman company has a majority stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Crescent Point completed seven acquisitions worth C$1.9 billion ($1.6 billion) in the 15 months after oil plunged in 2008, among the more than 35 acquisitions in Canada in the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts are watching the company after two rivals secured purchases in Saskatchewan, where Crescent Point is the largest producer. Companies have put at least $80 billion of North American energy assets up for sale, according to IHS Inc., after crude prices fell by half in 2014. Both recent deals in Saskatchewan included assets that would have fit with Crescent Point, said Chris Cox, an analyst at Raymond James Ltd. in Calgary. Whitecap Resources Inc. bought Beaumont Energy Inc. last month and TORC Oil & Gas Ltd. acquired properties from Surge Energy Inc. this week. Saxberg reiterated he\u2019s interested in the assets of another Canadian producer, Lightstream Resources Ltd., which said in December it plans to sell its properties in the Bakken shale formation. He\u2019s biding his time after Lightstream CEO John Wright made it clear the process wouldn\u2019t be a  . Crescent Point paid C$328 million last September for nearby land from Lightstream. \u201cWe\u2019d love to own those assets at some point,\u201d Saxberg said. \u201cThe challenge that Lightstream has in this environment is obviously their debt, the value of their assets and the commodity price.\u201d Analysts such as John Stephenson, CEO of money manager Stephenson & Co. in Toronto, said Crescent Point is also the likely buyer of properties owned by Legacy Oil + Gas Inc., which is being   to break up or sell land by an activist investor. Legacy CEO Trent Yanko declined to comment in an e-mail and representatives for Lightstream didn\u2019t return phone and e-mail messages. Crescent Point has always taken its time with deals and the string of purchases in 2008 and 2009 were years in the making and meant to consolidate operations in one area, Saxberg said. The deals helped expand the company\u2019s reserves to the equivalent of 528.1 million barrels by the end of 2014 and drive its current market value to more than C$14 billion, the sixth-largest energy producer by market value in Canada. Crescent Point reported net income of C$121.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The company\u2019s shares have gained 19 percent this year, compared with the 5.3 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s\/TSX energy index. As it weighs acquisitions, Crescent Point has enough of its own land to keep busy, Saxberg said. The company was the most active driller in Canada last year, according to a tally of meters drilled by JuneWarren-Nickle\u2019s Energy Group\u2019s Daily Oil Bulletin. \u201cWe\u2019re patient,\u201d said Saxberg, who added he\u2019s also looking for deals in the U.S., key to the company\u2019s long-term growth plans. \u201cWe obviously want to do transactions that are accretive and make our company stronger.\u201d","timestamp":1430355660.0,"participant_ids":["CPG:CN","LTS:CN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-30\/crescent-point-ceo-plans-saskatchewan-deals-in-crude-rout","subject":"Crescent Point CEO Plans Saskatchewan Deals in Crude Rout"},{"body":" Banks must go digital or die, says the chairman of Spain\u2019s second-largest lender. Francisco Gonzalez, who has been warning for almost a decade of the technological transformation set to engulf the financial industry, said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Wednesday that his bank would define itself as a software company. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA has spent about 3.2 billion euros ($3.6 billion) on technology since 2011 to expand online and mobile-banking services and prepare for what Gonzalez has described as an existential threat from firms like Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon Inc. \u201cThe greater part of banks -- thousands of banks -- is going to disappear slowly in coming years,\u201d he said last month at BBVA\u2019s earnings press conference. When one of the Internet giants jumps into banking, \u201cmany people are going to realize what we\u2019re talking about, that there\u2019s a revolution going on,\u201d said Gonzalez, 70, who declined to comment for this article. The bank is investing in financial technology firms such as Coinbase Inc., a provider of digital wallets for spending and receiving bitcoins, and cloud computing startup Madiva Soluciones. Last year it bought Portland, Oregon-based Simple in a deal valuing the digital banking company at $117 million. \u201cWe are turning a bank into a digital house -- it\u2019s a long journey,\u201d Gonzalez said today. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right tools, you can\u2019t compete.\u201d The investments differentiate BBVA from competitors, even if they haven\u2019t made much difference to the bottom line yet, said Arturo Bris, a professor at the Lausanne-based IMD business school. \u201cThe future is about big data, bitcoin, so many things that we don\u2019t even know if they exist now,\u201d Bris said by phone. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a direct impact on the bank\u2019s results, that will take time to happen, but it will happen.\u201d Angel Cano, BBVA\u2019s chief operating officer, attributed a drop in costs at the Spanish unit last year in part to the bank\u2019s digital push. Not everyone is persuaded the effort will bear fruit. \u201cSo far, this is the only tangible benefit of the bank\u2019s digital strategy,\u201d said David Vaamonde, an analyst at MainFirst Bank in Madrid who rates the stock neutral. \u201cIn our view, the market is still somewhat skeptical of what the bet on technology will mean for BBVA.\u201d As long as Gonzalez is in charge, the push will continue. He\u2019s been chairman since 2000 and has said he\u2019ll stay at the helm until the digital transformation is well underway. Banco Santander SA, the largest Spanish lender, has begun talking about its own digital ambitions. Chairman Ana Botin, 54, who took over from her father last year, said at her first annual earnings presentation in February that she wants to transform Santander into a technological player. More than half of CEOs at banks and capital-market firms see tech companies and other financial newcomers as a threat, almost double the portion last year, according to an annual survey published by PwC last month. In remarks last year, Gonzalez said the important decisions in digital banking were made seven years before, when BBVA began its transformation. He likened the emergence of new digital companies to the so-called Cambrian Explosion about 540 million years ago when life forms on earth multiplied and evolved rapidly. BBVA set up a digital banking division last year, headed by Carlos Torres Vila, to use technology to make the bank more efficient and increase its appeal to consumers. The bank has an innovation center in a former palace in Madrid where business strategists sit in open workspaces near film-set style models of shops and streets that simulate environments where customers are using the bank\u2019s services. Part of the bank\u2019s effort is to mine data gathered from customers to target them with products and services, without breaching client confidentiality. \u201cAny major bank will be able to buy technology, but if you are ahead on the learning curve like BBVA is you will know how to apply it,\u201d said Ricardo Wehrhahn, a Madrid-based managing partner at Intral Strategy Execution, a banking and business consultant.","timestamp":1425402000.0,"participant_ids":["BBVA:SM","GOOGL:US","FB:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-03\/banker-leading-digital-push-to-fend-off-google-facebook","subject":"Banker Leading Digital Push to Fend Off Google, Facebook"},{"body":"   almost tripled shipments to overtake Samsung Electronics Co. as China\u2019s top smartphone vendor last year, according to researcher IDC.

The smartphone maker sells at least three configurations of the Mi Power Bank on its website in China at prices ranging from about $7.90 to $21.

A purchase of the U.K. fashion footwear chain from\u00a0owner Silverfleet Capital would add to a list of overseas takeovers by South African companies, including this year\u2019s $1.2 billion acquisition of British fashion retailer New Look by Brait SE. No binding offer for the 150-store Office chain has been made, Cape Town-based Truworths said in a statement Monday. South African shopping chains have been struggling to grow sales at home as unemployment of more than 26 percent, power shortages and rising inflation stifles consumer spending. Those expanding abroad are benefiting from diversifying their sources of revenue beyond the rand, which has weakened 15 percent against the dollar this year. Last year, Woolworths Holdings Ltd. bought Australian chain David Jones Ltd. for about $2 billion. In January, The Foschini Group Ltd. agreed to buy U.K. clothing chain Phase Eight for $212 million.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the online retailer that went public with a record\u00a0$25 billion initial public offering a year ago, said last month it plans to repurchase as much as $4 billion of stock over two years. JD.com Inc. has authorized $1 billion for the purpose. Baidu Inc.\u2019s $1 billion share-buyback plan announced in July was its biggest ever. NetEase Inc.,\u00a0an online game operator, increased its planned repurchases five times to $500 million this month. The buyback programs come as the Bloomberg China-U.S. Equity Index trades near the lowest levels in 18 months. American depository receipts have tumbled in tandem with mainland-traded shares amid concern the magnitude of the slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy is worsening. The plunge has pushed the ADR gauge to trade near the lowest level since February 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive sign that they believe in their growth opportunities and their strategies,\u201d Brad Gastwirth, chief executive officer of ABR Investment Strategy, said by phone from San Francisco. \u201cMore companies may follow suit if shares continue to trade at discounts. But there is certainly selling pressure from U.S. institutions given the uncertainties in the region.\u201d Chinese stocks have pulled back amid concern the country\u2019s slowest economic expansion in 25 years will damp corporate earnings. Alibaba\u2019s shares have tumbled 50 percent since a high in November to trade below their public offering price of $68. JD.com has lost 32 percent since its high in June, while Baidu is down 41 percent this year. Companies on the Bloomberg ADR benchmark have authorized $7.6 billion in repurchases this year putting it on track for the highest annual total on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There are different motivations for why companies are boosting buybacks at this time. For some it\u2019s the appeal of cheaper valuations after the stock rout. JD.com is \u201cconstantly looking for ways to maximize returns for shareholders,\u201d and their recent repurchases \u201cadded flexibility\u201d for them to \u201cuse cash most effectively,\u201d Beijing-based spokesman Josh Gartner said in an e-mailed response to questions. Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s chairman and co-founder, isn\u2019t known for coddling investors. He has said several times that shareholders are a third priority after customers and employees. The company\u2019s share-purchase plan is primarily designed to offset dilution such as share-based compensation programs, according to an Aug. 12 statement. For others it may be part of a move to delist in the U.S. At least 30 Chinese companies, a record, have received offers to go private since the beginning of the year, aiming to return to China\u2019s local exchanges to get seek higher valuations. \u201cWe could take the share buyback moves as the management trying to get the company prepared to go back to China,\u201d said Daniel Wang, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Rongtong Global Investment Ltd., who manages $1 billion assets. Chinese companies have long complained that investors on Wall Street don\u2019t fully appreciate their business prospects, but simply invest based on the direction of economic data out of China. \u201cIt is very hard for us to explain to foreign investors that our business hasn\u2019t been really affected by the economic slowdown,\u201d Donghao Yang, chief financial officer of Vipshop Holdings Ltd., said in a Sept. 9 interview in New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried again and again. We can only hope one day investors will give us a fair valuation.\u201d The company\u2019s \u201ccore business\u201d of selling fashion goods at discounts online is \u201ccounter economic cycle,\u201d according to Yang, who said the company is making plans to buy back shares, which trade at 20 times forward earnings compared with an average for its global peers of 48. Baidu\u2019s Chairman Robin Li shared the same view. It is possible that he would delist the company from the U.S. entirely in favor of the Chinese market, he said in an interview on Sept 14. The planned buybacks may have limited impact on shares prices as company fundamentals are overshadowed by economic concerns, according to Henry Guo, an analyst at Summit Research Partners in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s actually not much left for the management to do in terms of boosting share prices,\u201d Guo said. \u201cIn this market, no matter whether you buy back shares or issue comments, it doesn\u2019t matter.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc.\u00a0could draw on more than $80 billion for mergers and acquisitions in 2016, according to analysts at BNP Paribas SA. That could enable them to easily surpass the record $30 billion spent this year according to Bloomberg data, as they buy their way into so-called online-to-offline Web services such as delivery services and physical retailing. With the market for such services potentially worth more than   in coming years, a shake-up is in the offing. The trio\u2019s deals should quicken a consolidation along the lines of the $15 billion merger of group-buying sites Meituan.com and Dianping.com and the creation of taxi-hailing giant Didi Kuaidi, both of which involved Alibaba and Tencent. The triumvirate known as BAT are seeking out new markets to move beyond core businesses of e-commerce or advertising. Alibaba alone would be able to spend as much as $38 billion on deals next year, analysts at BNP Paribas calculated based on available cash, its ability to take on debt and projected cash flows. By the same measures, Tencent could deploy $35 billion and Baidu about $15 billion, analysts led by Vey-Sern Ling wrote in a report Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely potential for many more deals to happen,\u201d said Michelle Ma, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cBAT are consolidating and they\u2019re going after smaller players which may struggle to survive on their own.\u201d Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu are rapidly emerging as go-to buyers, with venture financing becoming more   to obtain in a slowing economy. Many startups that had been burning cash through big incentives to draw customers are now facing pressure from their investors to cut their losses. Alibaba declined to comment on BNP\u2019s calculations, while Tencent didn\u2019t respond to an e-mailed request for comment. Baidu doesn\u2019t earmark a budget for deals, which can be done with cash or equity or both, Baidu investor relations official Sharon Ng said in an e-mail. \u201cWe need to see strong strategic rationale,\u2019 she said. China\u2019s burgeoning market for \u201cO2O\u201d -- online services delivered or fulfilled in the physical world -- is crammed with hundreds of small players providing everything from massages and food delivery to handyman services. In the rush to grow their user base, most, including Alibaba- and Tencent-backed operators, eschew profits and resort to heavy subsidies and marketing. The overall market could be worth 10 trillion yuan ($1.6 trillion) eventually, HSBC analysts led by Chi Tsang wrote in a November report. Tencent, the maker of the WeChat and QQ messaging apps, is ahead in deals this year, taking part in 37 completed or pending acquisitions totaling $16.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Other major investors would be less likely to take a risk with Russia\u2019s third-biggest mobile-phone company as the country struggles with a recession, said analysts at Fondsfinans and\u00a0Otkritie Capital. Russian tycoon Fridman\u2019s investment firm is already the main owner of VimpelCom and has battled with Telenor for influence over the carrier. The scarcity of potential buyers may limit the proceeds the Nordic region\u2019s biggest phone company can expect to receive for its 33 percent stake, which is valued at about 20 billion kroner ($2.4 billion). Yet Telenor investors welcomed the news as the company is divesting an asset that it couldn\u2019t fully control while reducing its exposure to Russia and Ukraine as well as a bribery probe VimpelCom is facing over its Uzbekistan operations. \u201cEverybody wants them to sell the stake so that\u2019s neutral -- the problem is that there is technically only one buyer,\u201d said Daniel Johansson, an analyst at Fondsfinans in Oslo. \u201cThere\u2019s zero chance that it will be someone else completely unknown, like a Western investor.\u201d Telenor is free to sell the stake to anyone as a stockholder agreement with Fridman\u2019s investment firm is no longer valid, said Glenn Mandelid, a spokesman for the Norwegian company.

Fridman\u2019s L1 Technology, previously known as Altimo, is the largest shareholder in VimpelCom with about an   voting stake. L1 Managing Partner Alexey Reznikovich is the chairman of VimpelCom\u2019s board. What may limit other investors\u2019 interest is the rocky history that Telenor had with VimpelCom\u2019s Russian co-owners, said Alexander Vengranovich, an analyst at Otkritie in Moscow. Fridman and Telenor fought for influence over the company, and Russia\u2019s anti-monopoly regulator took legal action in 2012 to stop Telenor from gaining control of the carrier, which owns assets deemed \u201cstrategic\u201d by the Russian government. Fridman \u201cseems the most obvious buyer for Telenor\u2019s stake,\" Vengranovich said. Selling the shares in the market is less likely as it would raise less money than a sale to a strategic investor, he said. A sale would end Telenor\u2019s involvement with a company being investigated as part of a probe into Gulnara Karimova, daughter of Uzbekistan\u2019s president.

Customers of UnionPay, China\u2019s largest payment and clearing network, will be able to add their bank cards to iPhones, iPads and the Apple Watch for purchases through Apple Pay, the companies said in a statement. Users of Samsung Galaxy and Note devices will have similar options. While the deals allow the two biggest smartphone makers to take their nascent payments systems to the world\u2019s largest market with the backing of state-backed UnionPay, they will face entrenched competition. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Tenpay have already built large customer bases for payments on their e-commerce and other business platforms. \u201cAlipay remains the industry\u2019s dominant player, which Apple Pay would find difficult to surpass in the near future,\u201d Di Jin, an analyst at Forrester Research, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe partnership between Apple and UnionPay is a strategy of compromise that is unlikely to help Apple gain more users from their competition, despite UnionPay\u2019s existing mobile payment alliances with banks and Internet companies.\" Still, for foreign companies such as Apple and Samsung, China offers an opportunity to profit from a\u00a0market where\u00a0mobile-payment transactions jumped 134 percent to 22.6 trillion yuan ($3.5 trillion) last year,   data show. Apple and Samsung use different technology for their services. Apple Pay utilizes near-field communication,\u00a0which enables users to pay for purchases by tapping their phone or watch with stored bank-card information on a device at cash registers. UnionPay has more than 5 million point-of-sale machines that are NFC-enabled in China. While Samsung\u2019s service also uses NFC, it offers traditional magnetic stripe reading technology, as well. Apple Pay charges 0.15 percent of the value of each purchase made through its system, out of the 2 percent fee paid by merchants in U.S., Caixin magazine reported in February. Such a rate would be too expensive in China, given that the total fee paid by some merchants is only 0.38 percent, Caixin said. Alibaba\u2019s Alipay affiliate controlled 83 percent of China\u2019s third-party mobile payment market\u00a0in 2014, while Tenpay held 10 percent, according to market-research firm  . Alipay allows its\u00a0more than 400 million real-name registered users to make purchases from desktop computers, tablets and smartphones at more than 130,000 bricks-and-mortar merchants, according to its  .

The stock was in the doldrums and the data-security company was losing out on business to bigger rivals such as International Business Machines Corp. Now, with a new chief executive officer, Anthony Bettencourt, who took over last August, and a revamped sales and marketing team, Imperva has put the tech giant on notice -- it wants those deals back. \u201cI won\u2019t get them all back but I do want them all back,\u201d Bettencourt said in a June 10 phone interview. \u201cFrom a technology base, we are so far superior.\u201d Shares of Imperva, which specializes in firewalls for Web applications and monitoring access to databases, have more than doubled since Bettencourt came on board. The rise has been driven in part by a stream of high-profile data breaches that are spurring companies to invest in more sophisticated protection from cyberattacks. Bettencourt, who was brought in to reorganize Imperva\u2019s sales teams after revenue fell short of expectations last year, said he\u2019s going after contracts that total as much as $200 million. Imperva lost 203 contracts to IBM from 2010 through the first quarter of 2015, Bettencourt said. In the last 18 months, it beat out IBM on 39 deals. In a May 7 conference call with analysts, Bettencourt said IBM and other rivals were \u201cworld-class infrastructure companies\u201d that have a \u201cweekend hobby called security.\u201d Given recent hacking incidents and their costs, \u201cno one wants a hobbyist,\u201d he said. Tim Breuer, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM, declined to comment on competition with Imperva. Bettencourt, who replaced founder and Israeli serial entrepreneur Shlomo Kramer, is trying to steal business from IBM\u2019s Guardium unit, which helps companies protect databases. Breuer cited a   by research firm Gartner Inc. that showed IBM\u2019s overall security-software business grew 17 percent in 2014 to $1.5 billion in revenue, the fastest pace among the largest software-security vendors. IBM ranks third worldwide in market share behind Symantec Corp. and Intel Corp., with 6.9 percent of the market, according to Gartner. \u201cWe continue to gain share and outpace our competition,\u201d Breuer wrote in an e-mailed response to questions. Imperva\u2019s stock has climbed 26 percent this year, approaching the record high of $65.53 in March 2014. The shares fell 2.2 percent to $62.45 at 9:55 a.m. in New York. First-quarter revenue rose 42 percent to $45 million, and annual revenue is forecast to grow 26 percent to $206 million, according to the average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Like other upstart cybersecurity companies such as Palo Alto Networks Inc. and FireEye Inc., Imperva is broadening its range of products in order to go after bigger contracts, said Andrew Nowinski, an analyst with Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, who recommends buying Imperva shares. The Redwood Shores, California-based company made three acquisitions in 2014, including one to protect against denial-of-service attacks like the one that targeted  , and another company that monitors the use of cloud applications to prevent the theft of employee data. \u201cIf you have a platform approach, you can start bundling more and more products together, which is what Imperva\u2019s doing and what the legacy vendors are doing,\u201d Nowinski said. The strategy means Imperva will have \u201ca much better chance of winning large deals.\u201d Imperva\u2019s growth rates relative to the industry average suggest it\u2019s winning business from competitors, but overtaking incumbents like IBM will be an uphill battle, said Rob Owens, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Oregon. Imperva\u2019s main challenge is \u201cfighting the incumbency of the larger vendor, they have more feet on the street, they\u2019re larger companies,\u201d Owens said by phone. Bettencourt said Imperva has \u201ca lot of wood to chop\u201d to reach its growth goals. The company has forecast as much as 26 percent sales growth this year, but Bettencourt said he\u2019s trying for 30 percent. He plans to announce new areas of expansion in the third or fourth quarter, and raised about $130 million in a share sale in March to fund more acquisitions, particularly startups that would enhance the technology of existing products. If Bettencourt succeeds, it will make the company a more attractive target to the mature software companies he\u2019s trying to upend, said Matthew Hedberg, an analyst with Royal Bank of Canada in Minneapolis. \u201cSecurity is a consolidating industry,\u201d Hedberg said, and Imperva is \u201ca unique asset.\u201d","timestamp":1434218401.0,"participant_ids":["IBM:US","IMPV:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-13\/trash-talking-rival-ceo-vows-to-beat-ibm-on-cybersecurity-deals","subject":"Trash-Talking Rival CEO Vows to Beat IBM on Cybersecurity Deals"},{"body":" Insider traders have long shelled out millions in bribes, manipulated friendships and even traded sex for market tips. Now, they\u2019ve found a new way to get the data they need: employing computer hackers. \u201cWith the ubiquity of hackers now, you can find people online who\u2019ll do what you want for a pizza,\u201d said Slade Griffin, founder of Knoxville, Tennessee-based Cyphoss Security LLC. \u201cYou combine the financial brilliance of someone that\u2019s criminally minded with the ease of access to hackers and hacking tools, why wouldn\u2019t you do it?\u201d Two federal indictments unsealed Tuesday alleging a   between traders and hackers confirm a long-held fear in industries from banking to electricity that data stolen from servers will be used to manipulate markets or trade on non-public information. Specialists say there\u2019s evidence of growing collusion between digital thieves and market profiteers that goes far beyond what the handful of prosecutions so far suggests. A similar scam was identified by cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. last year, one that profited from the volatility of health-care company stocks. Enforcement agencies only began intensively investigating the scam several months after the company had detailed in a public report how hackers had siphoned off sensitive e-mails of corporate officers and their advisers, according to a person familiar with the probe. There have been no arrests in the FireEye case. The ease of stealing insider details from a potentially endless supply of hacking targets presents an enormous challenge to the ideal of a level playing field for the market. That may be one reason why Securities and Exchange Commission officials said the current case, in which hackers stole   packed with financial data from public relations companies that distribute them, shows they\u2019re up to the task. That\u2019s far from clear, according to former officials, who note how hard it has been for everyone from Hollywood stars to the Department of Defense to protect even their most intimate secrets from hackers. The use of hacking by insider traders opens up opportunities for fraudsters who don\u2019t have a deep network of Wall Street relationships from which to skim information. Such networks were central to the U.S. government\u2019s 2011 prosecution of Galleon Group hedge-fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and several co-defendants, in what was billed as a landmark case for its aggressive use of wiretaps and witness-flipping. The use of hacking may ultimately cause a reevaluation of how much of a lasting effect there will be from the Galleon case, which cost millions of dollars to prosecute and was a top priority for Preet Bharara, the Manhattan U.S. attorney. Rather than significantly deterring insider trading, that case may simply have accelerated the move to cyberspace, where the personal relationships that tripped up defendants in the physical world no longer exist, specialists say. \u201cWe knew this was coming,\u201d said Edward Stroz, a former FBI agent who\u2019s now executive chairman of Stroz Friedberg, which advises firms on hacking schemes. \u201cIn the classic examples, the currency of insider trading was a personal relationship. All of a sudden you have this possibility that never existed before where proxy insiders can get information from an ocean away.\u201d One thing that was clear from the Galleon prosecution was that maintaining a pipeline of valuable insider information was expensive and complex. Some of the tipsters were paid more than $1 million for tradeable information. Others appeared to offer it freely because of friendships groomed over years. One defendant, Danielle Chiesi, pleaded guilty to conspiracy before the trial and went to prison in October 2011. In her  , she admitted she solicited inside tips from technology industry executives. Among them was Robert Moffat, a former executive with International Business Machines Corp. with whom she had an intimate relationship, he said in his guilty plea. Moffat got a six-month sentence. Compare that with operations of the hackers uncovered last year by FireEye, a group the company dubbed Fin4. Although clearly sophisticated, their operation required less time and money for a potentially richer archive of knowledge. Along with the theft of corporate e-mails, they   law firms and public relations companies that would be part of the information chain for important announcements like mergers or the results of drug studies, according to FireEye. In one example dealing with a potential acquisition -- an event that can create huge swings in a company\u2019s stock price -- the hackers simultaneously targeted five different organizations involved in the talks, accessing details months before they became public, according to a report released by FireEye in December. The indictments that were unsealed on Tuesday, as well as a lengthy SEC complaint, allege another  . For as long as five years, hackers based in Ukraine lifted press releases from the computers of PR Newswire Association LLC and two competitors, then uploaded them into a system that could be accessed by traders in the U.S., Cyprus, Russia and France. The hackers worked on tight deadlines, sometimes as little as a half-hour. In the case of one announcement that showed Caterpillar Inc.\u2019s profit rose 36 percent, the traders allegedly bought more than $8.3 million of the company\u2019s shares and options, anticipating a pop in price the following day on the news. The bet worked, netting the defendants about $1 million, according to prosecutors. PR Newswire and the two competitors said they\u2019re cooperating with authorities. The scheme connected an odd association of individuals that bears little resemblance to the financial high-flyers who conspired with Rajaratnam. They include Arkadiy and Igor Dubovoy, a father and son team living in the U.S. state of Georgia, and another relative, Pavel Dubovoy, believed to live in Ukraine. None have obvious expertise in global financial markets. It was unclear whether Arkadiy and Igor Dubovoy retained lawyers. Attorneys for other defendants didn\u2019t return phone calls. The SEC traced a series of suspicious trades to the alleged conspirators, which may have been the result of running the scheme over a number of years, according to a person familiar with the case. John Reed Stark, the SEC\u2019s former head of Internet enforcement, said that\u2019s one of the risks of this kind of activity. While hacking is often hard to detect, consistently trading on insider information leaves a different kind of trail that the agency has gotten good at spotting. While that may help the SEC deal with this new mode of insider trading, there\u2019s plenty of headwind, including statutes and case law that don\u2019t contemplate hacking as an efficient means to gather vast quantities of illicit market intelligence, Stark said. He pointed to a recent federal court decision that held hackers must use deceptive methods of entering a computer network for the SEC to have jurisdiction. That would entail methods like sending malware-loaded e-mails but might not include exploiting an existing security flaw in a company\u2019s computer system. \u201cTo the average person, hacking into a computer in order to get information to trade on would be illegal,\u201d Stark said. \u201cBut depending on how it\u2019s done, it might be theft but not necessarily securities fraud.\u201d","timestamp":1439359200.0,"participant_ids":["FEYE:US","FEYE:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-12\/market-cheating-moves-from-trading-sex-to-hacking-to-gain-edge","subject":"Market Cheats Move From Trading Sex to Hacking to Gain Edge"},{"body":" Chinese social networking site YY Inc. and online retailer E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. received buyout offers from their managers after U.S.-listed Chinese shares tumbled along with those at home.

The combination of Meituan.com, part-owned by Alibaba, with Tencent-backed Dianping.com\u00a0may be announced as soon as Thursday, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Meituan\u2019s shareholders will own about 60 percent of the combined company, the people said. China\u2019s largest Internet companies are investing heavily in the $1.6 trillion online-to-offline services market, betting that the use of smartphones and tablets to book everything from hotel rooms to car rides will become mainstream. Chinese users of location-based services could rise 29 percent to 400 million by 2017, according to Internet consultancy IResearch. A Meituan-Dianping combination would pose a threat to Baidu Inc., which is investing $3.2 billion over three years in\u00a0Nuomi, its own local services venture. Baidu Chief Executive Officer Robin Li is trying to transform the search company into a provider of on-demand services. \u201cThe two companies merging would allow them to have absolute dominance of the group-buying market, and require less cash burn,\u201d said Wang Weidong, an analyst at Internet consultancy IResearch in Beijing. \u201cThey will be putting a lot of pressure on competitors.\u201d Often compared with Groupon Inc., five-year-old Meituan is the leading player in a group-buying market worth 77 billion yuan ($12.1 billion) in the first half. It accounted for 51.9 percent of Chinese group buying transactions in the first six months, according to a report by researcher Analysys International. Dianping accounted for 29.5 percent, followed by Baidu\u2019s Nuomi with 13.6 percent. Chief Executive Officer Wang Xing last year said Meituan as on track to more than triple revenue to about $300 million in 2014. Tencent owns about 20 percent of prospective merger partner Dianping.com, co-founder Edward Long said in an interview last year. Founded in 2003, his company offers search, consumer-generated reviews and deals. An Alibaba-Tencent tie-up in local services would mirror the creation of Didi Kuaidi this year via a merger of two competing taxi-hailing apps they separately backed. That marriage was intended to curtail an aggressive expansion by Uber Technologies Inc. and marked a rare cooperation between companies that still compete head-to-head in entertainment, e-commerce, even banking. Shares in Tencent gained 1.7 percent to HK$142 in Hong Kong. Spokesmen for Alibaba and Dianping declined to comment, while a representative for Meituan said the company couldn\u2019t immediately comment. A spokeswoman for Tencent didn\u2019t respond to a mobile-phone text message and e-mail seeking comment during a public holiday in China. There have been $58.4 billion of Internet deals involving Chinese companies this year, already almost double the amount for 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Meituan recently completed a funding round that valued the company at about $10.5 billion, after originally seeking a valuation of as much as $15 billion, one of the people said. Local services have in the past year grown to become a top priority for Alibaba and Tencent. Alibaba has pledged to continue investing in initiatives like Koubei, its joint venture with Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group Co. Tencent took part in an August funding round for\u00a0Ele.me that valued the biggest player in meal deliveries\u00a0at about $3 billion, according to Chinese business magazine Caijing.

Alibaba shares rose 3.7 percent in U.S. trading to $66.28 at the close in New York, leaving them down 36 percent this year. Their alliance poses a threat to Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li, the third giant of China\u2019s Internet who has also\u00a0targeted what\u2019s known as the O2O market. Baidu, the leading search-engine in China, is investing $3.2 billion over three years in its own provider of local services. Baidu\u2019s Nuomi is the third-largest player in group buying with 13.6 percent of the market, according to Analysys. \"The market is still at an early, fast-growth stage, which means it\u2019s too early in the game to decide who the ultimate winner\u2019s going to be,\" said Kaiser Kuo, a spokesman for Baidu. \"Local is still Baidu\u2019s turf to win, and we are very, very committed.\" The deal comes as venture financing is becoming more difficult to obtain in China amid the slowing economy and wobbly stock market. Many Web startups that had been burning cash through big incentives to draw customers are facing pressure to cut their losses. \"Winter is coming for the capital market,\" said Jeff Hao, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Merchants Securities Holdings. \"It\u2019s getting harder to find people who are willing to invest.\" Jack Ma, 51, and\u00a0Ma \"Pony\" Huateng, 43, have been rivals almost since the Internet began to take off in China. Jack started Alibaba from his Hangzhou apartment in 1999 with $60,000 and built it into the leading e-commerce player in the country. Pony created the instant messaging service QQ for Tencent in Shenzhen\u00a0in 1999 and now has user base of more than 1 billion for his messaging, games and other services. The two companies have traded positions as the most valuable Internet company in China, with Tencent currently ahead. Jack has a higher personal net worth at $26.7 billion, compared with Pony\u2019s\u00a0$17.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The two men, who are not related, have competed for acquisitions and driven the value of Internet deals involving Chinese companies to $58.4 billion this year, already almost double the amount for 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the current deal, Meituan\u2019s shareholders will own about 60 percent of the combined company, which will be valued at about $15 billion, the people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. An Alibaba-Tencent tie-up in local services would mirror the creation of Didi Kuaidi this year via a merger of competing taxi-hailing apps they separately backed. That marriage was intended to curtail an aggressive expansion by Uber and marked a rare cooperation between companies that still compete head-to-head in entertainment, e-commerce and finance. As fundraising becomes more difficult in China, the current merger could provide advantages for both sides. It would let the Alibaba and Tencent-backed startups avoid competition with their closest rival, potentially saving money on subsidies and allowing them to collaborate on future efforts. \u201cThe two companies merging would allow them to have absolute dominance of the group-buying market, and require less cash burn,\u201d said Wang Weidong, an analyst at Internet consultancy IResearch in Beijing. \u201cThey will be putting a lot of pressure on competitors.\u201d","timestamp":1444204995.0,"participant_ids":["BABA:US","700:HK","BIDU:US","0227049Z:CH"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-07\/besties-why-alibaba-tencent-are-teaming-up-in-15-billion-deal","subject":"Besties?

Under their agreement, Wang Xing, chief executive officer of Alibaba-backed Meituan, and his counterpart at Tencent-backed Dianping Zhang Tao will run the new company as co-chairmen and co-CEOs.

Symantec, which has been shopping the unit for several months, is still negotiating the terms of a possible transaction, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. No agreement has been reached and talks could still falter. Veritas, which Symantec bought in 2005 for more than $13 billion, generates cash flow but has low revenue growth. Shaping it up would require firing employees and shutting down product lines, a person familiar with the situation   in April. The potential strategic buyers of Veritas dropped out of the process as it became clearer that a private-equity buyer could better afford Symantec\u2019s price while stomaching the months or years of work needed to improve the company\u2019s results, a person with knowledge of the process said. \u201cWe would view a $7.5 billion price tag as a good price,\u201d Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co., said in a note to clients. \u201cWe would welcome a sale versus a split despite negative tax implications, as it would be a major liquidity event for Symantec and add more dry powder to help bulk up its next-generation cyber security.\u201d Symantec shares rose as much as 1.6 percent in New York.

Data-storage in general is a slow-growth business and Symantec\u2019s storage segment reflected those pressures. Revenue in that business for the latest fiscal year, which ended April 3, was up 2 percent to $2.56 billion, and operating income was down 15 percent to $486 million. Symantec had planned on spinning out the unit as a separately traded company later this year if it couldn\u2019t find a buyer. In October, Symantec said it would split into two divisions, separating its storage and security businesses.

Equity for the deal will primarily come from Carlyle\u2019s U.S. buyout fund and GIC, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Washington-based Carlyle said in a statement Tuesday. The transaction is expected to be completed at year-end. Carlyle and Mountain View, California-based Symantec negotiated terms for months, and the deal is the first major buyout to be done from the private equity firm\u2019s newly reopened Silicon Valley office. In a year when private equity dealmakers including Carlyle\u2019s Bill Conway have lamented high prices for companies, the transaction is the biggest U.S. leveraged buyout announced in 2015, surpassing the $5.3 billion   of software company Informatica Corp. by Permira and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bill Coleman, the founder of software company BEA Systems Inc., will become Veritas\u2019s chief executive officer, the companies said. Bill Krause, a Carlyle operating executive who previously was president and CEO of 3Com, will be chairman. The Veritas sale will provide cash for Symantec, which has seen its dominance of the cyber-security business eroded as hackers have found ways to thwart its key security product, antivirus software. Symantec needs the cash to fund acquisitions and build costly security services such as incident response, Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. in New York, said in an interview. \u201cThere have been some glimmers of positive news about product refreshes and some of what they\u2019ve done around cost cutting, but the growth issues they have here are massive,\u201d said Ives, who rates the stock market perform. \u201cThey\u2019ve been really on the wrong side of spending in terms of cyber-security.\u201d For the quarter ended in June, Symantec said sales fell 14 percent to $1.5 billion, missing the $1.53 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Adjusted profit of 40 cents a share compared with the 43-cent average expectation. Symantec fell 6.9 percent, the most since March 2014, to $21.34 at the close of trading in New York, extending its decline this year to 17 percent. A sale of Veritas, bought in 2005 for more than $13 billion, is symbolic of Symantec\u2019s refocusing on the security market as it tries to lessen its dependence on antivirus. As part of the effort, Symantec earlier this year said it was hiring 65 engineers and data scientists from Boeing Co.\u2019s Narus security division, which makes network-monitoring technologies used by the U.S. government. Carlyle, founded in 1987 by Conway, Dan D\u2019Aniello and David Rubenstein, has snapped up corporate orphans since it started buying defense companies in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall. So-called carve-outs were once the bread-and-butter of the leveraged buyout business as practitioners such as Carlyle, Blackstone Group LP and Clayton Dubilier & Rice persuaded boards of directors to sell a struggling unit or a business that didn\u2019t fit into a corporation\u2019s strategic direction. \u201cOur significant experience investing in software businesses, as well as our extensive experience with carve-out transactions, positions us well,\u201d said Cam Dyer, a managing director in Carlyle\u2019s telecommunications, media and technology group.

That\u2019s true for the stock market at least, even if a transformation of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy is still years away. Technology firms\u2019 weighting in MSCI Inc.\u2019s benchmark Chinese equity gauge will almost double to 26 percent by May, after a Nov. 12 review when overseas-listed firms from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Baidu Inc. become eligible for inclusion, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The change will affect investors with at least $400 billion of Chinese stock holdings and give the country a higher concentration of software companies than any other MSCI index worldwide. The stock gauge\u2019s evolution is a sped-up version of what President Xi Jinping\u2019s government is trying to do for China\u2019s economy: boost the role of privately-owned technology and service businesses while downsizing state-run industrial and financial giants. Investors have already made clear which group they prefer, with U.S.-listed Chinese technology stocks valued at levels almost four times higher than the MSCI China gauge. \u201cIt\u2019s a better and fairer representation of the China universe, which you don\u2019t really see and didn\u2019t really get in the past,\u201d said Frank Tian, a Hong Kong-based investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which oversees $483 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a step in the right direction.\u201d The weighting of financial companies in the MSCI China gauge will fall to 34 percent from 41 percent, with energy, industrials and utilities also declining, Goldman Sachs said in a Oct. 23 report. The changes may trigger $78 billion of net buying, the New York-based bank estimated. About $1.6 trillion tracks the MSCI Emerging Market Index, and China makes up about 25 percent of those positions, according to Chia Chin-ping, a managing director at the index compiler. MSCI   in January that companies listed outside their home market should be included in national benchmark equity gauges. The additions are being phased in as part of the index compiler\u2019s six-monthly reviews in November and in May. As many as 14 companies might be added to the MSCI China index, according to a simulation of the change, which also affects companies from Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Israel. While China\u2019s government doesn\u2019t publish a breakdown of the technology sector\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product, official data show the growing importance of service industries, which make up more than half the economy and   at a 8.4 percent pace in the first nine months of 2015. That compares with 6 percent growth in the industrial and construction sectors. The new MSCI China measure will be skewed toward companies that are shielded from the nation\u2019s slowing economy, according to Adrian Mowat, the chief Asian and emerging-market equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about certain parts of the Chinese economy like steel and cement,\u201d Mowat said. \u201cBut for the stock market, it\u2019s not an issue because they\u2019re a tiny percentage of the benchmark. What matters is what\u2019s happening with e-commerce, online gaming, etc. That\u2019s the driver of the index.\u201d Earnings at financial companies in the CSI 300 Index are projected to climb 16 percent in the next 12 months, compared with 28 percent for technology shares, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the first of the nation\u2019s big lenders to report third-quarter earnings, said profit increased just 1 percent from a year earlier. Alibaba\u2019s net income, excluding one-time items, climbed about 36 percent over the same period as sales topped analysts\u2019 estimates. Baidu\u2019s third-quarter revenue jumped 36 percent. For all the optimism toward Chinese technology companies, Alibaba and Baidu, the two biggest projected additions to the MSCI gauge, have been losing bets in 2015 on concern that slower economic growth will hurt sales. Alibaba has also been dragged down by government scrutiny of counterfeits in its online marketplace, with the American depositary receipts slumping 21 percent this year. Chinese tech shares in the U.S., which trade at a weighted average of 37 times reported earnings, are both more expensive and more volatile than the MSCI China gauge. \u201cThose are growth stocks, so definitely by nature the high growth is high volatility,\u201d said Paul Chan, the Hong Kong-based chief investment officer for Asia excluding Japan at Invesco Ltd., which oversees $776 billion globally. \u201cBut hopefully they will increase return.\u201d Most of the other potential new entrants have done better than Alibaba and Baidu, with JD.Com Inc. jumping 19 percent this year and NetEase Inc. surging 43 percent. A Bloomberg gauge of U.S.-listed Chinese companies is up 9.1 percent in 2015, compared with a 5.7 percent drop in the MSCI China index.

By achieving scale, \u201cwaiting times are shortened by a little, fares become cheaper, and because more drivers on the platform don\u2019t require subsidies, you create a virtuous circle of increased orders, customer retention.\u201d Liu was explaining why the company was \u201cburning cash\u201d to chase operational scale and did not say whether the company will eventually end driver subsidies. The contents of the transcript were confirmed by Didi Kuaidi, which said it still provides subsidies to commuters and drivers and that incentive levels fluctuate. Didi Kuaidi, formed from a merger of two competing Chinese taxi-hailing apps in February, has competed with Uber in giving out incentives to attract drivers and   to win over commuters. The subsidies, which can reach multiple times the actual fare, has also created a   aimed at scamming the companies of the payouts. \u201cThis kind of subsidy activity has got to stop because nobody can afford to lose money forever,\u201d Robin Li, Baidu Inc. chairman, said in an interview at the company\u2019s annual conference in Beijing. \u201cThis vertical, transportation, is not different from any other vertical - dining, or laundry services,\u201d he said, referring to businesses using online platforms to connect to real-life services. \u201cAt this time those O2O services are losing money, but I think one day it will stop.\u201d Baidu invested in Uber China and integrated the ride-booking company\u2019s hailing service into its mapping function to provide better user experiences, Li said. Drivers for Didi Kuaidi contacted by Bloomberg say the company has reduced the subsidies to drivers. \u201cThe subsidies I get from Didi are about half of the peak in the past,\u201d said Tom Teng, who has been driving part-time for Didi for about six months. \u201cIt is pretty easy to get orders nowadays, there are so many of them.\u201d Both companies have been raising funds from investors to pay for their expansion plans. Didi Kuaidi is close to   about $3 billion from investors, more than it had originally planned, according to people familiar with the matter. The latest round of financing values the company at $16.5 billion, according to one of the people, who asked not to be named because the details are private. On Tuesday, Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick said at the Baidu World conference in Beijing that the company is now handling 1 million rides a day in China and created 100,000 jobs. Its market share has climbed to 30 percent to 35 percent from 1 percent at the start of the year, and Uber plans to add about 100 more cities to the 20 that it currently operates in, Kalanick said. Uber China has raised $1.2 billion and will continue its fundraising as more investors are interested, according to Huang Xue, a Beijing-based spokeswoman.

Now he wants to help them get laundry delivered, book a doctor\u2019s appointment or hire a chef to cook in their homes. The future, as Li sees it, is not in search but in services, connecting people through the Web to thousands of entrepreneurs and businesses in the real world. He\u2019s betting billions of dollars on the untested vision, risking revolt among investors as he sacrifices profit today for future growth. The significance of the effort was made clear last week when Li took the stage at Baidu\u2019s annual conference in Beijing. Internet search, which generates virtually all company profit, barely rated a mention. Instead, the Baidu founder declared his top priority is the online-to-offline push, known in geek-speak as O2O. \u201cWe are actually transforming the company from connecting people with information to connecting people with services,\u201d said Li, 46, in an hour-long interview after the presentation. To Li, the math is simple. While search advertising is big, the services and retail market is much bigger. The initiative will \u201cdefinitely\u201d eclipse search revenue over time, he said. In cities like Beijing, the vision is already taking shape. Click an application on your smartphone and someone will stop by your home to wash and walk your dog. A few more taps and someone will deliver groceries or medicine. One fashionable new service is the chef app, where you pick a specialist in home style Chinese or spicy Sichuanese. They\u2019ll even bring the ingredients and wash the dishes when you\u2019re done. Xie Yufeng, a 30-year-old who works at an entertainment company, likes the convenience of ordering meals on Baidu. \u201cI can check the location of the delivery man in the online map, then estimate when he will arrive,\u201d she said. Investors are skeptical all this will pay off. Baidu\u2019s American depositary receipts fell 1.9 percent to $141.27 in New York on Monday, widening this year\u2019s loss to 38 percent. Li has poured money into the initiative and driven operating margins down to 21 percent in the second quarter from 52 percent three years earlier. The drop has been compounded by broader weakness in the Chinese economy. \u201cBaidu\u2019s weak outlook couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time,\u201d said Brendan Ahern, managing director of Krane Fund Advisors LLC whose KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF has shares in Baidu and competitor Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \u201cChina sentiment among U.S. investors is poor.\u201d Li, Baidu\u2019s chief executive officer, says many U.S. investors just don\u2019t appreciate the changes in China, where O2O services are taking off fast because of new smartphone technology, cheap labor and terrible traffic. He\u2019s concerned Baidu, which trades on Nasdaq, is being penalized because shareholders don\u2019t see the opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of difficult for a typical U.S. public market investor to really understand why Baidu is losing so much money on those unproven businesses,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe have a better understanding of this market. We think this kind of investment will pay off. So there\u2019s a little bit of education needed.\u201d Li has plenty of competition in China. Dozens of startups swarm into each niche as it takes off, and Baidu is playing catchup in several. Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd., the other two giants of China\u2019s Internet, also are investing aggressively. Still, Li is determined to grab the lead in what he calls \u201chigh-frequency\u201d services like food delivery, movie tickets and car rides. Though profits are minimal or nonexistent now, he argues these services will train consumers for more profitable activities in the future. \u201cWe need to win the high-frequency war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for Baidu to grab the opportunity.\u201d To get there, Baidu is tapping its $12 billion in cash and capitalizing on its dominant share of search users in China. It also has a 20,000-strong sales force and a team of scientists in Beijing and Silicon Valley developing voice, image, deep learning and high-performance computing technologies. At the Baidu World conference last week, Li showed off the latest product from this search-meets-science development, a voice-prompted digital assistant called Duer. Akin to Apple Inc.\u2019s Siri, Duer goes a step further, letting users start by searching movie information and finish by booking theater seats. Another plank in Baidu\u2019s strategy is its equity stake in Uber Technologies Inc. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was the second speaker on stage at Baidu World after Li and explained the China expansion of the ride-hailing service. From 20 cities now, Uber plans to add another 100 during the next year, he told the crowd. Baidu has made more than a dozen such investments in the past two years, including the $169 million stake in a startup called Nuomi Holdings Inc. That\u2019s become the platform for on-site services such as dining, movie tickets and karaoke. Baidu pledged 20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) of investments in Nuomi over three years. Almost 60 percent of movie tickets in China are sold online, more than the U.S. Trouble is, the business bleeds cash for Baidu and everyone else. \u201cMovies will always lose money,\u201d Zeng Liang, general manager of Nuomi, said in an interview. Still, \u201cthis is a very good category for building up your users\u2019 loyalty.\u201d Nuomi is trying to get beyond bargain hunters to cultivate frequent users. Instead of just offering discounts, Nuomi is building a system that will reward loyalty with such member benefits as priority seating, Zeng said. A separate platform called Baidu Takeout operates a fleet of contracted electric-bike riders delivering anything from sushi and spaghetti to milk or tea. Li claims Baidu has an edge in these services because its expertise in data, analytics and maps allows it to optimize routing and logistics. Tencent didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Its shares were little changed in Hong Kong trading Monday. Alibaba is approaching the O2O market with the advantages it holds as China\u2019s dominant e-commerce company, with more than 350 million active buyers and 10 million sellers on its sites. It also set up a venture called Koubei this year to focus on local services in China, initially focusing on food and beverages. \u201cAlibaba intends to build upon our strength in mobile to develop a broad spectrum of consumer offerings, such as location-based services, offline commerce and entertainment,\u201d the Hangzhou-based company said in an e-mail. It\u2019s easy to see where the money is going in the O2O market, but harder to see where profits will come from. In addition to Alibaba\u2019s investments, Tencent has taken minority stakes in startups Dianping.com and Ele.me. Normally intense rivals, Alibaba and Tencent teamed up to merge their car-hailing apps this year into Didi Kuaidi to hold off Uber. Didi\u2019s president this month vowed to   to keep its dominant position in the market. \u201cAlthough Baidu has gained significant market share in China\u2019s O2O market, especially in food delivery, converting that to actual revenue is difficult for all players because of stiff competition and little differentiation,\u201d said Michelle Ma, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Li has the patience to make investments now and wait for the payoff. He\u2019s not sure his investors do. He has said publicly he would like to list Baidu shares in China, in addition to those traded on Nasdaq. Now, he says it\u2019s possible he would delist from the U.S. entirely in favor of his home market. \u201cIf one day I find that the U.S. market has no hope of recognizing our value, and the domestic market truly understands our business, I may do that,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, we need to be patient and give our U.S. investors some time. I hope they will be able to appreciate us more.\u201d","timestamp":1442170800.0,"participant_ids":["BIDU:US","BABA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-13\/baidu-s-li-says-investors-don-t-get-china-s-coming-internet-boom","subject":"Baidu\u2019s Li Says Investors Don\u2019t Get China\u2019s Coming Internet Boom"},{"body":" Facebook Inc. this spring commissioned a San Francisco company called SalesBrain to gauge how consumers responded to ads viewed on a smartphone versus a TV screen. Neural researchers used various sensors to measure perspiration, heart rate, eye movement, and brain activity of the 70 participants. Their conclusion: People get more out of information on a mobile phone than a TV, and watching television forces the brain to work harder to combat distractions. \u201cOur physical closeness to the mobile screen has shifted our perception of the size of the device,\u201d says Helen Crossley, the head of audience insights for  , the company\u2019s internal market research unit. \u201cIt is drawing us in to be more attentive and feel more positive about the content.\u201d A host of new companies founded or staffed by brain researchers have some advice for advertisers: Read your customers\u2019 minds. In a world of ever-shrinking attention spans, where consumers flit through social media sites and skip right past online ads, advertisers are turning to neuroscience to better understand how to steer buyers toward their products. \u201cPeople are not governed by the rational side of their brains, so the majority of purchase decisions are made irrationally,\u201d says Itiel Dror, a Harvard-trained neuroscientist engaged by London consultants BrandOpus to test the redesign of a logo for Canada\u2019s  . Dror asked 1,700 shoppers in seven countries to match phrases such as \u201cfamily,\u201d \u201cwarmth,\u201d \u201cmass-produced,\u201d and \u201cfactory\u201d with both McCain\u2019s old logo -- the company name inside a plain black box -- and a new one depicting a sun setting over farmland. McCain is rolling out the new version in 160 countries. These companies use methods such as eye tracking, brain scanners, and facial coding -- cameras that analyze people\u2019s expressions and assess their mood second by second -- to determine reactions to ads. The Neuromarketing Science & Business Association, started in 2012, has more than 1,000 members in 91 countries. The field helps advertisers create simple messages that \u201cdeliberately mix conscious recall with unconscious,\u201d says Dan Machen, director of innovation at HeyHuman, a neuroscience-focused ad agency in London. \u201cWe need to think of the recipient\u2019s brain as an already over-clocked and overloaded system.\u201d The industry\u2019s traditional powers are taking notice. Millward Brown, a research arm of ad giant  , says it started exploring neuroscience four years ago and that it now uses facial coding to test every TV spot it works on. In April, London ad agency Dentsu Aegis purchased Forbes Consulting Group, a neuroscience company in Massachusetts. And ratings giant Nielsen in May bought Innerscope Research, a neuroscience firm in Boston that\u2019s helped companies such as Campbell Soup Co. and Yahoo! Inc. study customers via biometric tests that monitor heart rates and skin conductivity. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re seeing an uptick not only in business, but also in the diversity of clients and the number of those making bigger investments,\u201d says Carl Marci, a neuropsychiatrist with an M.D. from Harvard who co-founded Innerscope a decade ago. For one Innerscope project last year at Time Warner Inc.\u2019s media lab, the company hooked participants up to facial trackers and eye scanners as they watched Conan, Dallas, Men at Work, and other TV shows. Innerscope used the devices to measure reactions to placement within the shows of brands such as Samsung, M&Ms, and Pop-Tarts. Scientists could then decipher when product placement was too obvious -- characterized by participant frowns or snickers -- or so subtle that it wasn\u2019t even noticed. \u201cBiometrics allows us to eliminate any bias in response, and we get a real sense of engagement,\u201d says Howard Shimmel, chief research officer at Time Warner\u2019s Turner Broadcasting. Neuro-Insight, a neuromarketing firm in London, last year helped Twitter Inc. assess reactions to content by fitting people with headsets to measure brain activity while online. The researchers found that when the subjects browsed their Twitter timelines, their brains were almost as active as when they were opening physical mail\u2014and far more engaged than when they were, say, reading websites or watching video. Another insight of potential value to advertisers: When scrolling quickly through a timeline, users didn\u2019t register brand icons unless they were simple and boldly colored, according to Heather Andrew, chief executive officer of Neuro-Insight. \u201cThose things that people don\u2019t know how to put into words,\u201d she says, \u201cwe can measure.\u201d","timestamp":1435795260.0,"participant_ids":["CPB:US","FB:US","1175Z:CN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-02\/how-facebook-and-campbell-soup-are-trying-to-read-your-mind","subject":"How Facebook and Campbell Soup Are Trying to Read Your Mind"},{"body":" Morgan Stanley said it hired former hedge fund manager Kay Haigh as global head of emerging markets in London, within its foreign exchange and developing markets business.

BHP now forecasts production to peak in the mid-2020s at between 935 million tons and 985 million tons, down from as much as 1.1 billion tons. \"I want to reaffirm my commitment and belief that the about a billion tons by 2030 is a damn good estimate,\" Andrew Harding, Rio\u2019s chief executive of iron ore, said Thursday in an investor briefing. \"It\u2019s the best one out there.\" The differing steel forecasts highlight comments last month by Glencore Plc\u2019s Ivan Glasenberg that the largest mining companies have been wrong-footed on slower growth in China, with demand getting tricky to call. The nation has been the center of recent global market volatility amid signs its economy may be headed for a hard landing. \u201cThis is an interesting conundrum for investors,\u201d Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, said by phone. However, \u201cthe market generally doesn\u2019t agree\u201d with the assessment of the miners, taking a more pessimistic view of likely demand in China, he said. Rio fell 0.6 percent to close at A$49.27 in Sydney. It has dropped 15 percent this year as concern over faltering China growth has sent iron prices tumbling 20 percent in 2015, eroding profits for the largest producers. China\u2019s steel output fell 1.3 percent in the first half after peaking last year, according to the China Iron & Steel Association, which sees production declining to about 807 million tons this year. Slowing steel output in China will be among factors that\u2019ll see demand for domestic and imported iron ore fall by about 60 million tons between 2018 to 2025, Citigroup Inc. said in May. Independent economist Andy Xie forecasts steel output may drop below 500 million tons in the next decade. \"Our Chinese steel production and demand forecast is continually reviewed and refined,\" Vivek Tulpule, Rio\u2019s head of economics and markets, said at the briefing. \"We\u2019ve devoted significant resources to the question.\" Rio\u2019s iron ore and steel\u00a0assessments are\u00a0based on research on macroeconomic developments, industry costs, production trends and consumption drivers, according to\u00a0Tulpule. China will continue to play an enormously important role, he said. Rio cited residential and residential replacement, as well as automotive demand, driving steel output. A three-fold increase in obsolete Chinese scrap in the next 15 years will displace some iron ore requirements, the company said in an investor presentation. About a quarter of China\u2019s current urban residential building stock will be demolished by 2030, and newly built houses will be more steel-intensive than those they replace, Tulpule said. Passenger vehicles will rise by 280 million over the same period, a threefold increase, he estimates. After decades of rapid growth spurred an unprecedented expansion in steel production, China\u2019s now grappling with excess capacity as a property-led slowdown crimps demand. The country last year recorded the weakest annual expansion since 1990 and the economy will probably slow further in 2015. Emerging markets will also play an increasingly significant role in the iron ore market, with non-Chinese steel demand expected to increase by 65 percent by 2030, London-based Rio said. India and Southeast Asian countries will be the largest regions for steel demand after China.","timestamp":1441242469.0,"participant_ids":["0730100D:AU","BHP:AU"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-03\/rio-keeps-1-billion-ton-china-steel-output-after-bhp-cuts-view","subject":"Rio Sticks to Bullish China Steel Outlook After BHP Cuts"},{"body":" Richard E. Cheney, a former Hill & Knowlton chairman who was among the first public relations executives to advise on mergers and acquisitions before resigning to practice psychoanalysis, has died. He was 94. He died on Sept. 2 at his home in New York City after a long illness. His death was announced Sunday in an online notice. Cheney, who was Hill & Knowlton chairman from 1987 to 1991, specialized in advising companies involved in M&A during a 33-year career at the New York-based public relations firm. Shortly after joining the company in 1960, he was assigned to guide the Dallas-based brothers John and Clint Murchison in a successful proxy   for Alleghany Corp., which controlled the New York Central Railroad and a group of investment funds. Cheney said his bosses tapped him for the deal because he had prior experience in financial public relations. \u201cNo one else at the firm had worked on Wall Street,\u201d he said, according to 1986 New York Times story. \u201cI was the only one who knew the difference between a debenture and a manhole.\u201d In the 1980s, he helped Walt Disney Co. fend off corporate raider Saul Steinberg and advised billionaire T. Boone Pickens in a bid for Gulf Oil Corp., as well as Bendix Corp. in its attempt to acquire Martin Marietta Corp., according to the Times. In the 1970s, he assisted publisher Houghton Mifflin Co. to thwart a takeover by Western Pacific Industries Inc. and advised Foremost-McKesson Inc., a San Francisco-based drug and liquor distributor, in turning away investor Victor Posner. While Cheney, who is no relation to the former U.S. vice president, was working at  , he also attended the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village, unbeknownst to colleagues and clients. For two years of his training, he spent Saturdays in a locked ward at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in Parsippany, New Jersey. In 1994, a year after resigning from Hill & Knowlton, by then a unit of London-based WPP Plc, the world\u2019s largest advertising company, he began his career as a psychoanalyst in Manhattan. \u201cWhy did I do this? What caused me to turn away from a lucrative crap game run for jackals and to open my own psychoanalytic office where I treat patients at fees based on what they can afford?\u201d he said in a 1996   to the Institute for Public Relations in New York. \u201cWho knew how or why I got where I was? As far as I could tell, it was all chance. But surely being alive was for more than this.\u201d Cheney discussed his new work in the 2003 Times story. \u201cI love it,\u201d he said, according to the newspaper. \u201cWhen you go through something with somebody, it helps you grow. Maybe you grow in a takeover, but not in the same way.\u201d He said \u201cpublic relations was a game,\u201d according to the article. \u201cIt was a fun game, but it was really just a game.\u201d Richard Eugene Cheney was born on Aug. 30, 1921, in Pana, Illinois, to Royal Cheney and the former Nelle Henke, according to Marquis Who\u2019s Who. His father was a grocer who went bankrupt in the Depression. After his parents divorced, he was raised by an aunt and uncle, the Times said in 2003. He graduated from   in Galesburg, Illinois. He was in the U.S. Navy from 1943 to 1947, serving in a mine-sweeper fleet and as a public information officer, attaining the rank of lieutenant junior grade. After the war, Cheney attended the University of Chicago, and then moved to New York. He worked at a public relations trade magazine and, starting in 1955, became head of financial public relations at Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., a predecessor of Exxon Mobil Corp. From there he moved to Hill & Knowlton. His survivors include his wife, the former Virginia Burns, whom he married in 1966 and their children, Benjamin and Annie; two children from his first marriage, Christopher and Elyn MacInnis; and four grandchildren, according to the  .

After underperforming regional rivals Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Singapore Airlines Ltd. for most of the last five years, a 167 percent surge in Qantas\u2019s stock over the past 12 months has turned the tables. Even after the company\u2019s best profit in seven years Thursday sparked a 6.1 percent slump with shareholders taking profits, it remains the best performer of the trio. \u201cThe problem Singapore and Cathay have is that they\u2019ve just seen this incredible growth in capacity,\u201d said Tony Webber, an independent aviation analyst and former Qantas chief economist. \u201cSingapore has suffered from the growth of AirAsia Bhd. and Jetstar Asia and their own capacity in SilkAir and Scoot, and Cathay has suffered from more people flying directly into China.\u201d Qantas on Thursday promised to buy eight Boeing Co. 787-9 Dreamliners and return A$505 million ($370 million) to shareholders after posting A$975 million in earnings before tax and one-time items over the 12 months ended June 30. While that amount was greater than what Qantas earned during the preceding six years of Joyce\u2019s tenure, the share fall was the sharpest since February 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s rallied so hard that it\u2019s just becoming a more mature investment thesis, and people are looking for excuses to rotate out,\u201d George Boubouras, who manages about A$900 million including Qantas stock as chief investment officer of Contango Asset Management Ltd., said by phone from Melbourne. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great story. We\u2019ve tripled our investment since we\u2019ve had it.\u201d The stock fell 6.1 percent to A$3.53 in Sydney trading, after rising to as much as A$3.90 earlier in the day. Shareholders who bought into Australia\u2019s largest airline, known as the \u201cFlying Kangaroo,\u201d in July 2010 saw their investments underperform the other two carriers for most of the four years to December. They\u2019ve now made a 43 percent return, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared to negative 3 percent at Cathay and negative 21 percent result at Singapore Air. While a A$597 million reduction in the company\u2019s fuel bill amid falling oil prices has helped, the scale of the recovery is down to A$894 million of benefits over the past year from Qantas\u2019s A$2 billion cost-cutting program, Joyce told a media event in Sydney Thursday. When fuel costs drop \u201cevery airline gets the benefit, but Qantas is outperforming the rest of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cQantas this year, with these results, will make more than Virgin Australia, Air New Zealand, Singapore Air, and Etihad put together.\u201d Qantas and its main domestic competitor Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. engaged in a bruising market-share war last year, driving a combined A$3.2 billion of losses at the two carriers. Virgin was supported in that fight by the three foreign carriers, who became its biggest shareholders and infused cash into the business by buying new shares.

After surveying the market, Evergrande, owned by billionaire Hui Ka Yan, concluded \u201cthe current timing is immature\u201d to enter into solar power, the Guangzhou-based company said in an e-mailed statement to questions seeking an update on the plans. No funds have so far been spent on the solar business, the company added. \u201cInvesting in solar power doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have safe returns,\u201d said Wang Xiaoting, a Hong Kong-based analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Outsiders are better to \u201cconsider other predictable investments.\u201d The decision to steer clear of solar comes as Chinese developers that used debt to fund their rapid expansion are coming under greater strain as the nation\u2019s real estate market slows. Even by Chinese standards, Hui\u2019s   for solar energy, which was outlined in a National Business Daily newspaper story last year, was grand. The company, which specializes in real estate, dairy and sports, had planned to build 9.2 gigawatts of photovoltaic projects in the northern city of Zhangjiakou, the National Daily said in September, citing Hui. Projects of that scale would equal about 29 percent of China\u2019s total installed solar capacity at the end of 2014, according to BNEF data. The stock of Evergrande\u2019s Hong Kong-listed business, Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd., fell for the first time in four days, declining as much as 1.7 percent and was down 0.3 percent at HK$3.63 as of 10:49 a.m. local time. The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose as much as 0.8 percent. Evergrande\u2019s original plan was confirmed by a public relations manager, who asked not to be identified because she isn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. New home prices in February fell on month in 66 of the 70 cities tracked by the government despite interest-rate cuts and the removal of some property curbs. Sales are falling at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis, BNP Paribas SA economist Richard Iley wrote in a March 18 note. The financial health of Chinese developers has also come under scrutiny following the near-default of Shenzhen-based Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. The company, which is currently negotiating with creditors to restructure its debt, said it was unprofitable last year and disclosed a doubling of outstanding debts in the six months ended Dec. 31. Evergrande Real Estate joins peers including China Vanke Co. and Country Garden Holdings Co. in reporting a drop in sales this year. The average net debt-to-equity ratio for 18 Chinese developers rose to 95.7 percent as of June 30, jumping from 66.2 percent a year earlier. If treating perpetual equity instruments as debt rather than as equity, Evergrande was the most indebted, with net debt nearly triple its common equity, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Evergrande obtained 100 billion yuan in credit lines from four Chinese banks including Bank of China Ltd. in the past two months as sales declined. Stock investors \u201cmay not be interested in seeing the company entering an unfamiliar business,\u201d Jeffrey Gao, a Hong Kong-based equity analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said. China has been boosting the use of solar power to help cut emissions, spurring interests among companies such as GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd. and Evergrande.

The Shares plunged. Profit jumped almost sixfold to HK$1.97 billion ($254 million) in the six months ended in June, trailing the HK$2.22 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of six analysts, Hong Kong-based Cathay said in a statement Wednesday. Sales in the first six months declined 0.9 percent to HK$50.4 billion. Cathay shares fell the most in more than six years after the results, which included a HK$3.74 billion loss from  . Last year\u2019s slump in the crude oil market had left several Asian carriers holding hedges placed when oil prices were higher, adding to the challenges for Chief Executive Officer Ivan Chu. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed set of earnings,\u201d said Mohshin Aziz, a Malayan Banking Bhd. analyst in Kuala Lumpur. \u201cOn the revenue side things were very weak, much weaker than expected. Fortunately on the cost side, they seem to be making a lot of improvements.\u201d The airline had an unrealized fuel hedging loss of HK$7.42 billion at the end of June, Cathay said in the statement. Cathay\u2019s shares fell 7.7 percent, the biggest decline since April 27, 2009, to close at HK$15.38 in Hong Kong. The stock dropped for an eighth consecutive day, the longest losing streak in more than two years. Last year\u2019s sudden plunge in oil prices left several Asian carriers holding bets made when crude oil prices were around $100 a barrel. Oil\u2019s drop and airlines\u2019 hedging losses are reminiscent of 2008 and 2009, when Cathay, Chinese carriers and Singapore Airlines Ltd. all reported millions of dollars in losses because of their bets on fuel. \u201cManaging the risk associated with volatile fuel prices remains a priority,\u201d John Slosar, Cathay\u2019s chairman, said in the statement. \u201cIn the first half of 2015, lower fuel costs were partially offset by hedging losses.\u201d In March, after Cathay announced it lost HK$911 million on fuel hedges in 2014, Chu stressed that the company considered hedging an important part of its financial management and would   the practice. Only a portion of Cathay\u2019s fuel buys are locked in at a set price, so the airline still sees a net benefit if oil prices drop -- and it\u2019s protected if they rise again steeply, he said. Fuel is the airline\u2019s single biggest expense. The airline\u2019s fuel hedging extends to 2019, Cathay said in Wednesday\u2019s statement. Passenger yields dropped 9.3 percent in the first half from a year earlier, beyond the 5 percent to 6 percent decline expected by UOB Kay Hian Pte. and Malayan Banking Bhd. Yields dropped on all sectors, with those to North America 10.2 percent and Europe 10.1 percent posting the biggest declines, according to Cathay\u2019s statement. Economy-class demand was strong on long-haul routes, Slosar said in the statement. Premium class demand was robust on short-haul routes but was weaker than expected on some long-haul routes. \u201cStrong competition, a significant reduction in fuel surcharges, foreign currency movements and the fact that a higher proportion of passengers were connecting through Hong Kong put downward pressure on yield,\u201d Slosar said. Cathay has ordered new planes and has added more routes as it seeks to counter competition from the Middle East carriers and the Big Three from mainland China -- Air China Ltd., China Southern Airlines Co. and China Eastern Airlines Corp. Cathay\u2019s passenger numbers increased 8.8 percent to 16.8 million in the first half of the year and occupancy increased to 85.9 percent in that period. \u201cCathay is leveraging effectively on the demand recovery for long-haul flights in and out of Hong Kong,\u201d Maybank\u2019s Mohshin wrote in an Aug. 10 note. \u201cIts year-to-date passenger load factors are at record highs, while cargo load factor has shown good year-on-year improvement.\u201d Yet there are challenges. First China\u2019s economy logged its slowest growth in more than 20 years. Then about $3 trillion was wiped out from the country\u2019s stock market since mid-June. This month, the yuan was devalued. With 60 percent of Cathay\u2019s passengers starting their journeys in mainland China, any negative impact in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy is an issue for Asia\u2019s biggest international carrier. \u201cEven without the yuan change, mainland China was becoming increasingly challenging for Cathay as visitors considered other destinations and alternative stopover hubs,\u201d said Will Horton, a Hong Kong-based analyst at consultancy CAPA Centre for Aviation. A 1 percent drop in air-travel growth in China -- poised to become the world\u2019s biggest market in two decades -- could slash $5.6 million from Cathay\u2019s annual profit, according to Credit Suisse Group AG estimates.

Heinz is ratcheting up the pressure on other foodmakers to shape up or seek deals of their own. The two food giants are   to create North America\u2019s third-largest food and beverage company in a deal backed by 3G Capital and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 3G has been shaking up the food industry with its penchant for acquisitions and reputation for merciless cost-cutting. To keep up, rivals in packaged food will need to follow its model. Mondelez International Inc. and Campbell Soup Co. are among those already taking steps to comb through their budgets, and others are likely to follow. The next step for some may be to join forces. Nestle SA, which will face a tougher competitor in the new Kraft Heinz Co., could decide the time is right to bid on $32 billion Cheerios maker General Mills Inc., said Kevin Dreyer of Gabelli Funds. The Kraft transaction, announced Wednesday, also adds support to the benefits   PepsiCo Inc.\u2019s snack business with Mondelez, according to Sachin Shah of New York-based Albert Fried & Co. \u201cEveryone in the industry is going to be thinking, \u2018We could be next, so let\u2019s pull out all the stops to increase value as a standalone company,\u2019\u201d Dreyer said in a phone interview from Rye, New York. Gabelli parent Gamco Investors Inc. oversees shares of Kraft,  General Mills and several other consumer-goods makers. \u201cIf they can\u2019t on a standalone basis, then there may be other strategic options for a lot of companies,\u201d he said. Soy milk producer WhiteWave Foods Co. or Emerald nuts maker Diamond Foods Inc. are also ripe for a takeover, said Alexia Howard of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Buffett and 3G likely aren\u2019t done with dealmaking either, though they may take a hiatus to digest Kraft. General Mills, Mondelez and Kellogg Co. are among their potential next targets. \u201cThis puts the entire group on alert,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, a St. Louis-based analyst at Edward Jones & Co. \u201cThere are too many of these food players and there\u2019s very little growth if you\u2019re not natural, organics or protein. So how do you grow? You buy. I think this is just the beginning.\u201d The Kraft transaction, which values the macaroni-and-cheese maker at about $46 billion before net debt, is the biggest food deal on record. It surpasses Buffett and 3G Capital\u2019s takeover of Heinz for more than $23 billion in 2013. Berkshire   for 3G-owned Burger King Worldwide Inc.\u2019s acquisition of Tim Hortons Inc. last year. When it makes an acquisition, 3G whittles down expenses at the target. The Brazilian-led investment firm has been able to increase profitability even at companies that were pretty efficient to begin with, said Yarbrough of Edward Jones. Kraft and Heinz are aiming to trim $1.5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017. 3G\u2019s approach to slashing costs may serve as a model for other large North American packaged-food companies seeking to improve returns, according to Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cAny inefficient food company had best \u20183G\u2019 themselves if they desire to ward off the new barbarians in the grocery aisle,\u201d David Rolfe, who manages about $11 billion including Berkshire shares at Wedgewood Partners Inc., wrote in an e-mail. Cost cuts may only go so far in helping rebuild revenue growth. The industry\u2019s profits have been crimped as consumers shift toward healthier foods. To overcome the challenges, packaged-food companies will probably need to get bigger. Nestle has been considered an obvious buyer of General Mills by some analysts and investors because the two companies already have a joint venture for cereal sales. The Swiss chocolate maker now may finally feel the push to make an approach. The Kraft-Heinz merger relies on similar logic to what Nelson Peltz used to argue for a combination of PepsiCo and Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies that split with Kraft in 2012, said Albert Fried\u2019s Shah.

Those could appeal to   owner of Birds Eye frozen vegetables, David Palmer, a New York-based analyst at RBC Capital Markets, a unit of Royal Bank of Canada, wrote in a report Wednesday.

While a return to levels of dealmaking not seen since 2007 may have delighted bankers last year, 20 percent of mergers worth more than $10 billion announced in the last two years have collapsed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deals that failed wiped out about $278 billion of the total $784 billion in announced deals. Pfizer Inc.\u2019s unsolicited bid last year for AstraZeneca Plc accounts for almost half that number, after political pressure and disagreements over price ended the $120 billion deal. As deal values rise and companies of similar size and scale attempt to combine, the chances of success may also decline. \u201cSo-called mergers of equals have particular risks,\u201d said Stephen Wilkinson, global head of mergers and acquisitions at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, because \u201ccompromises are required. Sometimes those compromises are not reached.\u201d While it took only three months for AbbVie Inc. to withdraw its $55 billion offer for U.K. drugmaker Shire Plc as tax inversion rules shifted in the U.S., advertising groups Publicis Groupe SA and Omnicom Group Inc. negotiated for almost a year before calling off their $35 billion merger of equals, amid disagreements over the management of the combined firm. \u201cA long gestation period between announcing and closing a deal can add to the risk of failure, as there is a greater chance that factors can arise which cause the parties to re-evaluate the deal,\u201d Wilkinson said. One reason for the long gestation period for announced deals could be Europe\u2019s regulatory environment. \u201cThe approval process is more cumbersome and complex than the American one because both the European Union and member states need to sign off on deals, and may have different requirements,\u201d said Julian Birkinshaw, a professor at London Business School. Cultural differences can also play a role -- something that Swiss Holcim and Paris-based Lafarge will have learned during their months of negotiations. Though the two countries are geographically close, in practice they are as different culturally as is \u201chumanly possible,\u201d Birkinshaw said. The Holcim-Lafarge transaction, which will value France\u2019s Lafarge at 28.2 billion euros ($30.2 billion) including net debt, isn\u2019t done yet. The deal isn\u2019t scheduled to close until July, the companies haven\u2019t yet chosen a CEO to run the combined operation, and Holcim shareholders need to vote on whether to issue new shares. Phil Rosenberg, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., puts the chance of failure at 50 percent.","timestamp":1426855386.0,"participant_ids":["HOLN:VX","LG:FP"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-20\/holcim-lafarge-avoids-jinx-of-europe-s-mega-merger-fatality-rate","subject":"Holcim-Lafarge Avoids Jinx of Europe\u2019s Mega-Merger Fatality Rate"},{"body":" In less than a year, Lafarge SA Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont has gone from celebrated co-architect of the world\u2019s biggest cement merger to one of the deal\u2019s main obstacles. Holcim Ltd., which in April agreed to a $40 billion merger with Lafarge, is pushing for an executive other than Lafont to lead the new entity, according to people familiar with the matter. The Swiss company is questioning his ability to reach savings targets because Holcim has outperformed Lafarge on everything from sales to profit since the deal was announced, they said. Lafont and Holcim managers have also clashed over issues including strategy, they said. The dispute over leadership by the 58-year-old Frenchman shows how a clash of personalities can become the biggest liability in mergers. The gum-chewing, cigar smoking Lafont and the soft-spoken Holcim CEO Bernard Fontana, who was due to remain in his post until the merger completion, have disagreed on key issues from the start, one of the people said. Holcim yesterday said it won\u2019t pursue the planned combination in its present form and wants Lafarge to accept management changes and a stake of less than the initially agreed 47 percent in the combined business. Paris-based Lafarge, in turn, said it\u2019s willing to compromise on the exchange ratio, though not on leadership or other terms. Both companies declined to comment on any differences beyond their official statements. For Lafont, becoming CEO of the combined entity would mean handing greater control to other executives as he would relinquish the combined titles of chairman and CEO, which he\u2019s held at Lafarge for eight years. While Lafont is an experienced dealmaker, some of his acquisitions turned sour. In 2007, he oversaw the purchase of cement operations from Egypt\u2019s Orascom Construction Industries for 10.2 billion euros ($11 billion), saddling the company with debt just as construction activity slowed. The debt eventually led to Lafarge losing its investment grade status. It also increased exposure to countries that have recently been hit by war, terrorism or political turmoil, including Egypt, Irak, Syria and Nigeria, raising concerns among some investors about Lafont\u2019s strategy. Still, the current haggling over leadership and terms isn\u2019t a surprise because Lafarge\u2019s weaker position has emboldened Holcim shareholders to seek better terms, according to several investors. \u201cUltimately, it is a question of control, with Holcim aiming to extract a greater say in the new company,\u201d said Robert Gardiner, a analyst at Davy. \u201cAnd change in the proposed CEO may suggest some difference of opinion in future direction.\u201d Lafarge advisers are concerned that Holcim is using the management demands as a reason to reduce the price of the deal, or kill it altogether, according to one of the people. Finding a Lafarge executive other than Lafont to run the combined entity could be difficult, that person said. Lafont, who joined Lafarge in 1983, hasn\u2019t been afraid to make tough calls on cutting costs and achieving savings targets. He sold Lafarge\u2019s gypsum operations to trim debt that had been inflated by the Orascom deal. In 2006, the year he was appointed CEO, he decided to sell Lafarge\u2019s roofing business while spending $3.5 billion to buy the rest of the company\u2019s North American business. Holcim and Lafarge have predicted the merger will lead to cost savings of 1.4 billion euros annually, giving them an advantage over rivals as a global recession eroded demand for building materials and forced some kilns to run at a loss. Uncertainty over the terms of the merger and concern that it could still collapse triggered a 6.3 percent decline in Lafarge shares in Paris trading. Holcim lost 1.3 percent in Zurich. While both Holcim and Lafarge have experienced declining revenue and cash flow, Holcim has had less of a slide since the deal was agreed, on average. And Holcim\u2019s Ebitda margin -- or the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization it reaped on sales -- exceeded Lafarge\u2019s in the period, on average. If the merger fails, Holcim-Lafarge would join a growing list of mega-deals involving European companies that have collapsed before completion. Last year, Publicis Groupe SA and Omnicom Group Inc. called off their $35 billion merger of equals amid disagreements over the management of the combined firm, which would have been the world\u2019s largest advertising group. In 2012, BAE Systems Plc and the company now known as Airbus Group NV were forced to scuttle a deal they said would transform the European aerospace sector, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel objected. Representatives for Holcim and Lafarge met yesterday and while there was progress on reaching a compromise, outstanding disagreements remain, one of the people said. Still, the companies should have addressed their differences earlier, said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Phil Roseberg. \u201cThe boards are not nearly as united as we expected,\u201d he said in a note to investors, adding that \u201cthis very public showing of disunity\u201d has put the deal at risk.","timestamp":1426527599.0,"participant_ids":["LG:FP","HOLN:VX"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-16\/how-lafarge-s-ceo-went-from-holcim-merger-architect-to-obstacle","subject":"How Lafarge\u2019s CEO Went From Holcim Merger Architect to Obstacle"},{"body":"Nissan Motor Co.\u2019s Chinese joint venture has accused billionaire Jack Ma\u2019s soccer club of violating a sponsorship agreement by removing its advertising logo from the team jerseys before the final match of Asia\u2019s top club competition held on Saturday.

Earnings before tax and one-time items were A$367 million ($289 million) in the six months ended Dec. 31, Qantas said in a statement Thursday. Its shares rose 5.3 percent to A$2.96 at 10:24 a.m. in Sydney. The result vindicates   to cut A$2 billion in costs and eliminate 5,000 jobs from the 95-year-old airline amid a price war with domestic rival Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. The so-called Flying Kangaroo\u2019s shares have more than doubled since October as investors bet that the cheapest fuel in at least four years and a truce with Virgin will buoy profits. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see some green shoots of a real turnaround in the airline industry,\u201d Ross MacMillan, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Sydney, said by phone before the results. \u201cThe company\u2019s done a quite outstanding job of reducing costs and still has a great position in the domestic market.\u201d The earnings beat the A$339 million average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg and compared to a A$252 million first-half loss a year earlier. Net income was A$203 million, according to Thursday\u2019s statement. In December, the airline   its profit before tax and one-time items would be between A$300 million and A$350 million. Joyce said that demand in the second half of the year looked stable and the full-year fuel bill will be no more than A$4 billion. The result Thursday underlines the carrier\u2019s rapid recovery from the record A$2.84 billion annual net loss six months earlier and the cancellation of its investment-grade credit   in January 2014. Joyce, who took over in 2008 and reshuffled his   last year, has said he plans to stay in the role to see through the cost cuts. The company was the best-performing stock on the S&P\/ASX 200 index over the six months to Dec. 31, with a 90 percent increase that compared to a 0.3 percent improvement in the benchmark. Its international unit posted the first half-year of profit since at least 2011, with earnings before interest and tax, also known as Ebit, of A$59 million during the period. At Qantas domestic -- which was driven into losses six months earlier as it added flights and cut prices to defend its 65 percent market share against Virgin Australia -- Ebit was A$227 million. Ebit was A$81 million at budget carrier Jetstar and A$160 million at the Frequent Flyer division, Qantas said. The return to profit illustrates the reversal of factors that weighed on Qantas\u2019s earnings as commodity prices boomed. The rising price of oil swelled a fuel bill that reached A$4.5 billion last year, accounting for about 28 percent of costs. Demand for Australian commodities also lifted the value of the country\u2019s currency, encouraging overseas airlines to fly to Australian cities and tap high-paying customers. The competition helped drive Qantas\u2019s international unit into losses. At the same time, Virgin Australia started adding business class seats to compete directly with Qantas on domestic routes. The changes put the supply of airline seats ahead of passenger demand, pushing down prices. Earnings from Qantas\u2019s full-fare domestic network fell 92 percent to A$30 million in the year ended June. Those factors have now reversed. The price of Singapore jet fuel fell 34 percent in Australian dollars during the six months to December. Australia\u2019s currency weakened 13 percent over the same period. The number of new seats being added by overseas airlines flying to Australia has slowed, the carrier\u2019s outgoing Chief Financial Officer Gareth Evans  . Domestic competition has also diminished, with airlines cutting the number of available seats by about 3 percent from a year earlier in November,  . That\u2019s the fastest pace of decline since October 2011, when Qantas grounded its global fleet amid industrial action, and compares to a five-year average capacity increase of 4 percent. Yield, a measure of revenues per passenger per kilometer, was 10.33 Australian cents in the most recent half, from a 11-year low of 10.02 Australian cents six months earlier. Free cash flow was A$194 million. Tino La Spina, who\u2019ll take over from Evans as chief financial officer by March, must decide whether to dedicate the money to retiring debt, buying new aircraft or rewarding shareholders who haven\u2019t been paid a dividend since 2009.

Getting there may require putting off plans to buy Dreamliner aircraft. Bonds sold by Australia\u2019s biggest carrier are at record-low yield premiums on speculation cost cuts, cheaper fuel and a tie-up with Emirates Airline will deliver the strongest profits since 2008. Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce may need to make more sacrifices, including delaying purchases of Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliners a second time, National Australia Bank Ltd. says. \u201cIt all comes back to where Qantas\u2019s priorities lie,\u201d Michael Bush, head of credit research at NAB in Melbourne, said by phone. Better cash flows are freeing up money to spend on either debt reduction or new planes, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a bit less sure whether they\u2019re strong enough to support both imperatives.\u201d The so-called Flying Kangaroo had stumbled for much of the past six years after safety issues including a mid-air engine explosion, a fare war with Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. and a soaring Aussie dollar. Qantas credit-default swaps are the best performing contracts globally over the past year among airlines tracked by Bloomberg, down 120 basis points. Japan\u2019s ANA Holdings Inc., the biggest Dreamliner owner with 83 planes, is the next best. Qantas faces a \u201cunique opportunity\u201d to replace its remaining 747 fleet with \u201cnew next-generation aircraft\u201d, the carrier\u2019s new Chief Financial Officer Tino La Spina told a May 12 investor conference. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor\u2019s said in February it probably won\u2019t raise Qantas\u2019s credit ratings \u201cfor at least the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d Qantas spokesman Andrew McGinnes noted Joyce and La Spina\u2019s May 12 comments and declined to comment separately on the questions of fleet renewal and credit ratings when contacted by Bloomberg via e-mail. The Australian airline has 50 options and purchase rights for Dreamliners that it can receive starting in 2017, the company said Aug. 28. They\u2019re worth as much as $12.86 billion at Boeing\u2019s  ; large customers like Qantas typically get a discount. Upgrading planes is costly, though there\u2019s a \u201cmassive improvement from a customer service perspective,\u201d La Spina said in May. A   on ANA\u2019s Dreamliners said they\u2019d go out of their way to book flights on the aircraft, according to a 2012 survey by the carrier, a launch customer of the model. Dreamliners are also about 20 percent more fuel-efficient than current jets,  . That would help with Qantas\u2019s A$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion) fuel bill, its biggest cost item. At the same time, skipping or delaying the first Dreamliner deliveries might be worthwhile if it helps convince ratings companies of Qantas\u2019s commitment to pay down debt, according to Bush. Stripped of investment-grade ratings by S&P in 2013 and Moody\u2019s Investors Service in 2014 amid high fuel prices and competition that pushed revenue below operating costs, Qantas\u2019s improving prospects have made it the best-performing stock on Australia\u2019s main index since September. It will earn net income of A$586 million in the year to June, according to the median of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The better outlook has made borrowing costs cheaper. It has also seen the chance of Qantas reneging on its debts in the year ahead stay below 0.3 percent this year, a level consistent with the second-lowest investment grade, according to Bloomberg\u2019s default-risk model. The yield premium over the swap rate on the airline\u2019s A$400 million of May 2022 bonds dropped to as little as 255 basis points in May, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices. That\u2019s the least on record and more than a percentage point below the 400-basis-point spread the notes were issued at last year when the carrier became the first junk-rated borrower to issue bonds in Australia\u2019s domestic market. The question is how long it will take to persuade ratings companies that Qantas deserves an upgrade, said George Bishay, a fixed-income portfolio manager at BT Investment Management. The downgrades were based more on Qantas\u2019s tougher competitive environment against second-ranked domestic carrier Virgin than the shape of its balance sheet, Bishay said. While there\u2019s currently a truce in that battle, the risk of renewed conflict hasn\u2019t gone away, he said. \u201cThey will get back to investment grade, but it won\u2019t be in the next six months,\u201d he said by phone from Sydney. \u201cIt could be a year, it could be two.\u201d","timestamp":1433329201.0,"participant_ids":["QAN:AU","BA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-03\/qantas-torn-as-boeing-dreamliner-risks-spoiling-escape-from-junk","subject":"Qantas Torn as Boeing Dreamliner Risks Spoiling Escape From Junk"},{"body":" Qantas Airways Ltd. and its partners in the Jetstar Hong Kong budget airline will review the venture after authorities in the city rejected its application for an operating license. Qantas, billionaire Stanley Ho\u2019s Shun Tak Holdings Ltd. and state-controlled China Eastern Airlines Corp. will examine the venture, the Sydney-based carrier said in a   on its website. Hong Kong\u2019s Air Transport Licensing Authority   Thursday that the airline didn\u2019t comply with legal requirements to have its principal place of business in the city. The ruling, more than two years after Jetstar Hong Kong first asked for a license, is a boost for Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., a full-service airline that had opposed Jetstar\u2019s entry into its home market. Cathay controls about half of Hong Kong\u2019s air traffic, and Asia\u2019s biggest international carrier is seeking to defend that dominance as China\u2019s economic growth slows. \u201cCathay has so much political sway in what happens there that I\u2019m not surprised to see them not get it,\u201d Evan Lucas, a market strategist at IG Ltd., said by phone from Sydney. Qantas closed down 3.7 percent at A$3.12 in Sydney, the biggest fall since June 18. Cathay dropped 2.2 percent in Hong Kong to close at HK$19.48, while China Eastern dropped 10 percent in Shanghai to finish at 11.67 yuan, its biggest fall in a month. According to Article 134 of Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law, the local government can issue licenses to airlines that are incorporated in the city and use it as their principal place of business. \u201cThere is no dispute that the day-to-day management would be conducted in Hong Kong and managed\u201d in the city by Jetstar Hong Kong\u2019s CEO, but that\u2019s not enough to meet the criteria for principle place of business, the licensing authority said in its ruling. The low-cost carrier was formed in 2012 as a joint venture between Australia\u2019s Qantas and Shanghai-based China Eastern. Shun Tak joined later as a local partner and has 51 percent of voting rights, with the three parties holding equal economic stakes. Seventy percent of the board is from Hong Kong, according to the Qantas statement. \u201cThe message from this decision is that Hong Kong appears closed to fresh aviation investment even when it is majority locally owned and controlled,\u201d Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said in a statement. \u201cShutting the door to new competition can only serve the vested interests already installed in that market.\u201d Qantas lost A$50 million on its investments in Jetstar Hong Kong and Jetstar Japan in the year ended June 2013 and a further A$70 million in the year ended June 2014, the company said in its annual results last year. It didn\u2019t break down how much of the losses were attributed to each unit. The carrying value of the Jetstar Hong Kong investment was A$10 million as of Dec. 31, 2014, Qantas said today.

That may depend on a Shanghai court battle against the team that beat Apple Inc. in a similar dispute three years ago.  A local company laying claim to Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s Chinese-language brand name, Gao Tong, has enlisted Hejun Vanguard Group, the management consulting firm that helped make Apple pay $60 million in 2012 to use the iPad moniker in China. A trademark suit brought against Qualcomm by Shanghai Gao Tong Semiconductor Co. is slated for a court hearing next month.    \u2018  The trademark case gives Qualcomm a new headache in the world\u2019s second-largest economy after it was fined $975 million by China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission last month over antitrust violations. The San Diego-based maker of digital wireless communications equipment said it wouldn\u2019t challenge the ruling, which also imposed conditions on the local royalties it charges on phone sales.  Tina Asmar, a spokeswoman at Qualcomm, declined to comment on the trademark case.  Both the Qualcomm and Shanghai brands use the same two Chinese characters, which translate roughly to \u201chigh communications.\u201d Shanghai Gao Tong registered five trademarks containing the characters between August 1992 and January 2004, according to the China Patent Trademark Office\u2019s database.  Shanghai Gao Tong is seeking 100 million yuan ($16 million) in damages, according to its June filing in the Shanghai Higher People\u2019s Court. Qualcomm\u2019s use of the trademark is a form of unfair competition, Li said.

PODS, the Florida company claimed, is an acronym for \u201cportable on demand storage,\u201d and U-Haul\u2019s use of the term in its advertising for its U-Box brand constituted unfair competition and would confuse consumers.  The jury agreed and in September 2014 awarded PODS the damages judgment.  Phoenix-based U-Haul asked the judge to reconsider, arguing that the term was generic and not entitled to trademark protection.  On March 11, U.S. District Judge James D. Whittemore said the verdict was \u201cnot contrary to the great weight of evidence\u201d PODS presented that the mark was distinctive.

Sodium borohydride is a compound that, under some conditions, can be used to store, release and reabsorb hydrogen.  The application for the patent was filed in August 2010, with the assistance of Park Vaughan Fleming & Dowler LLP  of Davis, California.  For more patent news, click here.  A Brussels court rejected a request by Sabam, the Belgian association of authors, composers and publishers, that Internet service providers in Belgium pay 3.4 percent of their revenue in copyright fees, PC World reported.  In a March 14 ruling, the court ruled that if Internet service providers don\u2019t modify or initiate the content transmitted on their networks, they are not liable for copyright infringement, according to PC World.  The Belgian government opposed Sabam\u2019s request, saying it violated an e-commerce directive from the European Union mandating that its member countries ensure Internet service providers not be liable for the content they transmit, PC World reported.  Sabam said it will appeal the judgment, which it called out of line with four decisions of the European Court of Justice, the magazine reported.  Georgia State University asked a federal court not to re-open the record in a closely watched copyright case in order to check the school\u2019s compliance with a court order.  The school was responding to a request from several publishers of scholarly works who sued George State University in April 2008 over what the publishers said was unauthorized use of their digital content.  In 2014, a federal appeals court reversed a lower court ruling on copyright law\u2019s \u201cfair use\u201d provision with regard to the academic publishers\u2019 content, and sent the case back to the lower court for a second look at the infringement claims.  The publishers then filed their request for the record\u2019s reopening, saying the court \u201cmust take account of the relevant facts as they currently exist\u201d so it can fashion relief addressing the present situation rather than \u201cconduct that occurred several years ago.\u201d  In its opposition, the school said the publishers were merely recycling old arguments. It said that nothing in the mandate from the federal appeals court suggested nor cited case law require a reopening of the record. The record \u201cwas fully developed at trial and is complete,\u201d the school said in its March 13 filing.  The case is Cambridge University Press v. Becker, 08-cv-01425, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta). The appeals court cases are Cambridge University Press v. J. Albert, 12-14676 and 12-15147, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.  For more copyright news, click here.

Norwegian Air dropped as much as 17 percent to 224.5 kroner, the lowest intraday price since Oct. 2008, and traded 10 percent lower at 4:15 p.m. in Oslo. The stock has fallen 13 percent this year, valuing the Fornebu, Norway-based company at 8.58 billion kroner ($1.12 billion). The 2014 net loss was 1.05 billion kroner compared with profit of 321.6 million kroner a year earlier, the airline said in a statement. The loss was greater than the 686.4 million-krone average of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Operating revenue gained 25 percent to 19.5 billion kroner. Norwegian Air is pursuing one of the industry\u2019s most ambitious growth plans, rolling out a long-haul operation with Boeing Co. 787 planes while swelling its European fleet. Flight-permit delays in the U.S. generated 54 million kroner in expenses in the fourth quarter, with the depreciation of the Norwegian kroner against the dollar and euro contributing to a 3 percent increase in unit costs, the carrier said. \u201cWe took half a billion Norwegian kroner in losses on 2015 hedges in our 2014 results,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Bjoern Kjos said in a Bloomberg TV interview. The carrier will be able to take advantage of lower kerosene prices in 2015, he said. \u201cWe have a very good position going forward contrary to a lot of airlines all over the globe that have hedged heavily.\u201d Fuel expenses rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter, while the cost of contracts to fix spending on jet kerosene this year totaled 459 million kroner last year, the company said. Fuel needs for this year are 30 percent hedged at an average price of $815 a ton, it said. The airline carried 5.65 million passengers in the fourth quarter, a 7.6 percent increase from a year earlier. Ticket revenue per unit fell 3 percent in the period, and dropped 10 percent in the full year, as average fares declined.","timestamp":1423723337.0,"participant_ids":["NAS:NO","0949477D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-12\/norwegian-air-has-wider-than-estimated-loss-on-fuel-hedge","subject":"Norwegian Air Has Wider-Than-Estimated Loss on Fuel Hedge"},{"body":" Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Asia\u2019s largest international airline by passengers, reported profit that lagged analyst estimates as losses from fuel hedging masked gains in passenger numbers. Net income rose 20 percent to HK$3.15 billion ($406 million) in the year ended December, Hong Kong-based Cathay said in a stock exchange statement Wednesday. That compared with the HK$3.49 billion average profit estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 16 analysts. Sales at HK$106 billion matched estimates. Cathay had a HK$911 million loss from hedging its fuel purchases as last year\u2019s sudden crash in oil prices left several Asian carriers holding bets made when crude oil prices were around $100 a barrel. Facing intense competition from Middle East carriers like Emirates and Etihad, Cathay said passenger numbers increased 5.5 percent last year to 31.57 million, as the airline added flights to the U.S. and more travelers came from Northeast Asia. \u201cThis is a fairly robust set of results, but the issue is the size of the realized hedging loss,\u201d said Geoffrey Cheng, BoComm International\u2019s head of transportation and industrial research. Cathay shares closed down 0.6 percent Wednesday at HK$16.94 in Hong Kong trading. Singapore Air Several Asian carriers were projected to suffer paper losses as last year\u2019s sudden crash in oil prices took them by surprise. Carriers will have to account for those hedges or pay charges to unwind contracts prematurely. Cathay said it also has HK$12.5 billion in unrealized losses on its fuel hedges, which will remain in place until 2018. Cathay\u2019s \u201cannual fuel costs actually went up year on year, instead of decreasing, which is primarily due to their fuel hedging losses,\u201d said Ajith Kom, director of Asia transport research at UOB Kay Hian in Singapore. \u201cThe key is whether they can take advantage of current low prices.\u201d Cathay Chief Executive Officer Ivan Chu told Bloomberg TV Wednesday afternoon that the airline is happy with its current hedging position, and that the oil-price decline has been a net positive for Cathay. Oil\u2019s plunge and airlines\u2019 hedging losses are a reprise of 2008 and 2009, when Cathay, Chinese carriers and Singapore Air all reported millions of dollars in losses because of their bets on fuel. Singapore Airlines Ltd. last month reported S$216 million ($156 million) in fuel-hedging losses for 2014. Cathay Chairman John Slosar said at a Wednesday afternoon news briefing that the full benefit of lower oil prices will be felt only this year, and the airline will continue to hedge its fuel purchases \u201cwhere it makes sense.\u201d Martin Murray, Cathay\u2019s finance director, told reporters the carrier has hedged 61% of its fuel needs for this year at $95 a barrel and 60% of its 2016 needs at $85 per barrel. That proportion falls to 50% in 2017 at $89 a barrel and 37% at $82 per barrel in 2018, Murray said. Passenger yield, which measures money earned from carrying travelers each kilometer and is a key indicator of an airline\u2019s performance, fell 1.8 percent to 67.3 Hong Kong cents, the company said in its earnings statement. Yield from carrying cargo and mail declined 5.6 percent to HK$2.19. Cargo demand is beginning to pick up for carriers across Asia. Cathay was one of the five biggest airlines in the world in terms of freight carried in 2013. Last year \u201csaw the first significant boost in volumes since 2010, a trend we expect to continue this year,\u201d Tony Tyler, IATA director-general and chief executive, said March 10. Cathay currently operates cargo services to 45 freighter destinations around the world. It launched new freighter services to Calgary, Mexico City and Phnom Penh last year, and started a specialized air freight service for wine. Chief Executive Chu said when he took over last year that he planned to ramp up investments in new products. In the past year, Cathay has announced it\u2019s investing in a U.S.-based sustainable biofuel developer to help it achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020. Cathay also is retiring its Airbus Group NV A340-300s as part of a fleet modernization program that\u2019s seeing the airline replace older, less-efficient planes with newer models from Airbus and Boeing Co. Cathay currently operates 147 aircraft, with an average fleet age of 8.09 years.","timestamp":1426644786.0,"participant_ids":["293:HK","0949477D:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-18\/cathay-pacific-profit-lags-behind-estimates-on-fuel-hedging-loss","subject":"Cathay Pacific Reports Gain in Passengers But Fuel-Hedging Losses Hit Profit"},{"body":"Hapag-Lloyd AG adjusted its initial public offering plan for the third time this month, potentially depriving part-owner TUI AG of an option to sell any of its holding, in a bid to attract investors spooked by a   from shipping-industry leader A.P.

Shares of Neptune Orient, which gained as much as 8.1 percent earlier, closed up 1 percent at S$1.055, the highest price since May 22. The stock has advanced 26 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent decline in Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index. Neptune Orient,\u00a0Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest container shipper, said Saturday it\u2019s in separate preliminary talks with CMA CGM SA and A.P.

CMA CGM has made a preliminary offer for Neptune Orient and is conducting due diligence, though it hasn\u2019t been granted exclusivity, while discussions with Maersk are less advanced, people with knowledge of the matter said before\u00a0Neptune Orient\u2019s announcement. \u201cNOL is a good asset,\u201d said Rahul Kapoor, a Singapore-based director at Drewry Maritime Services Pvt, a shipping research company. Still, \"it\u2019s unlikely to turn profitable next year. 2016 could be even worse for the shipping industry.\u201d Liners including Neptune Orient have been reducing costs, selling assets and cutting employees to stem years of losses as sluggish global commerce and overcapacity eat into shipping rates.

The firm, through which Prince Alwaleed holds stakes in companies including Citigroup Inc. and Twitter Inc., is considering offerings on the Saudi stock exchange and internationally, Chief Financial Officer Mohammed Fahmy said in an interview in Riyadh. Flynas LLC, the Saudi budget airline in which it holds a 34 percent stake, is among companies planning share sales, he said, declining to identify others. \u201cA significant number of our privately held assets are planning listings starting from 2016 to 2018,\u201d Fahmy said. \u201cThe economic cycle will still be positive and those assets we have invested for a long time will have reached critical mass in terms of profitability and size.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate on the number of assets under consideration for share sales. Kingdom Holding, which owns half of the Savoy hotel in London and is backing a project to build the world\u2019s tallest tower in Jeddah, took an early interest in Twitter and Beijing-based online retailer JD.com Inc. Those investments have yielded an internal rate of return of more than 30 percent and 75 percent respectively since they went public in the U.S. last year, Fahmy said. Alwaleed is   of Four Seasons Holdings Inc. and Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc., he told Bloomberg TV in November 2013. The prince, the world\u2019s 22nd richest man, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, holds a 95 percent stake in the Four Seasons chain with Bill Gates. Fahmy, previously deputy CFO, took over in late 2013 from Shadi Sanbar, who retired after more than eight years with the company. Sanbar still serves as a financial adviser to Alwaleed. In his first year as CFO, Fahmy renegotiated Kingdom Holding\u2019s borrowing in a bid to cut interest costs. The efforts will save it almost $15 million a year in interest expenses on $2.4 billion of debt, he said. In addition to cutting interest costs, Fahmy has also extended the maturity of the company\u2019s loans. Over half of its debt, obtained from banks including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp., Samba and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, now matures after 2018. \u201cWe realized last year that given the strength of our balance sheet and the interest rate environment that there was a unique opportunity to lock in low funding costs for the next few years,\u201d he said. Low interest rates and high levels of liquidity at the regional banks have encouraged borrowers from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates to renegotiate loans. Emaar Properties cut borrowing costs on a $500 million syndicated loan by  , two people with knowledge of the matter said in January, while Dubai Duty Free cut the pricing of a $1.75 billion loan for a second time last August. Kingdom Holding reported a 15 percent increase in profit for the last quarter after the value of its investments rose and financial costs declined. Profit for the quarter was 266 million riyals ($71 million). The shares gained 1.5 percent to 18.38 riyals yesterday. Kingdom Holding, which has $1 billion in bank financing available for new investments, is hunting opportunities worldwide in retail, pharmaceuticals and fast-moving consumer goods, which includes soft drinks and toiletries, Fahmy said. Africa, in particular, is on its radar this year. Pinebridge Investments, the money manager controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li, teamed up with Kingdom Holding on an Africa investment fund last year. The fund will focus on industries including manufacturing, infrastructure and financial services, Kingdom said in June. Prince Alwaleed has also pledged to support his investment in Euro Disney SCA by taking part in a  to raise 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) as the amusement park seeks to cut debt. \u201cOf course we are also always keeping an eye out for the next Twitter or JD, and we have the balance sheet and connections around the world to identify those opportunities,\u201d Fahmy said.

The islands\u2019 municipal government refused to grant the gift shop a license unless it agreed to sell only items branded to the foundation, according to the newspaper.  The shop\u2019s purpose was to help fund the foundation\u2019s operations on the island. An estimated $200,000 in revenue was expected in 2014 until operations were halted, the Economist reported.  Swen Lorenz, the foundation\u2019s chief executive officer, said the dispute needs to be heard by Ecuadorian officials rather than the islands\u2019 local government, and the Economist reported that Ecuador\u2019s ministries of the environment, agriculture and foreign relations have been made aware of the issue.

Puma SE, the German maker of sporting goods and sporting apparel, was sued for trade secret misappropriation by Pairigi Group Ltd., a New York-based company that designs children\u2019s clothing sold under a variety of brand names.  The co-defendant is United Legware Co., a New York-based maker of underwear, socks and tights.  The suit, filed in New York federal court, alleges Puma solicited confidential information from Pairigi and then shared it with United Legware as part of a scheme to bring the manufacturing of children\u2019s apparel under the Puma brand from Pairigi to the hosiery company.  Puma is accused of misrepresenting its intention to renew a license agreement with Pairigi with the aim of \u201cdiverting Parigi\u2019s \u2018\u2018economic and business opportunities\u2019\u2019 to itself. Pairigi also claims that Puma defamed it to companies for which the New York company had previously produced Puma products.

At issue are music recordings made before 1972.  Earlier this month, Beats was sued in California state court by its one-time partner Monster LLC. In that suit, Beats, which sells Beats by Dr. Dre headphones, is accused of using a sham transaction to steal Monster\u2019s technology as well as its distribution chain.  In the new suit, Zenbu seeks compensation from Beats, including extra damages to punish the company. Beats didn\u2019t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suit.

That valuation is double what the company was worth when it   in November 2013. The latest round totals about $400 million, according to one of the individuals, and comes from a group that includes Goldman Sachs Group and an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Spotify continues to raise money as it tries to build a global subscription music service before   or Google Inc., which are both pursuing the same market. Spotify has more than 60 million users, a quarter of whom pay $9.99 for a monthly, ad-free version. Like Pandora Media Inc., a public company valued at $3.55 billion, Spotify pays a large percentage of its revenue to record labels and publishers for the right to license their music. With sales of both CDs and digital downloads in decline, the three major record labels -- Vivendi SA\u2019s Universal Music Group, Sony Corp.\u2019s Sony Music Entertainment and Access Industries\u2019 Warner Music Group -- view streaming as the key to future growth. Though the labels own a stake in Spotify, they have complained about the money they receive from the company and pushed for greater restrictions to its free service. Spotify has resisted those overtures, arguing that an appealing free service is the best way to lure customers who will then subscribe. Listeners must have a subscription to access the full offering on a mobile phone. Music companies aren\u2019t the only ones to complain about Spotify. Singer Taylor Swift pulled her entire song catalog from the service after it refused to restrict her new album, \u201c1989,\u201d to its subscription service. Spotify is about to face a new challenge from Apple, which is revamping the subscription service it acquired in its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics LLC. Apple has asked English indie rock band Florence and the Machine and more than a dozen other artists for exclusive deals to promote its new service, which will cost $9.99 a month and have no free tier. The world\u2019s largest music retailer has bet on streaming as sales from its iTunes store decline. Meanwhile, rapper and executive Jay Z recently unveiled a new version of Tidal, the music streaming service he owns with a number of his peers. Alicia Keys, one of the owners, said in a promotional video that Tidal \u201cputs the power back in the artists\u2019 hands.\u201d Spotify also has been exploring new ways of attracting subscribers, such as podcasts. The company, which hosts some podcast-like audio such as Spanish lessons along with millions of songs, plans to add more non-music programming, according to people not authorized to speak publicly. While the discussions have occurred for several months, there\u2019s no firm plan or introduction date. An expansion into areas such as news or comedy would help Spotify broaden its programming and reduce its reliance on major record labels.","timestamp":1428766054.0,"participant_ids":["3333774Z:LN","9887988Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-11\/spotify-said-to-seek-financing-to-value-music-site-at-8-billion","subject":"Spotify Said to Seek Financing to Value Music Site at $8 Billion"},{"body":" SpiceJet Ltd. is in talks with Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE to buy more than 100 single-aisle jets worth about $11 billion at list prices, in what would be the Indian budget carrier\u2019s largest-ever plane order. The stock rose. The discussions are for Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max aircraft, SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh said in an interview Tuesday at Gurgaon, near New Delhi. A deal could be signed during the current financial year, which ends March 31. Carriers in India and China have ordered hundreds of new aircraft in the past decade as an economic boom encourages people in the world\u2019s two-most populous nations to travel more. India needs 1,600 new planes valued at $205 billion in the next two decades, Boeing forecast last year. SpiceJet shares rose as much as 5.6 percent Wednesday to 28.10 rupees, their highest intraday level in two years. SpiceJet currently flies 18 Boeing 737 jets and has two Airbus planes on wet-lease, but a purchase from Airbus would be its first from the French planemaker. IndiGo, the country\u2019s biggest carrier, and the Indian units of Singapore Airlines Ltd. and AirAsia Bhd. fly only Airbus jets. \u201cWe will bring in some investments at the time of the order,\u201d Singh said, \u201cThe order will depend on what volume level we get at what price,\u201d but it will be for more than 100 planes, he said. Any new investment in SpiceJet probably would take the form of new shares or debt, Chief Financial Officer Kiran Koteshwar said in a separate interview Tuesday. Talks don\u2019t mean a deal ultimately will be concluded. IndiGo signed an initial agreement with Airbus in October 2014 for 250 A320neo planes, in what would have been Airbus\u2019s largest order by number of aircraft. Since then, the terms expired before a final deal was signed. The companies remain in talks, according to IndiGo. SpiceJet, which ran into financial trouble last year and was on the verge of shutting down, was rescued by co-founder and current chairman Singh. Since then, the carrier has posted two consecutive quarters of profit. The airline said Tuesday it posted 718.5 million rupees ($11 million) in net income in the quarter through June, compared to a 1.24 billion rupee loss a year earlier. In March last year, the the carrier made an order for 42 737 Max planes valued at $4.4 billion. The Max is an upgraded version of the single-aisle 737, the world\u2019s most widely flown jetliner, and features new, more-efficient engines. The A320neo is also an upgraded version of Airbus\u2019s best-selling plane.","timestamp":1438132049.0,"participant_ids":["SJET:IN","BA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-07-29\/spicejet-in-talks-with-boeing-airbus-for-11-billion-jet-deal","subject":"SpiceJet in Talks With Boeing, Airbus for $11 Billion Deal"},{"body":" U.K. billionaire Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. posted its first annual profit since 2011 following a two-year revival plan underpinned by collaboration with U.S. shareholder Delta Air Lines Inc. Pretax profit before one-time items was 14.4 million pounds ($22 million) in 2014, compared with a year-earlier loss of 51 million pounds, Crawley, England-based Virgin said today. Revenue at the carrier, which competes with British Airways at London\u2019s Heathrow airport, reached 2.9 billion pounds. The tie-up, after Delta bought a 49 percent stake in June 2013, contributed more than 10 million pounds in \u201cbottom line benefit,\u201d with 4.5 million people using joint venture flights, Chief Executive Officer Craig Kreeger said in an interview. The partnership offers Virgin access to Delta\u2019s network across North America, including more than 40 cities beyond New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant growth in the number of customers connecting onto our airplanes off of Delta airplanes and vice versa,\u201d Kreeger said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to find ways to drive synergies on the cost side and bed in selling, marketing and scheduling. We expect much more benefit in 2015.\u201d The CEO has sought to restore Branson\u2019s best-known brand to profit without hurting its reputation for flashy customer service. The Delta tie-up agreed in December 2012 saw the Atlanta-based airline pay $360 million to acquire a stake in Virgin previously held by Singapore Airlines Ltd. The focus in 2015 will be to deepen work begun last year, including a network revamp announced in September, Kreeger said. Virgin outlined plans to boost connections and frequencies to key U.S. destinations, including a daily service between Heathrow and Detroit, as well as additional San Francisco, New York and Miami flights. Connections to cities including Tokyo and Mumbai were terminated. Virgin and Delta will boost peak trans-Atlantic services to 39 daily flights this summer, including 10 trips between London and New York, the most lucrative travel market. Unit operating costs at Virgin Atlantic were flat year-on-year at constant currencies, with measures including the replacement of out-of-production Airbus Group NV A340s with 16 of the latest Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliners and co-location at key airports helping to drive efficiencies, Kreeger said. Virgin\u2019s load factor, a measure of seat occupancy, was 77.3 percent, while the passenger total was flat at 6.2 million. The carrier is about six to nine months away from making a decision on replacing the Boeing 747-400 jumbos that form the heart of its long-haul leisure fleet, though falling oil prices mean that \u201cthe urgency of that decision is somewhat less,\u201d Kreeger said. \u201cWe\u2019re flying a good airplane for the time.\u201d An order for six Airbus A380 superjumbos is still on hold, with delivery deferred until 2018 at the earliest. \u201cHistorically if you look at where that airplane has been most successful, it\u2019s with big hub operators, which is a bit of stretch for us,\u201d Kreeger said, speaking in a Bloomberg Television interview today. \u201cAs of now, we don\u2019t yet have anything that would suggest it\u2019s the right airplane for us, but being able to keep it as an alternative is one of the things that\u2019s made it very attractive.\u201d","timestamp":1425938460.0,"participant_ids":["2588Z:LN","DAL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-10\/branson-s-virgin-atlantic-returns-to-profit-underpinned-by-delta","subject":"Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic Returns to Profit With Delta Boost"},{"body":" Everyone on Delta Air Lines Inc.\u2019s 11:30 a.m. flight from Los Angeles to the South by Southwest festival on Friday will get expedited security processing, complimentary cocktails and a chance to win first-class tickets to London and New York. Good luck booking a seat. This is an invitation-only junket to Austin, Texas, part of Delta\u2019s bid to grab more of the entertainment industry\u2019s travel business, which the carrier estimates is worth $1 billion a year. The handpicked high-fliers paid $247 each to rub shoulders and share armrests on a new Boeing Co. 737-900ER. Delta\u2019s not identifying the passengers, but when it dispatched a special jetliner to the Sundance Film Festival in February, those on board included actors Kristen Wiig and Emile Hirsch. \u201cIt was a party plane,\u201d said Gary Michael Walters, chief executive officer of Bold Films, a producer of \u201cWhiplash,\u201d the Oscar-winning movie. \u201cIt was very much a club of people who are significant players in the business. To have them all pre-assembled, it jump-started the film festival for me.\u201d Delta, the world\u2019s third-largest airline, runs what it calls its \u201cfestival shuttle\u201d with help from United Talent Agency Inc., whose clients include actors Angelina Jolie and Benedict Cumberbatch. The flight to the South by Southwest music, technology and film festival is intended to show Hollywood there\u2019s a worthy alternative to American Airlines, the world\u2019s No. 1 carrier, and No. 2 United Airlines. \u201cThe whole goal is about going after a really lucrative and very, very large and very, very unique revenue set,\u201d said Ranjan Goswami, a vice president of sales for Delta. Delta hired United Talent to open doors in Hollywood and help decide who to invite to fly. Chris Day, a spokesman for the agency, said the shuttles have showcased the airline and \u201ccreated a valuable halo effect.\u201d The 180 passengers will bypass most airport hassles on Friday, with special check-in and security lanes, and be treated to a pre-flight brunch by the restaurant Lemonade at Los Angeles International Airport. Everyone will receive a subscription to Spotify\u2019s premium music streaming service and a gift from Columbia Sportswear. Amenity kits will be packed with several items, including from the skincare company Malin + Goetz. Wi-fi will be free on board. \u201cImaginative marketing can work,\u201d said Craig Jenks, president of New York-based consulting firm Airline-Aircraft Projects Inc. \u201cDelta sees an opportunity to take market share and they\u2019re taking their shots.\u201d Laura Masvidal, a spokeswoman for American Airlines Group Inc., declined to comment on Delta\u2019s shuttle gambit but suggested in an e-mail the carrier isn\u2019t worried. \u201cAmerican is Hollywood\u2019s preferred airline at LAX,\u201d Masvidal said. \u201cOur employees know how to deliver an elegant, private experience for our most scrupulous customers and have been doing so for decades.\u201d The Forth Worth, Texas-based airline sells the most expensive domestic ticket in the country, for a private front-cabin berth to New York from Los Angeles and San Francisco and back on a specially configured Airbus Group NV A321 jetliner. The price: more than $8,000. That\u2019s a budget-buster for most road warriors but not unheard of for a senior figure in entertainment or media. Los Angeles-New York is the most   domestic route for the U.S. industry. Goswami said Delta has it sights set on getting a bigger piece of it. Delta, based in Atlanta, has been been going after the entertainment and media business in Los Angeles in earnest for two years, Goswami said. Shares of the company rose 79 percent last year. In October, it introduced a new nonstop to London in a partnership with Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.,  and it has since added flights to Vancouver, the Canadian city that\u2019s a favorite of Hollywood studios and where they\u2019ve shot dozens of movies and shows, including \u201cThe Interview\u201d and \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d The steps were the latest \u201ctoward becoming the carrier of choice for Los Angeles\u2019 entertainment and production communities,\u201d Delta boated in a release announcing the moves. \u201cEverything we are doing is centered around earning more of that very, very good quality business,\u201d Goswami said. \u201cThey have productions that are on schedules, they have to have good air travel quality, and we aim to provide that with all the customized services that come with it.\u201d Walters, the producer who took the shuttle to Sundance, called it a \u201cclever\u201d idea and said it made him think twice about his loyalty to JetBlue Airways Corp.\u2019s Mint flights to New York, which were introduced last year and have lie-flat seats. Delta, he said, \u201chas moved up in our consciousness.\u201d Jason Yeh, a senior associate at the venture capital firm Greycroft Partners LLC who\u2019ll be on the plane to Austin, said he could see how the trip might lure frequent fliers. \u201cI think its a great opportunity for them to try to gain market share,\u201d Yeh said, adding that the shuttle was an opportunity for him as well. \u201cShared experiences are what create great relationships.\u201d (An earlier version of this story corrected the spelling of Delta Air Lines.)","timestamp":1426039201.0,"participant_ids":["DAL:US","7532252Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-11\/delta-airlines-woos-hollywood-with-invitation-only-party-plane","subject":"Delta Woos Hollywood Elite With Invite-Only 'Party Plane'"},{"body":" Bombardier Inc. lost the second prospect within a week for its CSeries aircraft after Deutsche Lufthansa AG opted instead for Embraer SA jets to renew the short-haul fleet of its Austrian subsidiary.

Chief executive officers of the three U.S. carriers said they expect the U.S. will open talks with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates over the alleged subsidies, which would violate existing Open Skies agreements. Government aid to the gulf airlines is being used to increase U.S. flights and offer discounted connections through Middle Eastern hubs to win international traffic, the U.S. airlines have said. \u201cI\u2019m highly confident they\u2019ll take action because the evidence is so compelling and it cannot be ignored,\u201d American Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker said at a National Press Club forum in Washington Friday. \u201cWe are concerned there isn\u2019t enough urgency in the process.\u201d Regulators haven\u2019t responded to an April request from the U.S. carriers to block Emirates Airline, Qatar Airways Ltd. and Etihad Airways PJSC from adding more U.S. flights until the issue is resolved. The three airlines will take their cause to Congress if the Obama administration doesn\u2019t limit growth by the gulf carriers, said Delta Chief Executive Officer Richard Anderson. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at it over two years and we\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d he said at the forum. Executives from Delta Air Lines Inc., American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings answered questions about their position after releasing a study they said showed that the Persian Gulf carriers are diverting passengers from the U.S. airlines instead of attracting new travelers. The three gulf carriers repeatedly have denied that they\u2019ve been sustained by $42 billion in government subsidies. \u201cThe gulf carriers have failed to meaningfully stimulate new traffic to and from the United States,\u201d according to a study by economic consultant   released Friday by the Partnership for Open and Fair Skies. \u201cAs a result, the traffic gains enjoyed by the Gulf carriers due to their subsidized expansion to the United States and elsewhere have come at the expense of U.S. and other carriers.\u201d About 11,000 new daily seats were added between the U.S. and Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi from 2008 to 2014, with more than 95 percent from the gulf airlines. At the same time, there was essentially no change in the traffic originating or concluding at either end of those routes, the study said. The head of Qatar, Akbar Al Baker lashed back at criticism earlier this week after meeting with U.S. transportation regulators, calling U.S. airlines \u201c .\u201d The increase in flights by Qatar and other gulf carriers had been in the pipeline for a long time and were not a result of the U.S. carriers\u2019 charges, he said. \u201cThey are being forced to compete,\u201d   general counsel James Callaghan said in an interview. \u201cWhen you compete, your prices go down and, therefore, you attract more passengers.\u201d Etihad said the U.S. carriers received about $64.9 billion in bankruptcy and pension-related aid from the U.S. government, benefits which are generally only available to U.S. carriers and which helped to create a \u201chighly distorted market.\u201d Etihad commissioned research that shows \u201cno evidence whatsoever\u201d of any harm to U.S. counterparts. It is \u201cpatently absurd\u201d to suggest that bankruptcy involves government aid, United Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smisek said. \u201cThe people who paid for those were our fine employees, our creditors and our shareholders.\u201d The U.S. government is accepting comments on the complaints into May.

Is this any way to run an airline? It is for Richard Anderson, who in almost eight years as chief executive officer has taken Delta from bankruptcy to record profits and soaring customer satisfaction rankings. With Delta prospering, the 60-year-old Anderson now is advocating a cause that could cement his legacy -- or tarnish it. Anderson says the rapid U.S. growth of the Persian Gulf airlines stems from billions of dollars in market-distorting subsidies from their governments. He is urging the Obama administration to freeze new flights into the U.S. In this fight, some admirers see Anderson growing into a blunt-speaking industry statesman, a role vacant since American Airlines\u2019 chain-smoking, in-your-face chief Robert Crandall retired in 1998. \u201cRichard Anderson has balls, Bob Crandall has balls,\u201d said former Continental Airlines CEO Gordon Bethune. \u201cBoth of them were not afraid to tell you what they think.\u201d Anderson\u2019s efforts to watchdog the Gulf carriers\u2019 expansion may be his biggest public challenge since he led Delta\u2019s purchase of Northwest Airlines seven years ago -- and his most contentious. The travel and aviation industries are far from united on curbing Persian Gulf flights. Airports and travelers benefit from more service. JetBlue Airways Corp. jumped in this week with a letter to three Cabinet secretaries saying Delta and its peers received \u201cindirect subsidies associated with bankruptcy protection.\u201d In February, executives at FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. joined in writing the same officials to warn against restricting \u201clegitimate competitive opportunities for foreign carriers.\u201d It\u2019s dicey whether Anderson will get help from Washington. Lawmakers will be lobbied by conflicting constituencies while the administration may not want to stir already-muddled Middle East politics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of folks in this country, not in the airline industry obviously, who want to keep those flights coming in,\u201d said Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, who nonetheless said he was concerned about Delta\u2019s allegations. Anderson came to Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. in 2007 after three years at insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc., preceded by 14 years as CEO and other management roles at Northwest. He faced a grim future with an airline just out of bankruptcy and an economy headed into a deep recession. By 2014 Delta reported $2.8 billion in adjusted income and had the highest customer rating among the big three U.S. carriers. Delta\u2019s renaissance coincided with the emergence of the Persian Gulf airlines -- Emirates, Qatar Airways Ltd. and Etihad Airways PJSC -- as industry heavyweights. Since 1998, Emirates has surged to the world\u2019s largest airline by international capacity from No. 30, according to figures compiled by Delta, American and United. Qatar went to 10th from 90th, while Etihad is 13th. It didn\u2019t exist in 1998. Behind that expansion, according to Delta: hidden cash grants, no-interest loans and assumptions of losses on fuel hedging contracts by the governments of the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Delta deployed teams of forensic accountants around the world to investigate the carriers\u2019 finances, turning up what Anderson calls evidence of more than $42 billion in subsidies and other anticompetitive benefits. This violates fair-competition rules in the agreements that govern where and how often Gulf airlines can fly to the U.S., Delta says. It eventually enlisted American and United in its campaign to highlight the alleged violations, and the threesome presented a 55-page report on their findings to the Obama administration in January. \u201cThese are not airlines in the sense that we think about airlines,\u201d Anderson said of the Gulf carriers in a  . \u201cThey\u2019re countries that run airlines. It\u2019s just a department of the oligarchy. And we respect that right. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s got to have some reasonable limitations.\u201d The Gulf carriers say their home nations give them equity investments, not subsidies, and their success comes from modern jets, customer service and Middle Eastern hubs conveniently situated midway between Europe and Asia. \u201cEtihad Airways did not seek this fight; we focus on making money by providing world-class, innovative, re-imagined and value for money product and services to our guests,\u201d the Abu Dhabi-based airline said May 31 in a letter to the Obama administration. No one predicts a quick resolution. The administration is probably deeply conflicted, said Joseph LeBaron, U.S. ambassador to Qatar from 2008 to 2011. The White House\u2019s desire to preserve relationships with U.A.E. and Qatar, important allies in a region where the U.S. has few friends, is balanced against protecting a vital domestic industry, LeBaron said. Yet even sticking up for U.S. workers is more complicated than just favoring the nation\u2019s largest airlines. \u201cIf these Gulf airlines are buying lots of Boeing planes, that\u2019s creating American jobs,\u201d said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington policy group. JetBlue shares customers with the Gulf trio through so-called code-sharing agreements that allow airlines to book passengers on each other\u2019s flights, and it broke ranks with its U.S. peers in their dispute. JetBlue objected to a practice employed by the big three U.S. airlines: forging transatlantic partnerships such as Delta\u2019s tie-up with Air France-KLM Group. Those arrangements let U.S. and European airlines set prices and plan routes with immunity from antitrust concerns. Even before he took on the Gulf carriers directly this year, Anderson was mounting a flank attack. In 2012, Delta lobbied Congress against renewal of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, whose low-interest loans help foreign carriers -- including the Gulf group -- buy Boeing wide-bodies to compete on international routes. Now, with the Ex-Im Bank up for renewal, Anderson\u2019s at it again with a proposal to prevent the financing of long-haul jets for creditworthy airlines. The bank \u201cturned into just essentially a free source for anybody that is not an airline based in the United States, the U.K., Germany or France,\u201d Anderson said. As he takes on a more public role, Anderson\u2019s straight-talking style can give his company a P.R. headache on occasion. His outspokenness is a vestige of his days as a young Texas prosecutor, said former Harris County District Attorney John Holmes, who was once Anderson\u2019s boss. In December, Anderson urged a group of Atlanta business leaders not to be \u201cchicken\u201d about supporting a state tax increase for roads. \u201cThat just rubs a lot of people the wrong way,\u201d said Steve Brown, a self-described conservative county commissioner from Peachtree City, Georgia, home to many Delta employees. In February, Anderson told CNN that it is a \u201cgreat irony\u201d that Gulf carriers would accuse U.S. airlines of getting their own government handouts. Some of the Sept. 11 terrorists who crippled U.S. airlines hailed from the region, Anderson said. Delta later apologized. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said Anderson \u201cshould be ashamed to bring the issue of terrorism to try to cover his inefficiency in running an airline.\u201d In various publications, Al Baker later said Anderson \u201chas no dignity\u201d and is a \u201cweak personality.\u201d Anderson could laugh at his own expense over the issue in March, cracking a wry smile when a reporter mentioned how colorful the Qatari chief is. \u201cHe is,\u201d Anderson chuckled. \u201cI like Akbar.\u201d","timestamp":1433466060.0,"participant_ids":["DAL:US","UPS:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-05\/delta-s-unorthodox-fix-it-man-is-feuding-with-rivals-once-again","subject":"Delta\u2019s Unorthodox Fix-It Man Is Feuding With Rivals Again"},{"body":" Peter Chernin, the former No. 2 in Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, and AT&T Inc. acquired a minority stake in Supergravity Pictures, a year-old company that makes movies featuring stars from YouTube and other websites. Otter Media, a venture between the Chernin Group and AT&T, invested an undisclosed sum in Supergravity, which will use the money to add staff and make films for distribution in theaters and online, according to Supergravity founders Max Benator and Marc Hustvedt. Otter is one of several companies betting that successful producers and stars on YouTube, Vine and Snapchat can make and market films for a fraction of what studios spend. Supergravity will spend anywhere from a few hundred thousand dollars to a few million dollars on a movie, compared with the hundreds of millions Hollywood shells out. Large social-media followings will help the upstarts sell downloads on sites such as Apple Inc.\u2019s iTunes and movie tickets in select theaters. \u201cWith the cost of production coming down and the ability to market with social media, you can produce high-quality content inexpensively, and market and distribute it directly to an online audience,\u201d said Jesse Jacobs, president of the Chernin Group. \u201cThe next great production companies and studios are being built now, and we want to invest in them.\u201d Supergravity, based in Los Angeles, has released one film since Benator and Hustvedt started the company in November, and will put out a second, the supernatural thriller \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d on Friday. Otter and Supergravity will co-produce and co-finance films in the future. Several movies built around online talent are slated for release this year. Supergravity\u2019s \u201cThe Chosen\u201d goes on sale the same day as \u201cSmosh: The Movie,\u201d starring Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla, better known as the comedy duo Smosh.

In 2008, at the first NewFronts, an annual marketing conference, Google Inc.-owned YouTube had the overwhelming majority of the viewership. Hulu LLC launched and Facebook Inc. added videos just the year before. Now, things are different. At this year\u2019s NewFronts, being held April 27-May 7 in New York, 34 companies are promoting online shows and vying for ad dollars. While YouTube retains a healthy lead in the $7.8 billion U.S. market for online video ads, it\u2019s not keeping pace with rivals\u2019 growth. Google\u2019s video service attracted 145 million U.S. personal-computer viewers in February, down slightly from 151 million two years ago, according to researcher ComScore. During that time, No. 2 Facebook\u2019s PC audience grew about 50 percent, to 91 million. Third-place AOL Inc. (67 million) and fourth-place Yahoo! Inc. (52 million) have also gained ground. YouTube is still holding its own on mobile, which makes up about half of its global viewership. \u201cWe are laser focused on audiences,\u201d says Allie Kline, AOL\u2019s chief marketing officer. Facebook and Yahoo declined to comment. \u201cEverybody is sort of gunning for YouTube,\u201d says Paul Verna, an analyst at researcher EMarketer Inc. \u201cA lot of companies are figuring out different ways to get in on that action.\u201d That includes the groups running many of YouTube\u2019s top video networks. TYT Network, which produces popular news series \u201cThe Young Turks,\u201d is increasingly uploading videos to Facebook to grab a bigger chunk of the social network\u2019s 1.5 billion users. Collective Digital Studio, which works with YouTube celebrities Freddie Wong and Harley Morenstein, sells some of its biggest shows on IAC\/InteractiveCorp-owned Vimeo before putting them on YouTube for free. Over the past two years, many of the production companies that reliably crank out hit videos, some now owned by establishment media companies, have spread their wares to other services. A year ago Walt Disney Co. paid $950 million for Maker Studios, which runs YouTube\u2019s third-largest network, and it\u2019s now soliciting ad dollars for shows that may not premiere on YouTube. In September, AT&T Inc. and media holding company the Chernin Group bought No. 2 YouTube network Fullscreen Inc., which recently produced a video series for Snapchat Inc. \u201cThere are a lot of video platforms rising,\u201d says Chad Gutstein, chief executive officer of Machinima, a video network focused on games and so-called nerd culture. YouTube  has created a number of initiatives to reward its creators, and ensure their loyalty. It said on April 8 that it planned to roll out an upscale, ad-free version later this year, and give video creators a piece of subscription fees based on their traffic from paid users. CEO Susan Wojcicki has also pledged to fund series for popular creators, and YouTube announced on Tuesday the first four beneficiaries: the Fine Brothers, Prank versus Prank, Joey Graceffa and Smosh. All of those channels have more than 5 million subscribers. YouTube also unveiled plans to produce movies in collaboration with video network AwesomenessTV, a video maker owned by DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. The movies will premiere on YouTube before anywhere else, which is not true for many videos these days. \u201cYouTube has really stepped up across the board in recognizing the value of its top creators,\u201d says Max Benator, who manages Fine Brothers Entertainment, which runs a popular YouTube channel. He says YouTube stars appreciate the site as a home base, but given that some have TV shows and clothing lines, \u201cthe ecosystem YouTube catalyzed now extends way beyond the platform itself.\u201d Wojcicki led development of the search engine\u2019s ad model. After taking over YouTube last year, she introduced Google Preferred, which guarantees advertisers their spots will play during videos that are among the top 5 percent of YouTube\u2019s most popular. EMarketer estimates that YouTube\u2019s U.S. ad sales will grow 39 percent this year to about $1.6 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s not a finite pie that\u2019s getting carved up,\u201d says Jamie Byrne, director of content commercialization. Reza Izad, CEO of Collective Digital, says YouTube remains essential because the service has viewers ages 18-34 \u201ccoming out of their ears.\u201d YouTube says the total hours viewers spent watching the service via mobile devices rose 50 percent last year. But while Facebook and AOL are strengthening their share of video ad dollars, companies such as Netflix Inc. and HBO may be the bigger threat. EMarketer estimates that U.S. adults will spend about 75 minutes a day watching online video this year. If they spend 53 of those minutes watching an episode of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d that could cut into time for YouTube.","timestamp":1430215200.0,"participant_ids":["FB:US","GOOGL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-28\/rivals-are-gaining-on-youtube","subject":"Rivals Are Gaining on YouTube"},{"body":" It was an unusual delivery at the European Parliament by a pair of native Russians. They broke into the third-floor mailroom and deposited for the 751 legislators English-language copies of \u201cRed Dalia,\u201d a scathing biography of Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, according to a parliamentary probe. The book, published after she accused Vladimir Putin of running a \u201cterrorist state,\u201d alleged that she collaborated with the KGB during the Soviet era. While no link to Putin has been established, critics such as Lithuanian lawmaker Antanas Guoga and defense analyst Jonathan Eyal, say the December episode represents an example of the Russian leader\u2019s mischief-making in Europe. It\u2019s part of a toolkit used by the KGB\u2019s 21st century successors combining propaganda and influence-peddling with more traditional tradecraft, they say. \u201cIn Soviet intelligence, the goal was to destroy the western world and achieve global communism,\u201d Oleg Kalugin, 80, who ran a KGB spy network in the U.S. during the Cold War, said in an interview in Washington, where he\u2019s lived for two decades. \u201cRussia now wants to be a military and economic power, but it has no desire to conquer the world.\u201d Russia\u2019s interests in Brussels, represented by the 64 diplomats at its permanent mission, involve energy policy, pipeline politics and antitrust regulation, in addition to preventing a unified anti-Putin front within the 28-nation bloc and keeping tabs on NATO. In the Brussels intrusion, the Russians gained access to the main part of the   as guests of an employee of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group of anti-EU members of the parliament, according to a confidential report by the legislature\u2019s security directorate, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg. \u201cThis smells very strongly of a Russian smear campaign,\u201d said Joerg Forbrig, a senior program director at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. in Berlin. Officials at Russia\u2019s permanent mission to the EU said they hadn\u2019t heard about the incident and declined to comment further. The EFDD said in a statement the break-in happened without the group\u2019s approval and that and the person responsible is no longer employed by them. The parliament\u2019s press service declined to comment. Four European parties from the far right to the radical left -- France\u2019s National Front, the U.K. Independence Party, the Danish People\u2019s party and Greece\u2019s Syriza -- have expressed sympathy for Putin while finishing first in their national elections to the European Parliament last year. Putin has worked to build bridges to governments in Greece, Cyprus and Hungary. One of Budapest\u2019s lawmakers in the EU Parliament, Bela Kovacs, is accused by Hungarian prosecutors of being a Russian spy, which he denies. \u201cIf you look at almost every far-left or far-right organization in Europe today, the one unifying theme is that they all look up to Mr. Putin as a role model,\u201d Eyal, director of the London-based Royal United Services Institute for defense studies, or RUSI, said in an interview in London. Putin has built an \u201cenormous apparatus\u201d across Europe in part because of the huge sums of money he\u2019s been showering on the spy services, according to Oleg Gordievsky, a former KGB colonel who spied for the U.K. from 1974 to 1985, when he was smuggled into Finland in the trunk of a car. Defense, national security and law enforcement now eat up 34 percent of Russia\u2019s budget, more than double the level in 2010. The share of   that\u2019s black -- authorized but not itemized -- has doubled in the period to 21 percent, or 3.2 trillion rubles ($50 billion), according to the Gaidar Institute, an independent research group in Moscow. With more money and manpower, Russian operatives are becoming increasingly brazen, EU intelligence agencies say. Sweden\u2019s service, SAPO, says that Russia has deployed \u201chundreds\u201d of spies on missions around Europe, including Stockholm, and that they operate across \u201ca series of platforms,\u201d including consulting, media and travel. Sweden is particularly vulnerable because it\u2019s not a member of NATO and so doesn\u2019t share in the alliance\u2019s mutual-defense pact. Russia warned the Scandinavian country against joining NATO in June, saying there\u2019d be military \u201cconsequences.\u201d The country is one of at least six in Europe, along with Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Estonia, that has either arrested or expelled suspected Russian spies in the past 18 months. The Czech Security Information Service, or BIS, said last October that Russia had sent an \u201cextremely high\u201d number of agents to Prague in search of information related to the EU, energy and NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, formed by the U.S. and its allies in 1949 to keep Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in check, in April cut the number of Russian officials accredited to its Brussels headquarters in half, to 30, to limit their spying capabilities. That same month, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, NATO\u2019s top commander, told a Senate hearing that Russia\u2019s covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine underscored \u201ccritical gaps\u201d in Western intelligence. Europe should be alarmed, said Guoga, the Lithuanian  whose complaint sparked the \u201cRed Dalia\u201d probe. \u201cThe Russians have influence on the right and left,\u201d Guoga said in a phone interview. \u201cThey have people everywhere.

The drivers also gathered at Orly airport and in front of main train stations, according to Agence France-Presse.

Still, the tension between licensed taxi drivers and unlicensed drivers at Uber and other applications such as   and   has been rising. Uber drivers have been attacked or threatened with violence. According to Morghad, taxis in France have seen revenues fall between 30 percent and 40 percent in the last two years because of such services. Uber says it has signed up a million users in France -- including 250,000 for UberPop -- in just over three years. France\u2019s leading taxi company, Taxis G7, said it would be unable to take any bookings Thursday. Uber tariffs are likely to jump as they vary depending on demand. An UberPop customer,  , was beaten up by taxi drivers last week-end as he left a club late in the night, using the application after a taxi on strike refused to take him, French newspapers Le Parisien and Le Monde said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to the taxi drivers to enforce the law,\u201d government spokesman Stephane Le Foll said on i-Tele on Wednesday. \u201cUberPop is illegal but let the justice system do its job.\u201d The police in Paris will deploy an \u201cadapted\u201d force to prevent any incidents, a spokesman at Prefecture de Police de Paris said by phone, without elaborating.

VietJet agreed to buy nine current-generation A321s and 21 upgraded A321neos worth $3.6 billion at list prices after negotiations that carried on into the night Monday and were concluded shortly before the order announcement on Tuesday morning, John Leahy, Airbus\u2019s sales chief, said at the Dubai expo. \u201cThis shows it was a real deal,\u201d Leahy said, jabbing at the hoopla over Boeing\u2019s $8 billion sale of 75 single-aisle 737 planes to Jet Airways India Ltd. that it emerged had been on its rival\u2019s books for the best part of two years. Neither manufacturer had much to celebrate by the close of the biennial Dubai event\u2019s third day, with barely $4 billion of new orders unveiled -- excluding Boeing\u2019s Jet deal but factoring in two 777 freighters sold to Abu Dhabi\u2019s Etihad Airways PJSC. That compares with a record $179 billion of jetliner transactions announced at the last show in 2013. Airbus itself coughed up an order\u00a0Monday that had already been declared when it said that British Airways parent IAG SA had agreed to buy 15 A320neos and four twin-aisle A330s. The London-based company had announced the deal last Thursday, three days before the show. VietJet\u2019s purchase also did nothing to disguise the fact that Airbus\u2019s flagship A380 superjumbo is headed for a third year without a new airline customer if Leahy fails to conjure a deal in the next 7 1\/2 weeks. The executive said in Dubai he\u2019s working with two potential buyers on a total of 32 planes, so could still make good on a June pledge to bring in 25 orders this year, though the talks could equally run into 2016. Saudi Arabian Airlines and Royal Air Maroc have said they\u2019re interested in the double-decker. Both Airbus and Boeing are struggling to find buyers after already filling their order books with contracts for a succession of new aircraft models introduced over the past decade. Gulf customers, which dominated previous Dubai shows, have been particularly prominent in racking up huge backlogs. Leading local operator Emirates, the world\u2019s biggest long-haul carrier, is also stalling on follow-on\u00a0A380 orders as it seeks a re-engined version, while\u00a0President\u00a0Tim Clark has declined to decide on Airbus\u2019s latest A350 wide-body until he sees more performance data. Airbus\u2019s order blank in the first two days of the expo was unusual because the Toulouse-based company has traditionally gone out of its way to make a splash at such events, front-loading announcements to make early headlines, schmoozing would-be customers to bring in deals, and even -- according to Boeing -- storing up contracts to maximize the end-of-show tally. Leahy said the general business trend is more important than show-to-show comparisons. Airbus\u2019s\u00a0order backlog spans the next decade and\u00a0Boeing\u2019s eight years, effectively limiting future supply and bolstering prices.","timestamp":1447158620.0,"participant_ids":["AIR:FP","BA:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-11-10\/airbus-swipes-at-boeing-as-a321-deal-staves-off-order-free-dubai","subject":"Airbus Swipes at Boeing as A321 Deal Staves Off Order-Free Dubai"},{"body":" European soccer chief Michel Platini told French newspaper Le Monde that he doesn\u2019t want to be like the former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed Bin Hammam, who was cleared too late to run after having been suspended in 2011. \u201cI\u2019ve been suspended for three months but what irritates me the most is to be put in the same bag as the others,\u201d Platini told the Paris newspaper.

The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Wal-Mart could have done a better job of educating its drivers about the need for sleep. The driver had been awake for 28 hours and worked almost 14 hours at the time of the accident, the investigation found. The Morgan crash sparked a national debate on truck safety, shining a spotlight on one of the most deadly highway-safety issues. The structure of rules designed to limit fatigue has been intensely debated in Congress. Meanwhile, truck-related accidents kill nearly 4,000 people a year. \u201cFatigue cannot be addressed solely by regulations,\u201d NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said in a closing statement. \u201cStrong hours-of-service rules are important. But they cannot govern what employees do on their own time.\u201d Morgan, a former star on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201c30 Rock,\u201d suffered multiple facial fractures, a shattered leg and a traumatic brain injury in the June 7, 2014, accident on the New Jersey Turnpike that caused him to be in a coma for two weeks. His friend, comedian James McNair, was killed. The men\u2019s limo van was almost stopped in traffic in a construction zone when it was   by a tractor-trailer owned by Wal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retailer. There\u2019s a need for better markings at highway work zones for drivers, and injuries among passengers in the van were more severe because none of the occupants wore seat belts, the NTSB said in its probable cause findings released at a meeting in Washington. \u201cHeavy trucks are involved in nearly one in eight fatal crashes,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThis alone demands our attention. In work zones, such as the one in which this crash occurred, one in four fatal crashes involves a heavy truck.\u201d The crash has similarities with other truck accidents and raises broader safety concerns, according to the NTSB. It is one of several high-profile accidents that triggered a national debate about truck safety. The driver\u2019s judgment was impaired by his lack of sleep ahead of the crash. Not only was he nearing the 14-hour federal limit for on-duty time, he had only had four hours when he could have slept in the previous 33 hours, the safety board said. That underscores the need for companies, drivers and their families to understand the factors that go into fatigue to ensure truckers are rested as they begin their shifts, Hart said. \u201cWe recognize the rules regarding what you do on duty don\u2019t affect what you do off-duty,\u201d Hart said. \u201cWhat the driver does off duty is critically important.\u201d Wal-Mart in a statement following the hearing said it was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d that one of its trucks was involved in the crash and had made changes to improve its safety program, noting its fleet is recognized in the industry as one of the safest in the country. The NTSB   that highway regulators had failed to act on more than 100 trucking-related policy recommendations while fatalities have risen the past four years. The truck would have stopped in time to prevent the accident if it hadn\u2019t been speeding in the work zone, NTSB investigator David Rayburn said. The calculation was made based on when the brakes were applied. Investigators estimated it was traveling at 65 miles per hour in an area that was temporarily limited to 45 mph. The Wal-Mart driver, Kevin Roper, missed numerous cues indicating that cars were slowed ahead and the speed limit was lowered, according to investigators. The slowed cars were visible for a half mile ahead, NTSB investigator Dennis Collins said. These are indications that the driver was fatigued, Collins said. The accident occurred at 1 a.m., when the human body craves sleep, he said. Roper was nearing the end of a 14-hour shift, the maximum allowed, when he struck the van, according to the NTSB. He has pleaded not guilty to death by auto and other charges. Investigators were puzzled about why he accepted the final load on his shift because he probably wouldn\u2019t have made it to his destination before reaching the maximum hours he could legally work. Wal-Mart would have allowed him to rest and even paid him for sleeping time, which meant he would have earned more money had he declined, investigator Michael Fox said. \u201cIt really makes no sense at all why this driver accepted this last load,\u201d NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said. He had commuted about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) from his home in Jonesboro, Georgia, to Smyrna, Delaware, before beginning his shift, according to NTSB. Wal-Mart said in its statement it had implemented additional training and education for drivers to reinforce their responsibility to make sure they are fit to drive. It is also in the process of implementing a comprehensive fatigue management plan that takes into account drivers\u2019 commutes. They must now live within 250 miles of where they work or arrive 9 hours in advance of their shifts so they can get adequate rest, according to the company\u2019s website. The safety board has also asked the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to mandate such programs for trucking companies. Morgan in May   a civil lawsuit for an undisclosed amount after claiming Wal-Mart was negligent. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer apologized for its involvement in the crash and said it was \u201ccommitted to doing what\u2019s right\u201d to all involved. The NTSB also found issues with poor emergency response, which prompted a delay in taking victims to a local hospital. It took emergency workers 37 minutes to get the van\u2019s occupants out, according to the NTSB. Some of the injured were moved without appropriate precautions and training was inadequate, investigator Thomas Barth said. New Jersey has no minimum requirement for emergency responder training and certification, Barth said. Sumwalt said a cosmetologist in New Jersey has to have more training than an emergency worker. None of the passengers in Morgan\u2019s van wore seat belts, which may have contributed to the severity of the injuries, according to the NTSB. The van\u2019s driver also wasn\u2019t belted in, the investigation concluded. That increased the severity of the injuries, investigators concluded. The NTSB has investigated numerous accidents in which occupants of buses, vans and limousines haven\u2019t worn seatbelts. The safety board recommended that passengers on these vehicles get pre-trip safety reminders to buckle up. \u201cSeat belts save lives, no matter what type of vehicle we are in and no matter who is driving,\u201d Hart said.","timestamp":1439290810.0,"participant_ids":["WMT:US","WMT:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-11\/ntsb-says-wal-mart-driver-awake-for-28-hours-before-morgan-crash","subject":"Tracy Morgan Crash Blamed on Truck Driver Fatigue, NTSB Says"},{"body":" Paris taxi drivers blocked access to the city\u2019s Roissy and Orly airports as part of a protest against Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s app-based ride service.

John McDonnell organized Corbyn\u2019s successful campaign for the party leadership, which saw the 66-year-old anti-austerity candidate eclipse his rivals to   the role on Saturday with 59.5 percent of the vote. McDonnell favors increasing taxation on businesses, the splitting-up of banks, and a financial-transaction tax. While it wasn\u2019t part of Corbyn\u2019s election program, McDonnell is also a critic of the Bank of England. In 2012, he   for Labour\u2019s first 110 days in power. \u201cIn the first week of a Labour government, democratic control of the major economic decisions would be restored by ending the Bank of England\u2019s control over interest rates,\u201d McDonnell wrote. He went on to propose \u201cbringing the nationalized and subsidized banks under direct control to force them to lend and invest their resources to modernize our economy and put people back to work.\u201d McDonnell told Sky News television Monday that \u201cmy new policies and Jeremy\u2019s have been roundly endorsed by the leadership election, so what I\u2019m going to try and do now is try and convince our colleagues in Parliament of the need for change.\u201d Britain\u2019s \u201ceconomy would be safe in our hands but also be more prosperous,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect that some of the policies will get modified as John McDonnell gets into the job and deals with the practicalities of the situation he\u2019s facing,\u201d one of Labour\u2019s major individual donors, John Mills, told Sky. \u201cIf the British economy is going to thrive and prosper there has to be good relations between the Labour Party and the business community.\u201d It\u2019s not only McDonnell\u2019s economic policies that set a new direction. Representing a seat close to London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, he\u2019s a fierce opponent of its  . \u201cI\u2019ll be arguing against a third runway at Heathrow because of the devastating environment effect,\u201d he told Sky, before excusing himself from further questioning, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve got to go and catch my bus or I\u2019ll be late.\u201d Back in 2003, McDonnell was in the headlines over comments he made at a memorial event for a dead member of the Irish Republican Army, when he argued that there wouldn\u2019t have been a successful peace process in Northern Ireland had it not been for the nationalist paramilitary group\u2019s \u201cbravery\u201d and \u201cbombs and bullets and sacrifice.\u201d Hilary Benn, named by Corbyn as foreign-affairs spokesman, stopped short of supporting McDonnell\u2019s appointment. \u201cThis is the choice Jeremy has made,\u201d Benn told the BBC Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly room for an alternative view on what should happen to the economy.\u201d The new Labour leader was hamstrung by the refusal of many senior party figures to serve under him. Only one of his three leadership rivals, Andy Burnham, agreed to be in his shadow cabinet. He was given the home-affairs brief. Also absent from Corbyn\u2019s team will be McDonnell\u2019s predecessor as finance spokesman, Chris Leslie. While a majority of the new shadow cabinet is female, Corbyn faced criticism for not appointing women to the most senior positions. The two female candidates in the leadership contest, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall, and two  deputy-leadership candidates, Caroline Flint and Stella Creasy, are among the absentees. Corbyn refused to answer questions from journalists on his appointments late on Sunday. To address the concerns, two hours after naming former Treasury minister Angela Eagle as spokeswoman on business, Labour added that she would also stand in for Corbyn at the weekly Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in Parliament when David Cameron is unable to attend. Her twin sister, Maria Eagle, will be defense spokesman. While Corbyn opposes renewing Britain\u2019s Trident nuclear-weapons system, Maria Eagle has backed Trident in votes in Parliament in the past. \u201cWe have delivered a unifying, dynamic, inclusive new shadow cabinet,\u201d Corbyn said in an e-mailed statement. Still, other disagreements remain, with Labour also facing questions on its attitude to the European Union. The previous spokesman on business, Chuka Umunna, is determined to campaign for Britain to remain a member of the trading bloc. In a statement, he said he\u2019d refused to serve under Corbyn after the new leader \u201cmade it clear to me that he does not wholeheartedly share this view.\u201d Benn denied this was an issue. \u201cWe will be campaigning to remain in the EU under all circumstances,\u201d he said. Another prominent lawmaker, Chris Bryant, said in a BBC interview that he turned down the job of defense spokesman as he disagrees with Corbyn \u201cabout quite a lot of defense issues,\u201d though he will have a role as shadow leader of the House of Commons. \u201cLet\u2019s be very honest,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride.\u201d","timestamp":1442201462.0,"participant_ids":["3956452Z:LN","3710Z:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-14\/u-k-labour-names-bank-of-england-opponent-to-treasury-role","subject":"Labour Names Opponent of BOE Independence as Finance Spokesman"},{"body":" If it\u2019s the end of the line for Boeing Co.\u2019s 747 jetliner, nobody told British Airways. The largest operator of the hump-backed icon -- dubbed the Queen of the Skies on its debut in 1970 -- is plumping up seat cushions, hanging fresh curtains and upgrading entertainment systems on 18 planes. Yet competitors can\u2019t seem to park the four-engine aircraft fast enough. Upgrading the best-selling 747-400 version of the jumbo bucks a wave of retirements that have cast doubt on the model\u2019s future, with Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Japan Airlines Co., which once vied with BA for the title of No. 1 operator, ending flights more than three years ago. Demand for the latest 747-8 variant has also faded as airlines prefer leaner twin-jet types. A clue to BA\u2019s lingering love affair with the 747 lies in the model\u2019s ability to eke out capacity from scarce operating slots at its London Heathrow hub at a time when lower fuel prices make retaining older planes an option. The revamped jets, the first of which returns next month from a refit center in Cardiff, Wales, will also get 16 extra business-class seats, aiding deployment on lucrative trans-Atlantic services. \u201cIt makes hard business sense,\u201d JLS Consulting Director John Strickland said. \u201cThese aircraft have a lot of life in them and can be used in very effective commercial ways. Given the capacity constraints at Heathrow and the high demand they have on certain routes, it\u2019s still a very good model.\u201d While BA has parked or scrapped 15 of its oldest 747s, about half its remaining 42 planes were built in the late 1990s, and \u201cought to have a good 10 years of life at least left in them,\u201d said George Ferguson, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. Of the 694 747-400s built between 1988 and 2009, only 266 passenger variants remain in service, down from 362 in 2011, according to analysis of fleet data held by Ascend Worldwide, he said. Most are retired as they approach their mid-20s. Air New Zealand Ltd., ANA Holdings Inc., Malaysia Airlines and Philippine Airlines Inc. have abandoned the 747-400 this decade and Delta Air Lines Inc. will retire its last 13 by 2017. The arrival of Boeing\u2019s 777 in 1995, just six years after the -400\u2019s introduction, marked the start of the jumbo\u2019s slow decline, with its stablemate able to carry almost as many people but with two engines. The latest 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus Group SE A350 are hastening the retreat by combining twin-jet economics with composite materials that offer a 20 percent efficiency saving versus planes far newer than the 747. United Airlines will speed retirement of 21 747s once its first A350s arrive from 2017, said spokeswoman Megan McCarthy. Boeing is also slowing output of the 747-8, the stretched model that replaced the -400, amid weak sales. The backlog for the passenger version stands at just 17 planes after delivery of the last of 19 ordered by Deutsche Lufthansa AG. Air China Ltd. and Korean Air Lines Co. are the only other significant buyers. At British Airways, the revamped 747s will be no shrinking violets, with the jets earmarked for high-frequency destinations including Chicago, Boston and New York, as well as cities such as Lagos, Dubai, Riyadh and Kuwait where the onus is on maximizing seat numbers on one or two daily flights. With fuel costs forecast to fall further amid concern over a slowing Chinese economy, BA\u2019s combination of \u201cmostly-paid-for 747s\u201d and modest spending on \u201csurface treatments\u201d will look more and more attractive versus a bill in excess of $250 million for the latest Boeing and Airbus models, said Robert Mann, an aerospace consultant in Port Washington, New York. The relatively low capital outlay on sprucing up the 747s means BA will be under less pressure to utilize them should the cost and demand landscape change, according to Strickland. \u201cIf things turn sour they can stand any of these aircraft down almost at a moment\u2019s notice knowing there are no expensive capex commitments,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can dip into the availability of these aircraft and not worry that they have an expensive asset that needs to be sweated come what may.\u201d The extra business seats on the revamped 747s will take the total to 86, only 11 fewer than on BA\u2019s Airbus A380s, making it easier to switch between models without crimping availability of high-yield berths. The change pares overall capacity to 275 seats. While that\u2019s 40 percent fewer than on the superjumbo, the A380 is a niche model for the airline, with just 12 orders. BA\u2019s 747 refit parallels the introduction of newly minted planes including the 787-8, the first example of which arrived in 2013 alongside the A380, and larger 787-9, due to enter service in October. Jumbo cabins will be harmonized with the new fleet through common features including Panasonic Corp. swipe-screen entertainment systems with 500 movies and television programs, and matching curtains, carpets and seat covers. British Airways declined to specify how long the upgrade will prolong the 747\u2019s lifespan, though it has said the bigger 787 variants and Airbus\u2019s largest A350 will be used to phase out some jumbos through 2023. Kathryn Doyle, BA\u2019s cabin interiors manager, said the company has no concerns about customer acceptance of a plane whose genesis dates to the mid-1960s. \u201cWe know the aircraft has a special place in the heart of many of our customers,\u201d she said, adding that the Queens have more than earned \u201csome well-deserved TLC.\u201d","timestamp":1440733753.0,"participant_ids":["BA:US","8179618Q:LN","8179618Q:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-28\/boeing-747-dethronement-on-hold-as-british-airways-extends-reign","subject":"British Airways Just Can\u2019t Kick its 747 Habit"},{"body":"Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said it applied for a banking license for its Williams & Glyn Ltd. unit ahead of an initial public offering of the consumer lender next year.

Ex-Deutsche Bank Trader Bittar Says FCA Shames Without Names The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has an approach of \u201cshaming but not naming\u201d traders in penalty notices against banks, denying them the opportunity to rebut allegations about their behavior, a lawyer for an ex-Deutsche Bank AG trader told a London court. Christian Bittar, a former high-profile banker at the German lender, said the FCA failed to properly hide his identity in a multimillion-pound settlement with Deutsche Bank over the Libor-rigging scandal. Deutsche Bank was fined a record $2.5 billion in April by global regulators for manipulating the London interbank offered rate and related interest-rate benchmarks. As part of the settlement, the FCA published a document outlining the wrongdoing, including specific examples of misbehavior by traders and managers, using monikers such as manager A. Bittar claims he could be identified in the notice, in which the agency made \u201cvery severe and very detailed\u201d criticisms of him. The FCA denies readers of the settlement would know the identity of manager B,\u00a0Paul Stanley, an\u00a0FCA lawyer, said.

The government\u2019s determination to force compliance with its \u201cFlorange Law\u201d -- promising extra voting power to those owning stocks for more than two years -- became   last week when it increased its stake in Renault SA to scupper the carmaker\u2019s attempt to avoid making the change. While other big French companies will also try to block the measures at annual meetings starting this week, Bollore has emerged as a supporter. Owner of a 14.5 percent stake in Vivendi SA, the Breton businessman wants to use the double-voting rights to give him greater control over the Paris-based media company. \u201cThe French state believes in long-term shareholding,\u201d Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said in an interview with RTL radio station on April 9. \u201cBollore, in his battle for Vivendi, is going in the same direction and has my full support.\u201d The difficulty for the minister is that Bollore\u2019s enthusiasm for a measure designed to counter investor \u201cshort-termism\u201d and hostile takeovers isn\u2019t shared by all of his fellow business leaders. French shareholder meetings started with Vinci SA on Tuesday, where 99.3 percent of investors voted against double-voting rights. Another 10 CAC 40 Index companies, from  L\u2019Oreal SA and Cap Gemini SA to BNP Paribas SA and Credit Agricole SA, are set to propose extraordinary motions to shareholders to oppose the new obligation. Their opposition reflects a desire to stick to the \u201cone share, one vote\u201d principle preferred by many investment funds, as well as concern from some that the French state could use the measure to increase its meddling in companies where it owns a stake, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Gregory Elders. About half of CAC 40 shares are held by foreign investors. \u201cThe only interest of double voting rights is to allow the taking control of companies without having to own a majority of the shares,\u201d Vinci Chief Executive Officer Xavier Huillard said in an interview on Monday. \u201cYou\u2019re creating two kinds of shareholders,\u201d said Denis Branche, partner and fund manager at Paris-based PhiTrust Active Investors, which owns Vivendi shares and opposes the Florange law. \u201cYou need proportionality between the number of shares and the voting rights.\u201d Moreover, in France only registered shareholders will get the double votes, which Branche said penalized individuals who invest through banks or funds. The government is expected to win its fight with Renault after saying it will increase the state\u2019s stake to 19.7 percent (with 23.2 percent voting rights), ahead of a vote at the carmaker\u2019s annual meeting on April 30. Renault\u2019s motion is to modify its by-laws by instituting the one-share, one-vote principle, but it needs more than two-thirds of shareholder support to block the Florange Law. GDF Suez is set to present a similar motion, though it\u2019s unlikely to succeed as the French state owns 33 percent of the energy company. \u201cMany institutional investors believe that the principle of \u2018one share, one voice\u2019 should be restored even as the Florange law lays down the basis for double-voting rights,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet said in February. \u201cI wanted to allow shareholders to be heard.\u201d International proxy advisers such as ISS as well as French ones such as Proxinvest oppose the measures. PhiTrust has been at the forefront of the investor battle against the legislation, saying it damages the rights of minority shareholders. Its campaign has the backing of 19 investors in countries from Germany to the U.K. and Switzerland that manage 2.3 trillion euros ($2.4 trillion) in assets. Vivendi is one of PhiTrust\u2019s targets, with a resolution to block the change filed ahead of the company\u2019s annual meeting on April 17 and backed by investors including Amundi SA, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management and the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System. Peter Schoenfeld, whose P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP owns about 1 percent of Vivendi and just ended a dispute with Bollore over dividends, said he\u2019d join the billionaire in voting against PhiTrust\u2019s resolution. While France -- fueled by anger about being unable to stop steel furnace closures by ArcelorMittal -- has gone further than most in legislating, double-voting does happen elsewhere in Europe. After an investor rebellion, Italy backtracked recently from a law that would have made it easier to create similar \u201cloyalty shares.\u201d Double-voting was previously an option available to French companies, but the new legislation means it is now the standard practice and boards wanting to stick to \u201cone share, one vote\u201d will have to win shareholder support. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the very few countries to have this kind of rule,\u201d said Hubert Segain, a partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills. \u201cIt\u2019s a power game.

Shares in Societe Generale soared Thursday after profit jumped 17 percent at its retail unit as revenue rose and provisions for bad loans fell.\u00a0That - and a promise to scale back the branch network by 20 percent and spend 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) to develop digital banking - helped the lender overcome a slump in trading to lift net income 28 percent. France\u2019s second-biggest bank after BNP Paribas SA is in talks with unions as it prepares retail-banking job cuts \u201cin the range of thousands,\u201d Deputy Chief Executive Officer Severin Cabannes said in a Bloomberg TV interview. \u201cThe quality of Societe Generale\u2019s retail-banking results is attractive,\u201d said Olivier de Berranger, a fund manager at Financiere de l\u2019Echiquier in Paris, which manages more than 8 billion euros including Societe Generale shares. \u201cSociete Generale is resting on its retail bank\u2019s good performance, when its investment bank disappoints.\u201d Credit Agricole suffered from the comparison, with its stock dropping the most since August after results showed lower revenue at its 1,900-branch LCL network. \u201cTheir bad luck is that the same day they publish results, you have Societe Generale that comes out with above-expectation results and things going in the right direction,\u201d said Karim Bertoni, who helps manage more than $6 billion at Bellevue Asset Management in Switzerland. SocGen\u2019s shares rose 4 percent to 44.15 euros in Paris. Credit Agricole fell 8.3 percent to 10.80 euros. Natixis SA, meanwhile, jumped the most in two-and-a-half years as the company signaled it may buy back stock or boost payouts to shareholders. Low interest rates are weighing on Credit Agricole\u2019s retail businesses. At the LCL network, revenue fell 1.8 percent in the third quarter. Revenue from Credit Agricole\u2019s regional bank network rose, as higher fee income outweighed lower interest income in the quarter. \u201cWe are in a profound mutation of this business,\u201d Credit Agricole Chief Financial Officer Jerome Grivet told analysts on a call. \u201cAll in all, I don\u2019t expect full stabilization of the net banking income of the retail-banking activities before the end of 2016 probably or beginning of 2017.\u201d Credit Agricole, which in recent years has revamped its investment bank and retreated from an international expansion, will present its 2020 plans in March, the bank said. While it\u2019s the third-biggest French lender by market value, it has the largest share of the country\u2019s retail market. The company, a mix of local and regional cooperatives, is trying to reorganize its financial structure under a plan that analysts say may free up capital for shareholders.  At present, the bank owns shares in regional lenders than in turn own most of the bank, which complicates efforts to streamline, investors say. \u201cAt SocGen and BNP, they are more mobile in taking decisions and making strategic choices than Credit Agricole,\u201d de Berranger said. Credit Agricole reported a 15 percent jump in third-quarter profit as higher earnings from its stake in private-equity firm Eurazeo SA offset a decline in trading revenue.  At Societe Generale, net income rose 28 percent to 1.13 billion euros from 882 million euros a year earlier. Revenue at the consumer division climbed 4.2 percent from a year earlier, outpacing BNP Paribas SA\u2019s French retail unit, where sales fell 3 percent in the quarter. The company had solid results \u201cthanks to a good commercial performance and a continued control over costs and risks,\u201d CEO Frederic Oudea said in the statement. \u201cIn phase with the digital revolution which is accelerating in the world of banking, we have decided to go faster and further in the transformation of our retail-banking model in France.\u201d Revenue at Societe Generale\u2019s global markets unit dropped 10 percent to 1.19 billion euros amid volatility following China\u2019s devaluation of the yuan. Revenue from equity trading declined 5.5 percent on lower demand for structured products. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities\u00a0revenue tumbled 23 percent. By contrast, BNP Paribas posted a 6.7 percent increase in revenue from trading in the quarter. Net income at Credit Agricole\u2019s corporate and investment bank fell 2.7 percent to 256 million euros, as trading revenue dropped 12 percent to 374 million euros.

Vivendi acquired a 6.6 percent stake in\u00a0Ubisoft for 140 million euros, and a 6.2 percent holding in\u00a0Gameloft for 19.7 million euros. Ubisoft jumped as much as 14 percent in the French capital, while Gameloft surged as much as 17 percent.  The investments -- which both targets said were unsolicited -- show renewed interest from Vivendi in the video-game industry, after it gradually sold shares in Activision Blizzard Inc. over the past two years to retain only a 5.7 percent stake as of June. Under Chairman Vincent Bollore, who is also the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, Vivendi has accumulated 9 billion euros in cash after disposing of telecommunications assets in countries including France and Brazil -- only to come back to phone companies a few months later. It now owns almost 20 percent of Telecom Italia SpA and ultimately wants to influence its strategy and initiate changes, people familiar with his plans have said. With blockbuster titles like\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed and Rainbow Six, Ubisoft is fighting to woo consumers from market giants Activision and Electronic Arts Inc., each about 10 times its size relative to its 2.7 billion-euro market capitalization.\u00a0Like rivals, it\u2019s been experimenting with alternative revenue sources -- from subscriptions to toys and animated television shows in Ubisoft\u2019s case -- to diversify beyond traditional game console discs.

The French media company with a $10 billion cash pile and run by Chairman Vincent Bollore, a billionaire with an activist investor past, increased its holding in the two developers to more than 10 percent and\u00a0signaled Thursday it may add to the stakes as it expands its content business. Vivendi owns 10.4 percent of Ubisoft and 10.2 percent of Gameloft after spending about 438 million euros ($496 million) in total. Ubisoft and Gameloft, which were created by the Guillemot brothers in France and compete with\u00a0market giants Activision Blizzard Inc. and Electronics Arts Inc., said last week Vivendi\u2019s move is unsolicited. Bollore\u2019s move marks renewed interest from Vivendi in the video-game industry, after it gradually sold shares in Activision Blizzard Inc. over the past two years to retain only a 5.7 percent stake as of June. \u201cThese investments are part of a strategic vision of operational convergence between Vivendi\u2019s content and platforms on one hand and the Ubisoft and Gameloft productions in video games on the other,\u201d Vivendi said. The Paris-based company, whose assets include the French pay-TV station Canal Plus, has also acquired 19.88 percent of Telecom Italia SpA as it seeks more influence in both content creation and distribution. The Guillemots, five brothers who grew up by the seacoast in the western French region of Brittany,\u00a0built their fortune by distributing Atari video games in the 1980s. They branched out into mobile-phone gaming in the early 2000s, and also own computer-accessories company Guillemot Corp. Shares of Ubisoft were little changed at 25.32 euros at 11:22 a.m. in Paris, giving the Montreuil, France-based company a market value of 2.8 billion euros. The stock has gained 67 percent this year. Gameloft, up 35 percent in 2015, rose 2 percent to 4.51 euros for a market value of 383.5 million euros. The Guillemot brothers, who still run the companies, own minority stakes in each. This isn\u2019t the first time an unsolicited investor invites itself into Ubisoft\u2019s capital. About 10 years ago, Electronic Arts had bought about 15 percent and prompted speculation about a takeover, until Ubisoft\u2019s bigger rival sold its stake in 2010. After Vivendi\u2019s first approach, Ubisoft last week said it wants to remain independent. It had said the same years ago about Electronic Arts.

It\u2019s in Yves Guillemot\u2019s office, as the company founder prepares to take on Vivendi SA. This month, Vivendi spent almost $500 million acquiring a 10 percent stake each in Ubisoft and Gameloft SE, a mobile-game developer also created by the Guillemot brothers. Only after the unsolicited approach did Vivendi Chairman Vincent Bollore, the French billionaire who first made a name for himself as an activist investor, get in touch to discuss possible synergies between their businesses, according to\u00a0Guillemot, who is also chief executive officer. \"Either you\u2019re an activist investor and you buy a stake in a company to shake things up, or you\u2019re an industrial partner and you contact us to reach an accord,\"\u00a0the 55-year-old said at Ubisoft\u2019s headquarters outside Paris, where accountants and game designers work alongside rabbit-shaped plush toys and life-sized statues of game characters.\u00a0\"What Vivendi is doing, it shows a lack of respect for what Ubisoft is today and for all our shareholders.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no room\u00a0for old-school methods like Vivendi\u2019s creeping takeover in today\u2019s world of Facebook and Google,\u201d he added.

Guillemot, who together with his brothers owns almost 10 percent of the 2.9 billion-euro company and 16 percent of its voting rights, said he\u2019s working on a defense strategy that could involve bringing in new investors. Preserving the company\u2019s independence is key to landing more industrial alliances, the founder said. Ubisoft has grown its blockbuster franchises, like Assassin\u2019s Creed and Raving Rabbids, from video games to an amusement park in Kuala Lumpur, a cartoon on Nickelodeon and a movie that will star actor Michael Fassbender.\u00a0The company has signed deals with\u00a020th Century Fox, Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. to turn some of its characters and game brands into five films.

This means that the\u00a0FANG\u00a0group has been carrying the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index\u00a0for much of the year, with the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, which strips out the effect of large market capitalizations, in negative territory for the year. A\u00a0rather important question for investors looking ahead to 2016 is\u00a0thus\u00a0whether or not the run in all-powerful FANG stocks will continue. Analysts over at Jefferies are skeptical. Chief Global Equity Strategist Sean Darby and his team\u00a0figure there are three extra questions that can help explain the\u00a0FANG group's recent upward moves and answer the question of whether the stunning run\u00a0will continue into next year. \u00a0 As Dana Lyons,\u00a0partner at J. Lyons Fund Management, put it\u00a0 : \"The median U.S. stock ...\u00a0hit its high for the year in May and is actually down nearly 7 percent [as of Nov. 25].\" Since May, all of the FANG\u00a0stocks are up at least 30 percent.\u00a0 The second question is  To this point, Darby attributes the climb to \"a market that has experienced difficulty in generating sales growth\" for a prolonged period due to falling commodity prices and the strong U.S. dollar. Although it's hard to see commodities or\u00a0the dollar reversing course in dramatic style in 2016, it's also difficult to think they'll be able to\u00a0replicate their recent sizable moves. \"As we have\u00a0noted before, the real trade weighted dollar has never appreciated by more than 15\u00a0percent\u00a0per\u00a0annum. Equally, the price declines in energy have been well over 50\u00a0percent\u00a0from their peak. Lastly,\u00a0European economic numbers are finally improving as demonstrated by robust retail sales,\" Jefferies points out.\u00a0 For\u00a0the third and final question of  ,\u00a0the team at Jefferies believes that investors are going to start moving into other parts of the markets and expanding their portfolios, hinting at an end to the massive run in FANG. \"It will not necessarily be a disappointment in earnings from the FANG or other abbreviation\u00a0but the relative change from stocks that have been discarded,\" Darby and team say. \"It would seem the trend in the leadership stocks is already changing. It is\u00a0interesting to note that cumulative market breadth is beginning to improve just as implied\u00a0correlations are turning higher at the same time as inflation expectations appear to have\u00a0bottomed out. It is time to expand the number of stocks in the portfolio\u00a0rather than narrowing them in our view.\" Despite these worries, Jefferies still recommends buying\u00a0three of the four companies.

An asset-quality review carried out by the ECB resulted in valuation adjustments of 9.2 billion euros for the National Bank of Greece SA, Piraeus Bank SA, Eurobank Ergasias SA and Alpha Bank AE, the Frankfurt-based supervisor said\u00a0Saturday in a statement. The banks\u2019 capital gap amounted to 14.4 billion euros under a simulated stress test scenario, and 4.4 billion euros under baseline macroeconomic assumptions. The four banks will have to submit recapitalization plans to the ECB\u2019s supervisory arm by Nov. 6. \u201cCovering the shortfalls by raising capital would then result in the creation of prudential buffers in the four Greek banks, which will facilitate their capacity to address potential adverse macroeconomic shocks,\u201d the ECB said in the statement, adding that a minimum of 4.4 billion euros, corresponding to the AQR and baseline shortfall, is expected to be covered by private means. The capital shortfall is \u201csignificantly lower than feared,\u201d German Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn said, while U.S. undersecretary for international affairs\u00a0Nathan Sheets said in an interview before the results that the health of the Greek financial system is now \u201cclearly better\u201d than a few months ago. \u201cAlpha expectedly fared best and Piraeus expectedly fared worst,\u201d Paris Mantzavras, analyst at Athens-based Pantelakis Securities wrote in a note to clients after the publication of the results. \u201cCompared to our market estimates for the total capital bill, Eurobank is a positive surprise and National Bank a negative one.\u201d The European Commission said in a statement that it is \u201cencouraged\u201d by the results, while Eurobank\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Fokion Karavias said that the lender\u2019s capital needs under the stress test\u2019s adverse scenario are \u201cfully manageable.\u201d Alpha Bank, in a filing to the stock exchange, said the result \u201cdemonstrates resilience,\u201d despite \u201chigher hurdle rates and the repayment of 940 million euros of state preference shares in 2014, which further improved the quality of capital.\u201d The government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Greece\u2019s European creditors reached a bail-out agreement this summer after months of wrangling that brought the country to the brink of leaving the currency union and resulted in capital controls. Recapitalizing the country\u2019s lenders, after a month-long forced shutdown in July and record deposit bleeding, is the first step to restart the country\u2019s economy, which is still crippled by restrictions on transfers of capital and ATM withdrawals. Lenders will ask their shareholders and bondholders to voluntarily offer to plug any holes identified by the ECB, before resorting to a 25 billion-euro state backstop, according to a bank recapitalization bill which the Greek Parliament approved on Saturday. Taxpayers\u2019 funds will come from euro-area emergency loans under Greece\u2019s latest bailout agreement. Common and preferred stock as well as other financing instruments, including unsecured senior liabilities, can be bailed in before a financial institution is eligible to use the public backstop of the state-owned recapitalization fund to cover its shortfall, according to the bill. Eurobank, Alpha Bank, and Piraeus have already extended swap offers to their bondholders, as they seek to reduce liabilities and boost their capital. A spokesman for the European Stability Mechanism -- the currency union\u2019s crisis loans fund -- said that Greece can \u201cquickly\u201d use 10 billion euros which have been mobilized for Greek bank recapitalizations\u00a0and are currently sitting in a segregated account. With sufficient private-sector participation, the remaining 15 billion euros, which have been earmarked for capital injections under the terms of the bailout, will not be needed, the spokesman added, asking not to be named in line with policy. This will also mean that Greece may not use the full 86 billion euros envisaged back in July. \u201cCapital shortfalls under the baseline scenario, which may be further reduced by the currently ongoing liability management exercises by the Greek banks and the restructuring plans to be submitted to the ECB, are manageable,\u201d analysts at Athens-based Euroxx Securities Vangelis Karanikas and Yiannis Sinapis wrote in a note to clients. \u201cAll Greek banks should be able to cover the AQR and baseline needs through the private sector.\u201d The new recapitalization legislation empowers the state-owned Hellenic Financial Stability Fund to regularly evaluate the management and boards of Greek lenders that seek state aid. Board members in Greek banks must have 10 years of international banking or finance experience, of which three years as board members. At least one board member should have five years or more experience in bad loans management, and three independent board members, who will be presiding over all committees, mustn\u2019t have worked in a Greece-based bank during the past 10 years. Officials who have served in senior political or public-sector posts over the past five years are banned from being appointed board members. No bonuses will be distributed while a lender receives state aid and salaries of management are capped at the level of the annual compensation of the governor of the Bank of Greece, according to the legislation.

Attica Bank, which isn\u2019t considered a systemically significant lender, was assessed by the Bank of Greece, which identified a 1 billion-euro shortfall. The recapitalization bill which was approved Saturday allows HFSF to participate in capital raising actions of smaller banks and not just the four biggest ones. \u201cThe shortfall number was in line with our expectation,\u201d\u00a0Jonas Floriani, a London-based analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe key now will be the capital plans and the recap framework.\u201d","timestamp":1446278262.0,"participant_ids":["TPEIR:GA","ALPHA:GA","EUROB:GA","2539Z:GR"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-31\/greek-banks-must-raise-14-4-billion-euros-after-ecb-stress-test","subject":"Greek Banks Face $15.9 Billion Bill After Economic Debacle"},{"body":"Fiba Holding, owned by billionaire Husnu Ozyegin, is\u00a0considering a bid for HSBC Holding Plc\u2019s unprofitable Turkish business,\u00a0joining ING Groep NV in the running for the unit,\u00a0four people with knowledge of the matter said.

On an October afternoon, it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s exaggerating. Brooks, a thin 25-year-old with thick-framed glasses and an aura of perpetual enthusiasm, has been working for the video game chain since he was 16. When customers walk into the branch he manages on West Chelten Avenue, he can remember what titles they have at home. Brooks tells a cop who\u2019s bored with Destiny to try Shadow of Mordor. He banters with a parking enforcement officer and asks about the younger brother of a teenage customer who\u2019s here to buy a few Skylanders action figures. He nods at a heavyset man whom he knows as \u201cJeff, from the water department\u201d and doesn\u2019t engage him further. \u201cHe\u2019s a loner,\u201d says Brooks, watching Jeff from across the store. \u201cHe wants to look where he looks, and then comes back to you.\u201d After a shift spent glad-handing as though he\u2019s pouring drinks for regulars at a corner watering hole, Brooks often heads home, powers up his own console, and plays online with people he\u2019s met in the store. This is the surprisingly happy face of GameStop, the chain of 6,700 stores worldwide that sell new and used video games. Many outsiders assume the company is doomed. Like music, books, and movies, video games are changing from physical objects that people buy in stores to digital products they download at home\u2014a trend threatening to render all brick-and-mortar retailers obsolete. GameStop, in theory, has even less going for it than bookstores or record shops. Its customers aren\u2019t the type to wax poetic about the musty smell of paper or the tactile pleasures of vinyl. The company is the most heavily shorted stock in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, according to Bloomberg, with more than 40\u00a0percent of its shares borrowed in hopes they will lose value. \u201cThe comparison everyone wants to make is Blockbuster,\u201d says James Hardiman, who covered the stock as an analyst at Longbow Research until November. \u201cThey\u2019ve just been dealt a very difficult hand.\u201d A particularly intense spate of GameStop doomsdayism came with the release of Microsoft\u2019s and Sony\u2019s next-generation consoles in late 2013. The Xbox\u00a0One and PlayStation\u00a04 were rumored to include code that would prevent the use of used games\u2014a potentially devastating blow to GameStop, which gets 27\u00a0percent of its revenue from trade-ins. But gamers revolted, and instead of a death sentence GameStop has gotten a lift from the consoles. Its sales of the devices are growing twice as fast as the industry as a whole, and its sales of their games have risen almost four times as fast.           The surge may not last. After a strong summer, GameStop hired 25,000 temporary workers for the holiday season, a 50\u00a0percent increase from the year before. But in late November the chain reported disappointing earnings and then weak Black Friday sales, and the value of its stock has since declined more than 24\u00a0percent. Paul Raines, its chief executive officer, says the company is used to operating in the face of doubt. The skepticism, he says, comes from people pigeonholing GameStop as a physical retailer when it\u2019s more than that. \u201cWe\u2019re such a complex animal,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no elevator pitch for GameStop.\u201d Raines points to the company\u2019s improbable feat of inserting itself into the market for downloadable game content. No one would ever schlep to a Barnes & Noble to download an e-book, but GameStop claims a 30\u00a0percent to 40\u00a0percent market share in the sale of digitally licensed content, such as extra game levels, and a 10\u00a0percent to 15\u00a0percent share of full-game downloads. Its overall digital business is on track to bring in $830\u00a0million in revenue in its current fiscal year, which ends in January, out of a total $9.6 billion. The chain is able to sell downloads in physical stores in part because many of its younger customers don\u2019t have credit cards, which makes it hard to pay online, and because people want to use the trade-in value of games they\u2019re done playing. GameStop seeks to expand this model to other kinds of secondhand goods, opening stores that sell phones, tablets, and other devices. Thanks to branch managers such as Brooks, GameStop has an impressive handle on the economics and psychology of a market largely made up of males in their teens and 20s. There are few demographics less welcome in the average retail location than young, aimless men, but GameStop encourages them to come in, mill around, and talk to one another. Brooks says this applies even to people who don\u2019t plan on buying anything. \u201cWe have people who shop at Amazon but come in here for the interaction,\u201d he says. \u201cWe say, \u2018Look man, I get paid either way\u2014I\u2019m here to help you.\u2019 That goes a long way.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 GameStop started in the mid-1980s as Babbage\u2019s, a Ross Perot-backed chain of gaming stores in Dallas named after the man who helped invent the computer. The company went public in 1988, then bankrupt in 1996, after not being able to secure financing to stock its stores for the holiday season. It ended up under the control of Barnes & Noble for several years before the bookseller took it public again in 2002. Over time, Babbage\u2019s and its descendants have swallowed a majority of the recognizable brands in video game retailing, most notably through the 2000 acquisition of FuncoLand for $162\u00a0million, which was its entrance into the used-game market, and the $1.5\u00a0billion purchase of EB Games in 2005. The name GameStop was first used in 1999 as the online sales branch of the company. While being a gamer is the main professional qualification for getting a job at a GameStop store\u2014Brooks got hired by hanging out at his local branch and making a nuisance of himself\u2014that\u2019s not true of its C-suite. Raines joined the company in 2008 after 12 years at Home Depot and L.L.\u00a0Bean. (He recently returned to work after undergoing treatment for brain cancer.) President Tony Bartel arrived in 2005 from a multinational that sells cleaning supplies and pet products and once served as the chief financial officer of Pizza Hut. Raines and Bartel acknowledge that GameStop will face major upheaval as gaming moves further online, and the two are focusing on aspects of the business that don\u2019t take place in the stores themselves. There are essentially no competitors left who focus solely on video games. GameStop now vies with Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, and Amazon.com to sell new gaming equipment and software\u2014and more than holds its own. The chain claims to control more than 50\u00a0percent of the market for games designed for PS4 and Xbox\u00a0One. The key to selling new consoles and titles is buying the used versions, Bartel says. More than 30\u00a0percent of the new consoles GameStop has sold were enabled by a trade-in credit, he says. Typically, a customer will bring in a stack of games he\u2019s tired of and use the credit toward a larger purchase. Economically, GameStop benefits from these transactions more than its customers. It offers $12 in cash or $15 credit for Lego The Hobbit, for example (members of a loyalty program get 10\u00a0percent more), and resells the pre-owned game for $38.                   Once a game is sold back to a local GameStop store, it\u2019s shipped to a 180,000-square-foot facility near the company\u2019s headquarters in the Dallas suburbs. The discs are examined, buffed, and reshipped\u2014or destroyed. Some 400,000 games pass through the refurbishment center in a busy week. The facility also employs technicians who disassemble and repair damaged consoles. A boon for GameStop in 2009 was figuring out how to solve the so-called Red Ring of Death, a faulty connection between the chip and motherboard that rendered Xbox\u00a0360 consoles useless. GameStop\u2019s R&D team discovered that the problem could be solved by heating up the top of the device while cooling it from below, reconnecting a damaged chip to the motherboard without ruining it. The fix is now regularly carried out by a $10-per-hour laborer operating a machine that GameStop built itself. A refurbished console can be sold at close to its original price. GameStop\u2019s competitors haven\u2019t been able to replicate its trade-in operation, though they\u2019ve tried. Most recently, Wal-Mart said in March that it would begin buying used games, paying for them with gift cards that can be used for anything in its stores. It said in October that it\u2019s begun selling used games at 1,700 of its 4,300 U.S. stores. \u201cOur goal is to buy used video games for more and ultimately sell pre-owned video games for less,\u201d says Laura Phillips, Wal-Mart\u2019s senior vice president for entertainment. This could squeeze GameStop\u2019s fat margins on used games, which account for 44\u00a0percent of its profit. Over the summer the company made its trade-in policies simpler and more generous. Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, says Wal-Mart isn\u2019t a major threat, because GameStop is exceptionally good at persuading people to choose it as a destination for their used games. \u201cThe trick in used is not demand, it\u2019s supply,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting people to buy used games is easy, because cheap people will buy used stuff. Getting people to trade in games requires a relationship.\u201d At his store in Philadelphia, Brooks says his customers feel the same way about him that they do a trusted car mechanic. This inspires some strange behavior. When Brooks has moved branches, customers find out where he\u2019s gone and start buying games from that store instead, even if it means a longer trip. Then there are the phone calls. Many customers call asking for a specific employee, Brooks says, and refuse to be served by anyone else\u2014even if the question is as simple as \u201cWhat time does the store close?\u201d Brooks occasionally notices a customer trading in a game he knows he didn\u2019t sell to them, and they\u2019ll sheepishly admit another store was having a sale. But he says that\u2019s the exception. \u201cPeople bring in stacks of games, and I\u2019m like, \u2018I sold you all these games,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cNot GameStop. Me personally.\u201d  \u00a0 \u00a0 While GameStop\u2019s relationship with the gaming industry has been fraught at times\u2014Microsoft and Sony don\u2019t see a penny of used game sales\u2014the company is betting its future on proving it can be valuable to console makers and game publishers. About five years ago, Bartel approached Microsoft and Sony with a proposal to cooperate in what seemed like an unnatural area: downloads. At the time, gaming publishers were selling bonus downloadable content such as extra weapons and new characters, but sales were disappointing. Players weren\u2019t used to looking for the items. \u201cWe said to them, \u2018Nobody can find this stuff,\u2019\u2009\u201d Bartel says. He knew where to find a captive audience of gamers who would listen to a sales pitch: \u201cWe have all these people who are standing in line.\u201d                   Today, anyone who buys a new game at GameStop is likely to get a spiel from a sales clerk about these additional features. At game launches, the pitches work 20\u00a0percent to 30\u00a0percent of the time, according to the company, and game publishers and platforms rely on GameStop to push sales for them. Ubisoft, which created the bestsellers Assassin\u2019s Creed and Watch Dogs, said in a recent earnings call that 70\u00a0percent of its sales of \u201cseason passes\u201d of downloadable content in this year\u2019s first quarter took place at a physical retailer. For Microsoft the figure is 40\u00a0percent; Sony says one-third of digital sales come from retail locations. \u201cGameStop wraps its arms around the gamers in a way that someone else hasn\u2019t done yet,\u201d says John Koller, vice president for marketing for Sony\u2019s North American business. This success could be transitory. GameStop has a chance to sell digital content to people who come into stores to buy full games. But when full video games are mostly downloaded directly to a console, many people may decide never to visit the store in the first\u00a0place. There\u2019s currently no such thing as a used version of a downloadable game. Raines and Bartel think that will change, arguing that the industry needs the used trade to keep selling new titles at the customary $60. Consumers are used to getting an effective $20 discount by bringing back games they\u2019ve grown tired of playing. \u201cAll of a sudden you have a situation where publishers can\u2019t charge $60, which we think will be bad for the ecosystem,\u201d Bartel says. \u201cYou don\u2019t see many digital items being sold at a $60 price point. Movies are $5. Songs are 99\u00a2.\u201d                   No other form of digital media has a fully formed secondary market resembling a used trade. A startup called ReDigi attempted one for pre-owned digital music in 2011, but last year a judge said the company was breaking the law. It\u2019s planning to appeal and has continued to operate on a small scale. If gaming publishers who own their copyrights decide they really do need a secondary market, they could choose to allow it. GameStop says it\u2019s discussed the idea with publishers and console manufacturers, but any solution seems far off. GameStop wouldn\u2019t necessarily be guaranteed a role. \u201cIn the unlikely event that a digital buy-sell-trade marketplace is agreed upon, the publishers will likely opt for the PlayStation Store and the Xbox Games Store to cut out the retail margin that GameStop enjoys,\u201d wrote Pachter in a research note in August. The company is hedging against that possibility by expanding beyond gaming and into the used smartphone market. The idea came when Raines and Bruce Kulp, a senior vice president who runs GameStop\u2019s supply chain operation, were making the rounds of Dallas-area stores three years ago. One manager was helping someone decide between two games because he could only afford one, Kulp remembers. The customer had spent most of his money on a new iPod Touch. \u201cIf we have consumers debating how much they have to spend on games, because some of their wallet share is going to another device, we better get into that device,\u201d he says. Since then, about 3\u00a0million mobile devices have passed through the refurbishment center. Most are destined either for GameStop locations or for used-phone shops such as BuyMyTronics and Cricket Wireless. GameStop also sells to wholesalers in Asian markets if it can fetch a better price there. Its technology businesses already account for about 18\u00a0percent of its revenue, and Bartel says he expects the phone business to grow to $1\u00a0billion by 2016. GameStop recently said it would take on $350\u00a0million in new debt to get there.           How successful you think the venture into the phone business will be depends on what you think GameStop is good at. Executives insist that their knowledge of the trade-in business will give them an advantage over the phone carriers, manufacturers, and retailers who have also gotten into phone reselling in the last year or two. But GameStop\u2019s competitive advantage in game retail has been authentic knowledge about a specific market. Gamers like interacting with staffers who actually play video games. Everyone knows how to use a\u00a0smartphone. \u00a0 \u00a0 The crowds start gathering in the early evening of Oct.\u00a06 at GameStop\u2019s Union Square location in New York City. At midnight, the new version of NBA2K15\u2014the premier basketball game for the PS4 and Xbox\u00a0One\u2014is going on sale. From the looks of the scene, a passerby might be confused about whether people are here to buy a basketball video game or to try out for an actual basketball team. There are lots of mesh shorts and hightops, and several men have balls tucked under their arms. A group crowds around a screen to wait their turn to play a demo. Nearby, two men who\u2019d just met share a cigarette and lament that dunking has become too complicated in the game\u2019s more recent\u00a0versions. Almost everyone is planning on walking out of the store at 12:01 a.m. with a physical disc in hand. There are many theories about why this is preferable to a download. Downloads take up space on a hard drive; they can\u2019t be traded in; they don\u2019t look good on a shelf. Besides, you can never really trust the companies that make the games. \u201cIf I have a physical copy, it\u2019s mine,\u201d says Edwin Mensah, a 23-year-old from Flatbush, Brooklyn. \u201cIf it\u2019s the download, they could say I didn\u2019t really buy it.\u201d Andrew Robins, 19, says he suspects that years from now, PlayStation games could be collectibles. He ponders whether the same is true of CDs, but can\u2019t get over the baffling idea that people would want to own music in physical form. It\u2019s so easy to download a song. Of course, says Robins, a downloadable version of NBA2K15 will also become available at midnight. But he\u2019s not ready to take that step. \u201cYou could do all those things with video games,\u201d he says, \u201cbut then you miss out on the whole experience.\u201d","timestamp":1420707442.0,"participant_ids":["GME:US","6758:JP","WMT:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-08\/how-gamestop-eludes-blockbusters-fate-in-the-digital-age","subject":"Extra Lives: Can GameStop Avoid Blockbuster's Fate?"},{"body":" A country accounting for less than 0.4 percent of the world economy is again rattling those responsible for three-quarters of it. Greece topped the list of worries for Group of 20 finance chiefs as they started talks in Istanbul on Monday with calls for the nation and its creditors to strike a new aid deal amid concern its membership of the euro has never been more tenuous. Although global economic growth and Europe\u2019s defenses are stronger than when Greece flirted with exit from the single currency three years ago and financial markets aren\u2019t yet signaling panic, a departure would still come as a shock. That could ultimately trigger a flight from risk by investors, bank runs and another downturn in European demand. \u201cCompromise is clearly going to be needed, but the situation is very serious,\u201d Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver said in an interview in Istanbul. Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said \u201cwhat happens in Greece will have a really big impact on the euro zone and the global economy.\u201d Two weeks since taking power, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras remains on a   with his country\u2019s creditors after rejecting the austerity-oriented terms of its bailout program. While all parties profess to want Greece to remain within the euro, they\u2019re also holding out its departure as a threat. In the U.K., Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a meeting between Treasury and Bank of England officials to discuss the potential impact of Greece parting ways with the euro. \u201cPeople would expect the government to look at a range of contingencies\u201d given the global financial system\u2019s \u201crange of interdependencies,\u201d Cameron\u2019s spokesman Jean-Christophe Gray told reporters in London. Not all are worried. \u201cToday\u2019s financial markets are much more resilient than they were three years ago,\u201d said Roberto Nicastro, general manager of UniCredit SpA. \u201cIt seems there is less concern about potential contagion.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think one should focus on Grexit because that\u2019s the one point that does not solve anything,\u201d said Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. For Greece alone, University of California-Berkeley professor Barry Eichengreen said last month that fallout from a departure would be \u201cLehman squared,\u201d evoking the financial turmoil and recession that followed the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. \u201cMonetary-union breakups are very rare for a reason: they\u2019re a disaster,\u201d said Paul Donovan, a global economist at UBS Group AG in London, who sees a \u201cgood chance\u201d others would follow Greece out of the currency area and that a collapse could prompt a global recession. Donovan and colleagues yesterday published a report warning investors are \u201ccomplacent\u201d about the financial and economic disruption if Greece left. Exit would pose the potential for runs on European banks and an asset sell-off amid questions over the ability of policy makers to make good on promises to protect the region, the report showed. For a start, the loss of Greece would reveal that membership of the euro isn\u2019t irrevocable. That could prompt investors to focus on the markets of the euro area\u2019s weaker countries, such as Cyprus, Ireland, Spain, Portugal -- and perhaps even Italy. At the very least, European countries would end up paying more to borrow on markets and their equities would be tainted, said Charles Collyns, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, who sees a 25 percent chance Greece leaves. Banks would be particularly targeted because they still have exposure to Greek debt and companies whose liabilities would be redenominated in a weaker exchange rate, UBS said. The risk of broader bank runs would increase the more questions were asked about other potential exits after Greece. \u201cThere is a meaningful risk that other countries would join Greece in leaving the euro,\u201d UBS said. \u201cThe euro is patently not an optimal currency union at the moment, which gives economic momentum to the idea of a broader fragmentation.\u201d Euro-area banks could freeze credit, which has already been   since May 2012, especially across borders. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who heads the Financial Stability Board that makes recommendations on international financial rules, said in Istanbul on Monday that he\u2019s concerned about the cost-effectiveness of cross-border banking. The European Central Bank would also be under the gun, according to UBS. President Mario Draghi would struggle to back his 2012 pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro, perhaps ending up as the region\u2019s sole buyer of the government\u2019s paper. All in all, the fallout of Grexit would heap fresh pressure on a euro-area economy that remains weak and where declining consumer prices have raised the prospect of a deflationary spiral. The European Union is responsible for about a fifth of global trade, meaning a slowdown there would be transmitted elsewhere. Investors would also dump any international assets viewed as risky, such as emerging-market debt, according to Collyns, a former U.S. Treasury official. \u201cThis would be a first-magnitude event that would certainly have a major set of stresses across markets,\u201d he said. Although expanding more strongly now than in 2012, the world economy isn\u2019t completely shock-proof. Most major central banks are running short of ammunition with interest rates near zero and balance sheets bloated by past-bond buying. Debt also leaves economies vulnerable. McKinsey & Co.\u2019s research arm   last week that since 2007, the IOUs of governments, companies, households and financial firms in 47 countries has grown by $57 trillion to $199 trillion, a rise equivalent to 17 percentage points of gross domestic product. Fears that the 19-nation euro-area will shrink may still be overstated and a pact to return Greece to aid may soon be forged. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said in Istanbul that \u201ca solution is possible\u201d and that Athens may be able to receive short-term support while negotiations continue. \u201cThis is a Catholic marriage, not just between Greece, but all European countries,\u201d said Turkish billionaire Husnu Ozyegin in an interview on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get in. It\u2019s more difficult to get out.\u201d Some nevertheless say a Greek divorce would be a blessing after years of tension inside the bloc and the throwing of good money after bad. If the Greek economy were to suffer on the outside, those remaining may be more willing to overhaul their economies. Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the BBC in an   broadcast on Sunday that \u201cit\u2019s just a matter of time before everyone recognizes that parting is the best strategy.\u201d The \u201ceuro zone can withstand the loss and will be better after Grexit,\u201d said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors Inc., which oversees about $2.3 billion. \u201cFeeding more to a failed system of governance only exacerbates the final cost.\u201d The world economy is more robust now to survive any aftershocks, with the U.S powering ahead and even Greece has escaped the worst of recession and cut its budget deficit. Europe has the 500 billion-euro European Stability Mechanism and progress has also been made on stress-testing banks and forming a banking union. For the G-20 officials gathering in Istanbul there\u2019s little appetite to test that analysis as they urge Greece and fellow European governments to find common ground. An emergency meeting of euro-area finance ministers is scheduled for Wednesday. \u201cNobody wants Greece to exit, not even the new government,\u201d said China\u2019s Zhu. \u201cAll sides want a strong euro zone.\u201d","timestamp":1423469934.0,"participant_ids":["2539Z:GR","UBSG:VX"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-09\/greece-exit-risk-draws-global-concern-on-warnings-of-lehman-echo","subject":"Greek Risk Draws Global Concern on Lehman Echo Warnings"},{"body":" GameStop Corp., faced with a shrinking core business selling video games, is accelerating its effort to diversify by adding to its stores that offer AT&T Inc. wireless plans and acquiring other technology retail chains. The Grapevine, Texas-based company, which won court approval to take over 163 locations from bankrupt RadioShack Corp., is looking for acquisitions, Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel said in an interview Thursday after reporting fourth-quarter results. The retailer is evolving into a holding company for a variety of store concepts, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring acquisition and partner opportunities that leverage our core competencies,\u201d Bartel said. GameStop is trying to stay ahead of a transition in video games that threatens to make its namesake stores, ubiquitous in malls for more than a decade, obsolete. With new consoles from Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. that don\u2019t require discs, players never have to leave their couch. GameStop executives are pivoting toward stores that sell other products, including AT&T wireless service, phones and Apple Inc. devices. \u201cThey\u2019re basically taking cash flow from games and investing it in this new business,\u201d Edward Williams, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in an interview. \u201cThe ongoing cyclicality of the games business gets somewhat offset by an unrelated industry.\u201d GameStop fell 1.1 percent to $38.36 at the close Friday in New York. On Thursday, the company reported fourth-quarter sales and profit that missed analysts\u2019 estimates, as hardware sales dropped 30 percent and used-games revenue slid 1.7 percent. The company\u2019s forecast for profit in the current fiscal year also fell below expectations. The Technology Brands unit will expand by 350 to 550 stores this year, GameStop said -- its current count is 484 -- while reducing the namesake stores, which sell new and used games and hardware, by about 3 percent. Two of the three current Technology Brands chains offer AT&T products. The biggest, Spring Mobile, is an AT&T reseller with 361 locations. The company also operates 63 Cricket Wireless stores, selling AT&T prepaid plans, and 60 Simply Mac outlets, which offer Apple computers, phones and tablets. GameStop plans to convert as many as 100 of its stores to Technology Brands, Bartel said on a conference call Thursday. It\u2019s looking for similar acquisitions that will fit within GameStop, he said in an interview. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going to see is a significant acceleration of percentage of revenue from non-gaming sources,\u201d Bartel said. By 2019, Technology Brands sales will more than quadruple to $1.46 billion, GameStop executives said on the call. With phones, GameStop is targeting a huge market. At the end of 2014 there were 331 million wireless subscriptions in the U.S., according to estimates from researcher Compass Intelligence. That\u2019s more than one for every man, woman and child. Partnerships with authorized dealers like Spring Mobile help Dallas-based AT&T manage its existing customer base, while focusing on signing up business accounts that pay more. \u201cCorporate stores are becoming more high tech,\u201d Kate Pearce, senior mobility analyst at Compass Intelligence LLC, said in an interview. \u201cTo fund that, they need customers coming in to be high-end customers.\u201d From the outside, it\u2019s difficult to tell a Spring Mobile store apart from an AT&T-owned location. Both are branded AT&T and exclusively sell the carrier\u2019s services and the phones that go with them. GameStop handles the operation of its stores, manages them and staffs them with its employees. \u201cGameStop is a large company with lots of experience in retail,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cFor wireless carriers, retail is a costly business.\u201d GameStop, which operates more than 6,600 stores worldwide, is also using its know-how in the used-product business. Spring Mobile awards store credit for used phones and ships the devices that are turned in to GameStop\u2019s refurbishment center in Dallas, which has long been the backbone of the company\u2019s trade-in used-games business. The refreshed phones are then sold at GameStop, Cricket Wireless and Simply Mac stores. \u201cThe refurbishment element is clearly something they\u2019ve done well within GameStop stores and it may gave them some benefit on the tech brands side,\u201d said Williams, the BMO analyst. \u201cOne way or another, five years from now, GameStop Corp. is going to have a very different look to it.\u201d","timestamp":1427421601.0,"participant_ids":["GME:US","T:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-27\/gamestop-outlines-acquisition-plans-in-push-to-diversify-stores","subject":"GameStop Outlines Acquisition Plans in Push to Diversify"},{"body":" GameStop Corp., the largest U.S. video-game specialty retailer, agreed to buy online merchant Geeknet Inc. in deal valued at about $140 million to add memorabilia that appeals to many of its current customers.

The leader of the U.K. Independence Party is there to kick off his campaign for a seat in the British Parliament in the May 7 general election, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its April issue. Alongside a purple and yellow \u201cJoin the People\u2019s Army\u201d UKIP banner, Farage delivers a jokey, self-deprecating speech laced with acid allusions to what he sees as the great twin threats to British culture and the economy: immigration and the European Union. Farage, a former commodities trader with a smoker\u2019s cough and a horsy grin, has the audience of 150 or so people in his thrall as he rattles off numbers to bolster his point that EU rules allowing the free movement of people across member states have led to the ruin of the British economy. They gasp in disbelief when he tells them that   to 260,000 last year, up from just 17,000 in 1983, when it was \u201cabout the size of two large villages.\u201d \u201cPeople are sick of open-border immigration,\u201d he says to a throng that\u2019s mostly male, mostly over 50, and mostly new to UKIP. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible madness to not have control.\u201d It\u2019s a message that has transformed Farage from gadfly to agenda setter since UKIP   than any other U.K. party in last year\u2019s European Parliament election. He\u2019s forced the governing Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party to come up with their own immigration-control measures. Prime Minister David Cameron, who once wrote off UKIP as \u201ca bunch of fruitcakes, loonies, and closet racists,\u201d has embraced Farage\u2019s central rallying cry, vowing to hold a referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017 if the Tories return to government following the general election. In its election platform, Cameron\u2019s party   to bar immigrants from receiving welfare benefits until they\u2019ve been in the country for four years. Labour says it will hire 1,000 new border guards. In the polls, which show that immigration is the most important issue to voters, UKIP has leapfrogged the Liberal Democrats to become Britain\u2019s No. 3 party. All of this leaves Farage hoping he can be a power broker after the election, since neither the Conservatives nor Labour are in a position to win a majority. Farage\u2019s polemics echo across political battlegrounds on the Continent. After seven years of economic recession and stagnation, anti-immigration, anti-EU parties are on the rise. From the right come parties that, like UKIP, draw strength from anti-immigration sentiment: the Sweden Democrats, the Danish People\u2019s Party, and France\u2019s National Front, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, is seen as a viable contender for president in the 2017 elections. From the left come parties that share UKIP\u2019s hostility to Brussels, big banks, and other forces that seem beyond people\u2019s control: Spain\u2019s Podemos and Greece\u2019s Syriza, whose leader, Alexis Tsipras, became prime minister in January. \u201cAcross Europe, it\u2019s now fairly typical for between 10 to 20 percent of the electorate to back some form of nationalist party,\u201d says Peter Kellner, president of YouGov, a U.K. polling company. \u201cTraditional safe jobs that went with big places of production -- coal mines, shipyards, car factories -- are dying and being replaced by less secure jobs. People blame immigration for a phenomenon that actually has other roots.\u201d Just days before Farage launched his campaign in Ramsgate, he is raging against his pet peeves in enemy territory: Strasbourg, France. Since 1999, Farage has been a member of the European Parliament, which meets in both Brussels and Strasbourg -- an institution that he has simultaneously served in and railed against. The pub-loving UKIP leader has committed to an alcohol-free January, his first in eight years, and he\u2019s fighting the urge for a glass of Bordeaux to accompany his steak frites at Le Cornichon Masque, a favorite haunt. He\u2019s fresh from controversy: Following the January terrorist shootings in and around Paris that killed 17 people, he sparked outrage among mainstream politicians when he spoke in the EU Parliament of a homegrown \u201cfifth column\u201d of Islamic militants bent on taking down \u201cour Judeo-Christian\u201d way of life. Farage, 50, is wearing a new navy-blue silk tie inscribed with the mock Latin phrase \u201cnon illegitimi carborundum\u201d (\u201cdon\u2019t let the bastards grind you down\u201d), a reference to his run-ins with political opponents and the London press. Over lunch, he utters the kind of shock-and-awe statements that rile those who say he\u2019s peddling a dangerous ideology. What\u2019s wrong with hardworking, tax-paying migrants from EU member states in Eastern Europe coming to the U.K.? \u201cWhy don\u2019t we open the doors to the whole of Africa?\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got into a political and economic union with Romania. So you might as well let Africa in as well.\u201d That\u2019s the crux of Farage\u2019s argument: that cheap labor is swamping the U.K., stealing British jobs and depressing  . He says immigration is the cause of a 15 percent drop in real wages since 2008, citing a figure from the 700,000-member GMB union. Farage -- who\u2019s married to a German, Kirsten Mehr, with whom he has two teenage daughters -- says EU immigrants from Eastern Europe are the main culprits in turning Britain into a \u201ccheap-labor economy.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d be quite happy to have a free-movement deal with France and Germany, because wages are roughly similar,\u201d he says. The rebound in the U.K. economy, which expanded 2.7 percent in 2014 after six years of slow or negative growth, has failed to dent Farage\u2019s popularity. During the 12 months through September 2014, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics,   by 42 percent -- to 298,000 -- as workers from across the EU flocked to the fastest-growing economy in Europe. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates there are 670,000 Poles living in the U.K. Farage has played on the economic anxiety of ordinary Brits outside of booming London, which is growing faster than any other U.K. region. Finding fertile ground among people who haven\u2019t benefited from the recovery, he blames the influx of EU migrants for straining welfare and health-care systems already crippled by austerity-led budget cuts. \u201cFarage is a dangerous piece of work,\u201d says Alan Sked, a professor of international history at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Sked, who was a founder of UKIP in 1993, quit the party four years later, citing its lurch to the far right. He says Farage is a racist, a charge Farage vehemently denies. \u201cSometimes I think UKIP is my Frankenstein, that I\u2019ve created a monster,\u201d Sked says. \u201cThey\u2019re a reactionary party trading on prejudice without any rational or intellectual basis. The economy is aided by immigration.\u201d Farage dismisses the many studies that say immigration has been a boon to the U.K. economy. \u201cPretty skinny stuff,\u201d he says, eating his steak. \u201cNone of it prices in the cost of building new primary schools or new roads or extra beds in hospitals.\u201d Yet a   by University College London\u2019s Centre for Research & Analysis of Migration established that from 2001 to 2011, migrants from 10 Eastern European countries (Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007) contributed 12 percent more in taxes than they received in benefits; the figure for migrants from 15 countries in Western Europe was 64 percent. By championing a program to leave the EU, slash taxes, and enact laws to limit immigration, UKIP has turned itself into a British version of the Tea Party in the U.S. In January, YouGov\u2019s Kellner predicted that UKIP would likely win six or so of 650 seats in the May election, while mounting a serious challenge for another 20. Like the Tea Party, UKIP\u2019s clout is greater than its numbers -- and unlike the Tea Party, UKIP supporters have a single charismatic leader to rally around, heightening the party\u2019s power. For months, the Conservatives and Labour have been hovering at about 33 percent each in the polls. The Tories, who are closer to Farage ideologically than Labour is, may need UKIP to prop up the next government if they don\u2019t win an outright majority. Farage says he\u2019s not interested in being part of a formal coalition and will only do a postelection pact with the Conservatives to support key legislation, like the budget, if the Tories push ahead with an EU referendum. With Farage beating the drums, the U.K. may be marching toward a \u201cBrexit,\u201d as it\u2019s known. Poll results vary, suggesting the outcome of a referendum is difficult to predict. A poll conducted by Opinium Research in mid-February for the U.K.\u2019s Observer newspaper showed that 51 percent of respondents would opt to leave the EU, while 49 percent would vote to stay in. At the same time, a YouGov poll published  on Feb. 24 found 45 percent in favor of remaining in the EU and 35 percent wanting out, up from 34 percent in 2012. The prospect of a Brexit has prompted business leaders to speak out. \u201cHaving the U.K. be part of Europe is the best thing for all of us,\u201d Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn told the BBC in January. As much as Farage may appeal to euroskeptic Tories, he\u2019s failed to win the backing of deep-pocketed City of London grandees who have traditionally financed the Conservative Party. Crispin Odey, founder of Odey Asset Management, a $12 billion London hedge fund firm, has given UKIP 26,000 pounds since 2010, according to the U.K. Electoral Commission. But he says he can\u2019t count himself a Farage man and doesn\u2019t think the candidate can effect real change. \u201cSadly, as much as I like him, he\u2019s just not clever enough,\u201d says Odey, who has all but stopped funding the Tories because he thinks Cameron hasn\u2019t taken a hard enough line on the EU, among other things. \u201cDo I think he will storm the palace? No. He\u2019s not a great general but an honest if slightly mad colonel. My gamekeeper will vote UKIP. My clever political friends are not UKIP people.\u201d Farage\u2019s message is seductive in its simplicity. He\u2019s promising to abolish all taxes on anyone earning the minimum wage, or up to 13,500 pounds ($20,800) a year; to decrease tax rates to 35 percent from 40 percent for middle-income earners; and to trim the highest rate to 40 percent, down from 45 percent. In total, UKIP\u2019s proposed tax cuts could cost roughly 20 billion pounds a year -- or about half the U.K. defense budget - - according to James Browne, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies in London. That\u2019s a much bigger tax reduction than any other party is proposing, Browne says. Farage says Britain would be able to afford the cuts by quitting the EU, saving 8 billion pounds a year in membership fees paid to Brussels. He also wants to chop 9 billion pounds from the 11.4-billion-pound foreign aid budget, getting rid of everything except immunization and clean water programs. \u201cTheir figures don\u2019t add up,\u201d says Christopher Snowdon, an economist at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to balance the books by getting out of the EU and cutting foreign aid.\u201d Asked how he\u2019d orchestrate his dream exit from the EU, Farage is hazy. Wouldn\u2019t the U.K. have to renegotiate dozens, if not hundreds, of bilateral trade deals? \u201cNot very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cA few little bits of tidying up.\u201d And yet more than 3 million U.K. jobs and 155 billion pounds in exports -- more than half of Britain\u2019s total -- are tied to the EU\u2019s 27 other member states, according to the U.K. Treasury. Farage\u2019s broad-brush approach to the facts gives euroskeptics like Odey pause. \u201cHe has no mechanism for getting from here to his ivory tower,\u201d Odey says. \u201cHow can we have a referendum if we haven\u2019t thought through the alternative?\u201d Farage\u2019s appeal is much more evident in the parliamentary constituency of South Thanet, where Farage is running. He\u2019s set up his headquarters in Ramsgate, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) east of Canterbury, in an old betting shop across the street from a shuttered exotic-pet store and a tattoo parlor. More than 1,500 people lost their jobs in 2011 when Pfizer closed the R&D site in nearby Sandwich that had developed Viagra. Another 150 jobs disappeared a year ago with the closure of Manston Airport, a former military airbase that more recently operated as a cargo and passenger hub. As the local economy struggles, Farage pins the blame largely on immigrants, even though the number of foreign-born residents in South Thanet is 9 percent, below the national average of 12.4 percent, according to 2011 census   compiled by the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. A UKIP flier making the rounds in South Thanet, about 110 kilometers southeast of London, depicts the nearby white cliffs of Dover on the English Channel wrapped in an announcement: \u201cSorry We\u2019re Full.\u201d It warns that 1 million migrants are expected to reach Britain\u2019s shores every five years. One pamphlet in Farage\u2019s campaign office in Ramsgate is from Christian Soldiers\u2013UKIP. It describes the EU as \u201cthe hidden face of Satanism, a terrifying challenge to democracy and our entire Christian way of life.\u201d Farage says he allows splinter groups to associate themselves with the party \u201cprovided they behave reasonably.\u201d \u201cThey are not officially UKIP,\u201d he adds. Farage says low-wage Eastern Europeans are undercutting British workers in South Thanet and across Britain. Locals say most of the 500 or so employees at Thanet Earth -- which runs the U.K.\u2019s largest greenhouse complex and grows tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers on 89 hectares (220 acres) -- are Poles and other Eastern Europeans. \u201cA lot of British people feel discriminated against in their own country,\u201d Farage says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t speak Polish, no job.\u201d Judy Whittaker, a spokeswoman for Thanet Earth, says she can\u2019t comment on the number of foreign workers employed there, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t recruit on the basis of nationality.\u201d Beneath the low-slung ceiling of the clubhouse at Ramsgate Football Club, Farage presents himself to the crowd as the imperfect everyman. He says he did badly at school, leaving at the age of 18. He was divorced in his 30s, in a serious car crash in his 20s, and in a small-plane crash five years ago. Unlike most \u201ccareer politicians\u201d in Westminster, he says, he\u2019s had his ups and downs and got into politics only because he was fed up with getting what he felt was a raw deal. \u201cWith me, whether you like it or not, what you see is what you get,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean what I say. I say what I mean. I\u2019m not afraid of anybody.\u201d Farage\u2019s campaign stump CV differs a bit from his real-life CV in tone, if nothing else. Like Cameron, Farage attended private school -- Dulwich College in south London -- and is the son of a stockbroker. In the 1980s, he got his start in business working as a commodities trader in London\u2019s financial district at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the now-defunct U.S. investment bank, alongside Michael Spencer, who would go on to found interdealer broker ICAP. In Ramsgate, his Drexel job becomes a job in \u201cthe metal trading industry,\u201d \u201cworking with industry,\u201d buying and selling \u201cthings that go into our cars and washing machines.\u201d A member of the Conservative Party in the 1980s, Farage quit the Tories in 1992 after Conservative Prime Minister John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for a more-integrated European Union. With members of the Anti-Federalist League, which had campaigned against the treaty, Farage helped found UKIP in 1993 to push for the U.K. to exit the EU. Farage isn\u2019t a sure bet in South Thanet. He\u2019s run for parliament as a UKIP candidate in different seats in the last four U.K. elections and lost. This time around may be different. A Survation poll conducted last week put Farage at 39 percent, versus 27 percent for the Conservative candidate, Craig Mackinlay, another founding member of UKIP, who switched to the Tories in 2005 and remains a euroskeptic. Farage, who didn\u2019t start campaigning until January, shuttles between Brussels, Strasbourg, and Kent, juggling his day job as a member of the European Parliament with his dream job as a House of Commons MP. In a sense, Farage has already notched a victory by shifting Britain\u2019s political landscape. If he wins in South Thanet, he\u2019ll rack up another one -- one that could leave the spoiler chortling at those \u201cbastards\u201d on his silk tie.","timestamp":1424988060.0,"participant_ids":["3956452Z:LN","538604Z:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-27\/nigel-farage-roils-u-k-politics-as-anti-immigration-tide-surges","subject":"How a British Tea Party Is Rocking the U.K.'s Political Establishment"},{"body":" Geeknet Inc.\u2019s board determined that a $20-a-share takeover proposal from an undisclosed suitor was superior to an earlier, lower bid from Hot Topic Inc. and gave the teen retailer until Monday to match the offer.

Hot Topic had offered $17.50 a share for Geeknet in a deal the companies said had a $122 million equity value.

The apparel chains managed to navigate a shopping period in which price factored heavily into consumers\u2019 decisions on what to buy and retailers slashed prices to compete. U.S. holiday sales rose 4 percent industrywide, the biggest increase since 2011, according to the National Retail Federation. Gap said in a statement Monday that preliminary fourth-quarter earnings per share were 73 cents to 74 cents. The average of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 68 cents. The Old Navy chain has bolstered the San Francisco-based company\u2019s results in recent months as its low prices and deep discounts lure customers who had been reluctant to spend too much amid the choppy economic recovery. Sales at stores open at least a year and online at the Gap brand slid 6 percent in the quarter. Sales on that basis at Old Navy grew 11 percent. Companywide same-store sales rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 1 percent gain in the same period a year earlier. At the company\u2019s upscale Banana Republic chain, comparable-store sales increased 1 percent, compared with a 3 percent decline a year earlier. Gap shares fell less than 1 percent to $40.78 at the close of trading in New York. The stock rose 7.8 percent last year, compared with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. The company is scheduled to report full fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26. Aeropostale, based in New York, surged 17 percent to $3.08 at the close of trading after saying in a statement Monday that its quarterly per-share loss was 1 cent to 6 cents. That was less than the retailer\u2019s earlier estimate of a loss of 25 cents to 31 cents. Analysts projected a loss of about 28 cents. The teen retailer said sales in the holiday season were better than expected and that it was able to manage margins and expenses in January. Fourth-quarter revenue was about $594.5 million, exceeding analysts\u2019 estimate of $579 million. Aeropostale is expected to report full fourth-quarter results March 12. The retailer also named David Dick as chief financial officer. Dick, previously CFO at bankrupt Delia\u2019s Inc., replaces Marc Miller, who will become chief operating officer. Urban Outfitters Inc. climbed 2 percent to $37.25 in New York today after announcing fourth-quarter sales of $1.01 billion on Monday. That exceeded analysts\u2019 average estimate of $996.4 million. Despite discounts that were deeper than expected, comparable-store sales, which includes online revenue, rose 6 percent in the quarter. Same-store sales at the company\u2019s flagship brand grew 4 percent, while the upscale Anthropologie brand reported a 6 percent increase.

Teen-clothing chains have been hit especially hard by the drop in mall visitors, with younger shoppers looking instead to the Web for fashion inspiration. And while an improving job market and lower gas prices have helped boost U.S. consumer spending, the rebound isn\u2019t yet refilling mall parking lots. The holiday season already saw two clothing chains -- Deb Shops and Delia\u2019s Inc. -- file for bankruptcy, with the latter retailer announcing plans to shut down entirely. Wet Seal Inc. and Body Central Corp., meanwhile, have warned investors that their ability to keep operating is uncertain as cash supplies dwindle. It\u2019s not just clothing merchants suffering either. RadioShack Corp., the almost-century-old electronics chain, has said its status as a going concern is in doubt. \u201cThe big question is, how many malls are there going to be in five years?\u201d Bradley Snyder, executive managing director for Tiger Capital Group, a Boston advisory firm. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a concern for landlords, with the entire sector being impacted.\u201d For apparel sellers, the challenges have been building for years. E-commerce sites and fast-fashion retailers such as Hennes & Mauritz AB are luring away customers. Households also are spending less on clothing and putting more of their budgets toward mobile-phone bills and other expenses. Higher-end stores aren\u2019t immune either. C. Wonder, an upscale clothing and houseware chain with about a dozen U.S. stores, announced plans this week to shut down. Daniela Maron, a spokeswoman for the company, cited \u201cthe highly competitive nature of the current retail environment.\u201d Chris Burch, the ex-husband of designer Tory Burch, had opened the first C. Wonder store in New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood in 2011. The shutdown was previously   by BuzzFeed. \u201cIf you\u2019re an apparel maker, you\u2019re swimming against the tide,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners LLC, a New Canaan, Connecticut-based consulting firm. Cache Inc. and Bebe Stores Inc. have both posted two straight years of deficits, and Aeropostale Inc. lost $141.8 million in its most recent fiscal year. After its losses piled up, Body Central\u2019s cash shrank to just $4.5 million as of November. Wet Seal said last week that it has received a notice of default from a creditor, though it was granted a reprieve until later this month. Stores facing a cash crunch have a few options, none of them easy. They can slash costs, often by closing underperforming locations. They can try to shift more of their business online -- or encourage shoppers to order on the Web and pick up in stores. Or they can file for bankruptcy and try to reorganize. The troubles could lead to thousands of store closings in the next year, according to Snyder. Already, chains are shuttering hundreds of locations as they try to cope with economic shifts. Delia\u2019s is closing 92 stores as part of its liquidation, while Aeropostale closes up to 240 locations of its main brand and all 125 of its P.S. children\u2019s chain. Sears Holdings Corp. continues to shrink its store base as well, closing 235 locations in 2014. RadioShack operates more than 4,000 stores and is seeking to close as many as 1,100. If it files for bankruptcy protection, that number could multiply. Most of the closings will be in malls, Snyder said. While malls with an \u201cA\u201d rating are thriving and can replace lost tenants, only about 30 percent are in that category, according to DJ Busch, an analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, California. Overall sales growth will be sluggish at malls in the next few years, the firm predicts. The teen-focused retailers known as the A\u2019s -- American Eagle Outfitters Inc., Aeropostale and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. - - are paring back their locations. The companies plan to close 14 percent to 28 percent of their store bases in 2015, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jeffrey Langbaum. Non-mall chains are adjusting too. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world\u2019s largest retailer, is focusing on its smaller neighborhood stores and has scaled back its supercenter growth. Best Buy Co., the top chain focused on electronics, has closed big-box locations in favor of its smaller Best Buy Mobile locations. There is certainly plenty of   for the retail industry. The biggest job gains since 1999 and the lowest gasoline prices in five years helped push consumer spending to a better-than-expected 0.6 percent gain in November, according to the Commerce Department. Still, consumers have shifted more of their spending away from clothing, toward categories such as consumer electronics. They\u2019re also diverting more of their discretionary spending toward monthly costs such as mobile-phone bills, Johnson said.

While Serum could never go up for sale, there is a small chance that it could merge with a company like Cipla, Poonawalla told CNBC-TV18 in a broadcast interview. Asked whether there there had been talks with Cipla, Poonawalla said there had been \u201ca little bit,\u201d according to a video clip posted on the television channel\u2019s website. Founded in 1935 by scientist Khwaja Abdul Hamied, Cipla is India\u2019s third-largest pharmaceutical company by market value and made its name selling generic HIV treatments in Africa. The company has made acquisitions in the last two years in Uganda, South Africa and Sri Lanka. Privately held Serum makes vaccines injected into 65 percent of the world\u2019s children, and is   making copies of newer vaccines including Merck & Co.\u2019s Gardasil. The companies struck a distribution agreement for affordable pediatric vaccines in Europe, Cipla said in a statement on Nov. 20. \u201cThat\u2019s a first start,\u201d Poonawalla said in the TV interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning.

Cipla\u2019s Chairman Yusuf Hamied in an interview with Bloomberg News declined to comment on whether there have been merger talks between the companies. \u201cWe are definitely going to have a partnership -- he is too big, and we are too big,\u201d Hamied said, referring to Poonawalla\u2019s Serum. \u201cSo the question is, can we work together?

Serum Institute of India Ltd., which makes vaccines injected in 65 percent of the world\u2019s children, is targeting newer vaccines, including one for the human papillomavirus that could be available in late 2018 and sell at a third of the price of Merck & Co.\u2019s blockbuster Gardasil. Also in development are vaccines for types of severe diarrhea and pneumonia. The version of the HPV vaccine will initially be launched in developing countries and Serum aims to later secure approval for the product in Europe, Suresh Jadhav, executive director of the Indian company, said in an interview. Gardasil is the world\u2019s second-best selling vaccine. Fueled by the invention of advanced new products that command ever higher prices in western markets and a push to increase immunization for polio and measles in developing nations, vaccine sales are growing at double the rate of other pharmaceuticals, according to the World Health Organization. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has also lent urgency to the need for affordable versions of new vaccines for poor countries. The global market for vaccines has more than tripled to $25.5 billion from $7.4 billion in 2005, estimates Kalorama Information, a publisher of market research. The world\u2019s biggest drugmakers -- including Merck, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Sanofi and Pfizer Inc. -- dominate the market because of the heavy investments needed to develop vaccines and the high failure rate of potential candidates. Unicef procures their vaccines cheaply for the governments of the world\u2019s poorest countries, some on behalf of the Geneva-based GAVI Alliance, a charity that is the biggest provider of money for vaccines sent to developing countries. In 2013, Unicef procured doses of vaccines for 100 countries, at prices that drug companies say represent their costs. Closely held Serum can undercut those prices because the Pune, India-based company has lower costs of production. \u201cThis will result in creating much wider market access to HPV vaccines,\u201d said Jayant Singh, director of the healthcare practice at Frost & Sullivan in New Delhi, referring to the Indian company\u2019s planned product. Most cervical cancers are caused by HPV, and the World Health Organization has recommended universal use of vaccines against the virus, creating an opening for vaccine makers in India and China to come up with cheaper alternatives. Xiamen Innovax Biotech Co., a pharma company based in southeast China, says it is working on an HPV vaccine against two strains of the virus. Cervical cancer is   for more than 270,000 deaths annually, 85 percent of which occur in developing countries, according to the WHO. Merck earned $1.8 billion from sales of Gardasil in 2013, driven by approvals for use among boys, purchases for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control vaccine stockpiles and emerging market demand. Boys are vaccinated against HPV as a precaution against oral and anal cancer, which can be caused by the same virus. Serum says it will intially run clinical trials in India and Africa for its alternative to Gardasil, and the first phase will start this year. Like Gardasil it would protect against four strains of HPV. London-based Glaxo also has an HPV vaccine called Cervarix, which protects against two strains. Glaxo via email said that each year around 80 percent of its vaccines, including Cervarix, go to developing countries at discounted prices. Gardasil   the U.S. Centers for Disease Control $113.54 per dose. Unicef\u2019s website shows it has a contract to buy Gardasil from Merck at $4.50 a dose this year. While Serum hasn\u2019t yet agreed to a price, \u201cit will be extremely affordable so that even the poorest of the poor countries can introduce it in their programs,\u201d Jadhav said. \u201cWe are looking at at least about one-third the price that it is currently being procured at by the UN agency.\u201d The presence of low-cost alternatives to Merck and Glaxo\u2019s vaccine may encourage developing countries to add HPV immunization to their routine schedules, creating a bigger market for all the manufacturers and eventually benefitting Merck and Glaxo, said Singh. Merck said it is \u201cpremature\u201d to talk of HPV vaccines under development. Low-cost HPV vaccines targeted at 53 low-income countries that are under a tie-up with GAVI wouldn\u2019t impact the company\u2019s income as it has already committed to no-profit pricing for Gardasil in those nations, Merck said in an e-mailed response to questions. Getting copies of Gardasil approved in Europe as interchangeable with Merck\u2019s version will be challenging, if not impossible, said Richard Purkiss, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP in London. In many European Union countries, automatic substitution of biologics, or products like vaccines that are derived from living organisms, is prohibited or not recommended. Serum has also been building its line-up of other vaccines. A vaccine it developed to target meningitis A in sub-Saharan Africa was this month approved for use in infants under one. It plans to sell a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine at $2 to $2.50 a dose to Unicef that will be available by the first quarter of 2018, Jadhav said. Unicef has agreed to pay Merck up to $5 per dose this year for the U.S. company\u2019s RotaTeq vaccine. The virus can cause severe diarrhea. Serum also has under development a pneumococcal vaccine which will be much cheaper than what it is procured at now and will be introduced by the first quarter of 2019. The product would compete with Glaxo\u2019s Synflorix, which Unicef has agreed to purchase this year for up to $7 a dose.","timestamp":1422280801.0,"participant_ids":["1016055D:US","7173113Z:IN","GSK:LN"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-26\/top-selling-vaccine-made-cheap-shows-challenge-to-merck-health","subject":"Top-Selling Vaccine Made Cheap Shows Challenge to Merck: Health"},{"body":" Serum Institute of India Ltd., Asia\u2019s largest vaccine maker, will look at a possible merger with generic drugmaker Cipla Ltd. if the European venture between the two companies succeeds.

We also note how the commission, in its three-year review, sidestepped the controversial issue of venue, or where a company can file Chapter 11. The group also deferred recommending modifications in Chapter 11 for individuals. Our review of the December ABI report closes with a look at so-called structured dismissals.  Excluding those people who can be forced into Chapter 11 because they don\u2019t qualify for either Chapter 13 or Chapter 7, 85 percent to 90 percent of companies filing in Chapter 11 have $10 million or less in assets or debt, the ABI commission calculated. The commission refers to them as small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs.  The report explains how existing Chapter 11 law, designed with large companies in mind and last comprehensively overhauled in 1978, is too slow, too costly and \u201cnot working\u201d for SMEs, dissuading them from even attempting reorganization.  The commission recommended that Congress make any $10 million company automatically eligible for treatment as an SME, while one with less than $50 million in assets or debt could petition the court for SME treatment. Companies with publicly traded securities and individuals wouldn\u2019t qualify.  The commission set out ways to make Chapter 11 simpler and less costly for SMEs while providing tools for them to reorganize effectively.  For starters, an unaudited SME could use good-faith valuation estimates. Further reducing costs, there ordinarily wouldn\u2019t be an official creditors\u2019 committee, although the court could appoint a so-called estate neutral to help the SME formulate a plan. Click here for the Dec. 30 Bloomberg bankruptcy report and discussion of the estate neutral.  The commission would repeal existing provisions in the Bankruptcy Code that require a small business to complete its reorganization within 300 days of the Chapter 11 filing, and get its plan confirmed at most 45 days after presenting it to the court. Those deadlines are often impossible to meet, the panel said.  Instead, the ABI commission advocated letting the SME propose a time line for plan submission within two months of its Chapter 11 filing, subject to a judge\u2019s approval.  So-called absolute priority rules don\u2019t work well with SMEs because they require wiping out shareholdings if even one creditor class votes against a plan. The commissioners proposed allowing existing shareholders to retain ownership, as long as creditors are fully paid within four years of the company\u2019s emergence from Chapter 11.  If all creditor classes vote for a plan, existing shareholders retain their stock. If there isn\u2019t universal acceptance, pre-bankruptcy owners can keep 100 percent of the common stock, with the right to receive only 15 percent of \u201ceconomic distributions.\u201d  Unsecured creditors would get 100 percent of the preferred stock and the right to receive 85 percent of economic distributions.  If creditors aren\u2019t paid in full on their pre-bankruptcy claims within four years, their preferred stock converts into 85 percent of the common stock.  Venue is one of the most controversial aspects of contemporary bankruptcy practice, because companies can file in any jurisdiction where even a single affiliate is incorporated or does business. Most large Chapter 11 cases are therefore filed in Delaware or New York, often thousands of miles away from the company\u2019s headquarters and creditors.  Saying they couldn\u2019t reach a consensus on venue rules, \u201cthe most difficult and divisive issue considered,\u201d the commissioners made no recommendations.  The panel also made no recommendations on Chapter 11 for individuals. That issue is the subject of a separate ABI study.  Structured dismissals are another major source of controversy. A structured dismissal ordinarily occurs when assets are sold and there isn\u2019t enough left after paying secured creditors to cover expenses of the Chapter 11 effort and confirm a liquidation plan for unsecured creditors.  In those situations, there are sometimes settlements carving out money for unsecured creditors, even though Chapter 11 expenses go unpaid. Third parties might also be given releases from potential lawsuits.  In light of the ABI\u2019s recommendations for asset sales and so-called third-party releases, the commission in substance would ban structured dismissals by requiring companies to adhere to provisions laid out in Section 349 of the code, under which property returns to the bankrupt company on dismissal and any transactions set aside during bankruptcy are returned to the status quo ante.  For a discussion of the recommendations regarding sales, click here for the Jan. 8 Bloomberg bankruptcy report.  Body Central Corp., a 265-stores women\u2019s-ware retailer, is attempting to liquidate in Florida state court rather than through a Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 filing in federal bankruptcy court.  After reports it was planning a bankruptcy filing, the Jacksonville, Florida-based retailer announced on Jan. 9 that it made a so-called assignment for the benefit of creditors under state law, where Mark Healy from Michael Moecker & Associates takes over, liquidates the assets, and makes distributions to creditors.  The stores in 28 states were to close at the end of this past weekend, a company lawyer told Bloomberg News. Body Central caters to women from their teen years through mid-30s.  An assignment for creditors in substance is a consensual process usually used, if at all, by companies much smaller than Body Central. Compared with bankruptcy, an assignment for creditors doesn\u2019t halt all creditor actions because state courts, unlike federal courts, can\u2019t modify contractual rights.  Body Central said it didn\u2019t attempt to reorganize because it couldn\u2019t arrange financing.  It remains to be seen whether creditors will file an involuntary bankruptcy petition intending to halt the state-court assignment.  Outside of bankruptcy court, suppliers can sue and exercise so-called reclamation rights to take back recently-delivered merchandise. Also, state courts don\u2019t have equal power to override state law restricting going-out-of-business sales. State proceedings may not be able to sell store leases with the same facility as bankruptcy court.  On the other hand, state-court assignments are considered cheaper and quicker than bankruptcy. In that regard, see the item in today\u2019s report on the American Bankruptcy Institute report which advocates making Chapter 11 more hospitable for smaller companies.  For other Bloomberg coverage, click here.  Body Central announced the assignment for creditors after saying that Crystal Finance LLC had shut off access to a $17 million credit. There was nothing owing to Crystal, according to Body Central. Crystal acted Body Central got a notice of default on $18 million in subordinated secured convertible notes issued in June.  Body Central reported a $55.3 million operating loss over the first three quarters of 2014 on revenue of $159.6 million. The net loss in the period was $47 million.  The Sept. 27 balance sheet had assets of $76.1 million against debt totaling $61.5 million.  Body Central\u2019s stock last sold on Jan. 9 for 18 cents in over the counter trading. Adjusted for splits, the high for the stock was over $300 a share in April 2012.  Samuel Wyly, the estate of his late brother Charles, and Charles\u2019 widow Caroline Wyly got good news at the end of last week U.S. District Court in New York and bad news in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas.  As the result of a ruling in district court in December, the Securities and Exchange Commission calculates that Samuel and Charles\u2019 estate is liable for no more than $175 million for using offshore accounts in violation of securities laws by secretly trading in securities of companies where they were on the board.  The SEC had wanted District Judge Shira Scheindlin to find them collectively liable for $493 million.  Meanwhile, Bankruptcy Judge Barbara Houser in Dallas handed down an opinion on Jan. 9 concluding that Caroline\u2019s bankruptcy didn\u2019t bar the SEC from filing a lawsuit in Scheindlin\u2019s court designed eventually to collect a judgment against Samuel and Charles\u2019 estate.  After a jury trial, Scheindlin tentatively ruled in September that the brothers could be liable for $123.8 million and $63.4 million, respectively, representing taxes they avoided by trading in the secret accounts, plus interest. Samuel responded by filing for Chapter 11 protection in October in Houser\u2019s court. Caroline followed four days later with her own Chapter 11 petition.  Caroline had not been a defendant in Scheindlin\u2019s court because the SEC doesn\u2019t claim she violated securities laws. At the end of October, however, the SEC amended its complaint to add Caroline and other Wyly family members as so-called relief defendants who allegedly are in possession of some of the brothers\u2019 ill-gotten gains.  The SEC contends that Caroline and other family members have no valid claim to the monies they received from the brothers and can be compelled to turn it over to the government.  Caroline filed papers asking Houser to decide whether naming her as a relief defendant violated the so-called automatic stay arising from her bankruptcy. The SEC responded by saying the automatic stay didn\u2019t apply because the government was enforcing police or regulatory powers.  Houser agreed with the government in her opinion at the end of last week. Scheindlin gave Houser responsibility for deciding the automatic stay question.  Finding only three cases that address the issue, and none of them binding on her, Houser said that seeking disgorgement from a relief defendant is enforcement of public policy, because no one can legitimately claim proceeds of wrongdoing received as gifts.  Even if the automatic stay did apply, Houser said the SEC might be entitled to modify the stay in the interest of judicial economy, because Caroline\u2019s liability is tied up with liability of the two brothers and other family members.  The SEC admits that it can\u2019t automatically collect a judgment it gets from Scheindlin against Caroline. The government knows it can only collect a judgment in Caroline\u2019s bankruptcy.  At the end of this week, the two brothers can file papers telling Scheindlin their liability should be less than the $175 million calculated by the government.  Once Scheindlin enters judgment, the SEC came appeal, contending that Scheindlin erred by requiring no disgorgement on 38 percent of the brothers\u2019 gains on securities that were never sold. The SEC can also appeal, saying it was a mistake for Scheindlin to cut off pre-judgment interest as of February 2005.

Also last week Houser authorized Samuel to sell a bookstore and the building in Aspen, Colorado where it operates for $5 million.  Scheindlin froze the assets of the Wylys and other family members as part of the SEC suit. She\u2019s letting them use whatever cash the bankruptcy judge allows in monthly budgets.  The bankruptcy is In re Samuel E. Wyly, 14-bk-35043, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas). The SEC lawsuit is SEC v. Wyly, 10-cv-05760, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  Kior Inc. and lenders who aim to take ownership through a pending reorganization plan asked the bankruptcy court in Delaware to rebuff an attempt by the Mississippi Development Authority to dismiss or convert the case to a Chapter 7 liquidation.  Kior is working on a process to make motor fuel from plant material. The development-stage company was founded in 2007 as a joint venture including Khosla Ventures LLC. Vinod Khosla is a founder of Sun Microsystems.  The sole motivation of Mississippi is to destroy any going-concern value of Kior, the company said in a Jan. 8 court filing.  Dismissal or conversion advances no legitimate business interest and wouldn\u2019t create value or provide any recovery for the development authority\u2019s unsecured claim, according to Kior.  The authority\u2019s motion, scheduled for consideration at a Jan. 15 hearing, is a continuation of its \u201chyper-aggressive litigation scheme\u201d to cause interference and extract value to which it would not otherwise be entitled, Kior said.  The so-called Khosla parties, who would end up owning the reorganized company through a debt-for-equity transaction embodied in the proposed Chapter 11 plan, agreed that the MDA\u2019s motion is simply a litigation strategy.  The authority is \u201cjust wrong\u201d when it suggests that the Khosla parties are exercising untoward influence over Kior or that the bankruptcy case is being used as a vehicle for some illicit purpose, the parties said in a Jan. 8 court filing.  The purpose of bankruptcy is to preserve Kior\u2019s ground-breaking technology and reset its capital structure, according to the Khosla parties.  The so-called stalking-horse bidder, comprising secured lenders including Khosla Ventures III LP, agreed at the outset of the case to consummate a comprehensive restructuring. Competing bids were due Jan. 7. Kior didn\u2019t receive any other qualified bids by the deadline and canceled the auction, according to a court filing.  At a hearing scheduled for Jan. 23, Kior will seek approval of disclosure materials explaining its Chapter 11 plan. It provides for conversion of senior debt to 100 percent of the new equity in the reorganized company.  The Pasadena, Texas-based company owed $16.3 million to first-lien lenders, $106.1 million on two issues of second-lien debt, and $115 million to third-lien creditors as of the Nov. 9 bankruptcy filing. The lenders include Alberta Investment Management Corp., owed about $77 million, and Khosla Ventures and other lenders with claims for approximately $159 million.  Kior\u2019s non-operating plant in Columbus, Mississippi, isn\u2019t in bankruptcy, according to court papers. The Kior entities reported consolidated assets of $58.3 million and liabilities of $261.3 million as of June 30.  The case is In re Kior Inc., 14-bk-12514, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  After Aereo Inc. met with opposition at a hearing last month where it was seeking approval of an executive bonus program, the one-time online TV streaming service responded by raising the potential bonuses by 45 percent.  Not persuaded that the changes turned the proposal into a bona fide incentive plan, the U.S. Trustee filed another objection. A bankruptcy judge in Manhattan will sort out the issue at a Jan. 13 hearing.  Originally, Aereo wanted to create a maximum bonus pool of $940,000, from which key executives would get as much as 3 percent of sale proceeds or 50 percent of base salary, whichever is less. Under the modified program, the pool was increased to $1.36 million, with managers eligible for the lesser of 5 percent of sale proceeds or 75 percent of a year\u2019s salary.  The program\u2019 bonuses kick in only if sale proceeds reach at least $4 million. The original program had no floor.  The U.S. Trustee, the Justice Department\u2019s bankruptcy watchdog, said in a court filing last week that the new proposal continues \u201cto bear the footprints of a primarily retentive bonus plan.\u201d Congress has barred retention bonuses for senior managers.  For objections to the original plan, click here for the Dec. 17 Bloomberg bankruptcy report.  Backed by Barry Diller, Aereo was forced to shut down following a June 25 Supreme Court decision that the service violated broadcasters\u2019 programming copyright protections. The company petitioned for Chapter 11 protection in November. Its assets are to go up for auction on Feb. 24.  Developed with approximately $95.6 million in equity investments, Aereo listed assets of $20.5 million and liabilities totaling $4.2 million, not including liabilities for copyright infringement. Net operating losses of as much as $100 million could be an additional asset. There is no secured debt.  The case is In re Aereo Inc., 14-bk-13200, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  Alsip Acquisition LLC received the green light to sell its idled paper mill in Illinois to Paper Mill Acquisition LLC, the winner at an auction.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin J. Carey in Delaware signed an order Jan. 8 approving the sale to the winning bidder, which is affiliated with Corrugated Supplies Co. The purchase price is about $8.2 million, according to court papers.  The bankruptcy, which began Nov. 20, was structured to sell the mill\u2019s real estate and equipment to Montreal-based Resolute Forest Products Inc. for $5 million, subject to competitive bidding.  The Chapter 11 effort is being financed by pre-bankruptcy lender Wells Fargo Bank NA, which is owed about $8 million.  The sale-approval order provides that Alsip will pay all proceeds, net of $250,000 in bid protections owed to Resolute, directly to Wells Fargo.  Alsip, which idled its mill in September, called itself the leading North American provider of \u201cresponsibly made\u201d recycled paper for books and magazines. It\u2019s about 91 percent owned by FutureMark Holdings LLC, according to court papers.  The petition listed assets and liabilities each exceeding $10 million.  The case is In re Alsip Acquisition LLC, 14-bk-12596, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  The trustee for First Place Financial Corp. sued Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP in October 2014 for failing to disclose all of $573,000 in compensation the firm received in the month preceding bankruptcy by the bank holding company. Patton Boggs had been the holding company\u2019s bankruptcy lawyers while it was in Chapter 11.  Last week the trustee filed papers for approval of a settlement to take $150,000 in resolution of all claims. The hearing for approval will take place Feb. 18 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.  The trustee doesn\u2019t much explain the basis for the settlement except to say that Patton Boggs asserted defenses while litigation could be costly with uncertain outcome.  First Place filed under Chapter 11 in October 2012 and won authority from the bankruptcy court in December 2012 to sell its 41-branch First Place Bank to Talmer Bancorp Inc.  Patton Boggs LLP had filed papers saying it was paid $214,000 in the year before bankruptcy.  The First Place reorganization was converted to liquidation in Chapter 7 in March 2013 when the trustee was appointed. In June 2013, the bankruptcy court approved more than $1 million in fees to Patton Boggs for work during the Chapter 11 case. The trustee, George L. Miller, said he discovered that the firm had been paid $573,000 within one month before bankruptcy.  Based in Warren, Ohio, First Place listed assets of $175.3 million and liabilities totaling $64.5 million. Debt at the outset of bankruptcy included $64.3 million on three issues of junior subordinated notes held by trusts affiliated with First Place. The First Place bank subsidiary was not in bankruptcy.  Assets included $7.5 million cash mostly held at the bank.  The case is In re First Place Financial Corp., 12-12961, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  The former owner of the Fox & Hound and Champps casual dining restaurants, in bankruptcy for more than a year, wants another 90-day extension of its exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan.  The company is still reconciling claims, particularly priority and administrative ones, which will help it resolve the Chapter 11 case, according to a Jan. 9 court filing.  It has been working closely with the official creditors\u2019 committee to resolve claims. In November, the company filed its first notice of satisfied claims, according to court papers. At the end of December, it filed its first objection covering multiple claims, which is scheduled for a hearing on Feb. 9.  The proposed exclusivity extension, which would be the fourth, will give the company the time it needs to continue the claim-resolution process and determine the \u201cappropriate exit mechanism,\u201d according to court papers.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross in Delaware is to rule on the extension request at a Feb. 9 hearing. The new plan-filing deadline would be April 13.  The company began bankruptcy with approximately 101 stores in 27 states. Lender Cerberus Business Finance LLC bought the business in March without an auction. In connection with the sale, about 70 restaurant locations were given over to Cerberus.  At the outset of bankruptcy, the company said it had about $119 million in debt, including approximately $68.4 million owing on a first-lien loan with General Electric Capital Corp. as agent, $39.8 million owing on a second-lien loan with Cerberus as agent, and $11.2 million in unsecured debt.  The parent holding company, F&J Acquisition Corp., is in Wichita, Kansas.  The case is In re F&H Acquisition Corp., 13-bk-13220, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  Wet Seal Inc., a 511-store retailer catering to teen girls and young women, announced last week that it was closing 388 locations responsible for generating 48 percent of sales.  The 173 remaining stores, representing what was one-third of the chain, are located in 42 states. The Foothill Ranch, California-based company has been operating under a forbearance agreement with lenders on $27 million in senior convertible notes.  Wet Seal said it was forced to close the stores given the inability to negotiate concessions with landlords. It remains to be seen whether lawsuits by landlords will force the company into bankruptcy. Last month, Wet Seal said that bankruptcy was among its options.  Wet Seal reported a $74.2 million operating loss on revenue of $316.3 million over the first three quarters of 2014. The net loss for the period was $79.7 million.  Even before the store closings, the balance sheet was upside down on Nov. 1, with assets of $92.9 million and liabilities totaling $103.4 million.  Liberty Tire Recycling Holdco LLC, a Pittsburgh-based tire recycler, violated financial covenants as a result of weak operating performance.  On the \u201cheightened probability\u201d that the company could undergo a distressed exchange, redemption, or default on its debt absent a significant equity infusion, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the corporate and senior unsecured notes ratings by three steps last week to CCC- from B-.  Liberty Tire is operating under a forbearance agreement expiring Jan. 30 and has engaged financial advisory firms to develop a restructuring plan, according to S&P.  S&P said the company could announce a distressed exchange, redemption, or default within three months.  Statute of Repose Is Tolled by Section 546(a), Judge Says  The U.S. Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco was saddled with a complex case concerning the difference between a statute of limitations and a statute of repose. Making the issue more difficult, courts around the country disagree on the outcome, and there were two unreported Ninth Circuit decisions with conflicting results.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Ralph Kirscher solved the conundrum in part by citing the intent of Congress to \u201cmaximize the estate for the benefit of creditors.\u201d  The case involved a company operated as a Ponzi scheme. The bankruptcy began in late December 2010. The trustee filed fraudulent-transfer suits in early December 2012 to recover transfers going back seven years from the petition date, to December 2003.  The defendants persuaded the bankruptcy judge to dismiss the suit as to claims more than seven years before the trustee filed his complaint. Kirscher reversed, saying the lower court didn\u2019t properly apply Section 546(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which allows a trustee to sue within two years of bankruptcy on claims that hadn\u2019t expired before bankruptcy.  The defendants relied on California\u2019s statute of repose, which bars claims based on acts taking place more than seven years before a suit is filed, even if the statute of limitations has yet to lapse because the plaintiff didn\u2019t have notice of the potential claim. The defendants said that Section 546(a) doesn\u2019t apply to statutes of repose.  Kirscher said there are two unreported decisions from the Ninth Circuit on the issue that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with each other. Courts elsewhere in the U.S. also disagree over whether statutes of repose are tolled by Section 546(a).  When it comes to a conflict between the state law of repose and federal law, Section 546(a) wins out and allows the trustee to sue going back seven years from the date of bankruptcy, Kirscher said. That\u2019s when the judge said Congress intends to \u201cmaximize\u201d recoveries in bankruptcy.  The case is Fund v. Bank of America Corp. (In re EPD Investment Co.), 13-1374, U.S. Ninth Circuit Court Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (San Francisco).

Wet Seal, based in Foothill Ranch, California, has lost more than $150 million over the past two years and defaulted on $27 million in senior convertible notes in December. The company said it has a reorganization plan under which B. Riley Financial Inc. will acquire 80 percent of its stock in exchange for a $20 million loan to fund operations during bankruptcy. Riley is the parent of liquidator Great American Group LLC. The retailer joins Deb Stores Holding LLC, Loehmann\u2019s Inc. and Coldwater Creek Inc. in filing for bankruptcy. A slowdown in mall traffic has sent sales tumbling. Wet Seal\u2019s comparable-store sales, a key retail benchmark, declined 15 percent in the third of quarter of 2014, according to company filings. \u201cThe continuing fundamental shift in consumer behavior away from traditional mall shopping toward online-only stores and increased competition throughout the specialty retail fashion industry have created a difficult operating environment,\u201d Thomas Hillebrandt, Wet Seal\u2019s chief financial officer, said in the company\u2019s Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. The retailer said it engaged Houlihan Lokey Capital Inc. in November to explore strategic alternatives including a potential sale, potential refinancing, and potential debt or equity investment in the company. Only Riley was willing to provide debtor-in-possession financing in addition to an exit strategy that gives the retailer the option to continue as a going concern, according to court papers. \u201cAt present, the teen retail sector is in such distress that even potential lenders who might typically make distressed loans have been reticent to advance funds into this sector,\u201d Derek Pitts, managing director with Houlihan Lokey, said in court papers. Without the plan sponsorship and DIP financing from Riley, \u201cin my view, the debtors would have no clear exit path, and insufficient liquidity to run anything other than an expedited sale process, potentially by way of a naked auction,\u201d Pitts said. In its December bankruptcy filing, Deb Stores said a shortage of capital left it with \u201cold, tired stores.\u201d Loehmann\u2019s began its bankruptcy in December 2013, while Coldwater Creek sought creditor protection in April with plans to liquidate. Dots LLC filed in January 2014 and Ashley Stewart filed in March as sales declined and losses mounted. Wet Seal operates 173 stores in 42 states and Puerto Rico, as well as a  . It closed 338 stores around Jan. 7, Hillebrandt said in the filing. Third-quarter net sales totaled $104.3 million, compared with $114.9 million in the same period the year before. Ed Thomas, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said today in a statement that directors \u201cunanimously concluded\u201d that filing was the \u201cappropriate course of action.\u201d The retailer listed assets as of Nov. 1 of $93 million and debt of $103 million in the Chapter 11 documents. Wet Seal said it has about $250 million in tax losses it will try to preserve while in bankruptcy. The company and creditor Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd. entered a forbearance agreement on Dec. 29 that ended Jan. 12, according to a regulatory filing. The total amount due is equal to $28.8 million plus the costs of collection, attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, Wet Seal said in the filing.

Now it\u2019s losing tenants and customers, reflecting the travails of retail real estate across the U.S. The Gateway\u2019s owner, Retail Properties of America Inc., wrote down its value to $75 million last year after failing to sell the 623,972-square-foot (57,946-square-meter) property and abandoning a planned upgrade. It was valued at $163 million in February 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The mall\u2019s slide prompted Moody\u2019s Investors Service to cut the ratings on a 2010 commercial-mortgage bond offering, the first deal of its kind sold after the financial crisis to be downgraded. Bondholders may be more vulnerable to losses on defaulted retail loans than they realize as the segment trails the recovery in other types of commercial property, said Richard Hill, a real estate debt analyst at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of complacency among investors,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetitive pressures that haven\u2019t been seen in decades are making some retailers and some properties obsolete.\u201d Last week,  , an apparel retailer catering to young women, announced it\u2019s closing about two-thirds of its stores. Upscale clothing-and-houseware chain C. Wonder also said it\u2019s shutting down, and J.C. Penney Co. announced plans to close 40 stores this year. Even as U.S. real estate prices surpass their November 2007 peak, neighborhood shopping centers, malls and other retail properties remain 15 percent below their record, according to indexes compiled by Moody\u2019s and Real Capital Analytics Inc. Retail is the only major type of commercial real estate, which also includes office buildings and warehouses, that failed to achieve price growth of at least 10 percent in the 12 months through November. Malls are fighting over a shrinking pool of tenants as shoppers increasingly turn to the Internet. Booksellers and electronics retailers are folding or shifting their focus to online marketing, while struggling department stores leave behind large empty locations. The closing of several Sears Holdings Corp. stores pushed the vacancy rate at regional malls up 0.1 percent to 8 percent at the end of last year, the first quarterly increase since 2011, according to property-research firm Reis Inc. While the occupancy rate at smaller neighborhood and community shopping centers is improving along with the U.S. economy, the recovery has been slow, Ryan Severino, senior economist at New York-based Reis, said in a report last week. The national vacancy rate has fallen 90 basis points since peaking at 11.1 percent in the third quarter of 2011, representing a \u201cstill-weak market environment,\u201d according to Severino. \u201cThe slow but steady declines in vacancy will eventually translate into more meaningful rent increases, but that is not likely to occur in the near term,\u201d he wrote in the report. A $101 million loan on the Gateway was bundled with debt on 95 other properties across the U.S. and sold to investors in the 2010 bond offering, data compiled by Bloomberg show. City Creek Center, a 626,000-square-foot shopping center less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away, was under construction at the time, according to a prospectus for potential investors in the commercial mortgage-backed securities. Now that mall is open, and it lured the city\u2019s only Apple Inc. store from Gateway. Moody\u2019s assigned the Gateway loan a \u201chigh default probability\u201d in a report last month when the rating company downgraded the CMBS transaction, citing declining performance at the Gateway as the primary reason for the action. Taubman Centers Inc.\u2019s City Creek Center, completed in 2012, is siphoning off tenants, dragging the Gateway\u2019s occupancy rate down to 78 percent from 96 percent in 2010, Moody\u2019s said. Kimberly Freely, a spokeswoman for Oak Brook, Illinois-based Retail Properties of America, declined to comment on the Gateway. Malls aren\u2019t at risk of disappearing altogether. High-end retail centers are benefiting as sought-after tenants gravitate toward top-tier properties, enabling landlords at those locations to raise rents, according to Nathan Isbee, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Vacancies at such malls have almost vanished, according to Reis. \u201cThe malls that really dominate their trade area are going to be fine,\u201d Isbee said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t see an environment where the high-end mall becomes irrelevant.\u201d Lower-quality malls will find it increasingly difficult to compete, according to Hill of Morgan Stanley. CMBS investors may suffer losses, with retail properties accounting for as much as 50 percent of deals sold in 2010 and 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. CMBS deals can be linked to any type of commercial real estate, ranging from regional malls and office towers to self-storage facilities and nursing homes. Moody\u2019s in 2012 raised concern about the quality of the malls being included in CMBS deals, saying that a growing number appeared poised to fail. Losses on retail loans that default tend to be high relative to other types of property debt because a mall often has to be demolished or completely refurbished, according to Moody\u2019s. Second and third-tier malls will be at greater risk in 2015 amid a sluggish economic recovery for low-income consumers, according to Fitch Ratings. Such malls \u201cwill be subject to relatively rapid and substantial performance declines that may lead to outsized losses,\u201d Fitch said in a report today. Regional malls with low per-square-foot tenant sales that have lost their relevance probably will be closed or reused for a purpose other than retail over the next several years, according to DJ Busch, a mall REIT analyst at research company Green Street Advisors LLC. \u201cWe certainly expect more malls to close than open over the next several years,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1421042400.0,"participant_ids":["MCO:US","RPAI:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-12\/utah-mall-s-travails-expose-property-weak-link-mortgages","subject":"Utah Mall\u2019s Travails Expose Property Weak Link: Mortgages"},{"body":"  Willis Group Holdings Plc\u2019s chief executive officer, who is taking a lesser role under the insurance broker\u2019s planned merger with Towers Watson & Co., has opted against taking some compensation that he was entitled to get. \u201cDominic Casserley will not receive a severance payment on accepting the position of president & deputy CEO in a merged Willis Towers Watson,\u201d Miles Russell, a spokesman for the London-based insurance broker said in an e-mailed statement Tuesday.

ADP is introducing an online service known as a private exchange that will let workers shop for insurance coverage among multiple health plans, much the same way consumers can select policies on a government-run exchange under Obamacare. One new feature is designed to help companies limit costs: Employees can be given a fixed sum of money to spend on the plan they pick, with any extra cost coming out of each paycheck. Exchanges have caught on in recent years as a way for employers to give employees more choices of coverage and potentially shift more of the cost to them as well. About 40 million people will pick a health plan for 2018 through an online exchange, up from 6 million for this year, according to Accenture Plc. \u201cMore people are going to need this high-grade shopping experience, they\u2019re going to want more information, and they\u2019re going to want to take more control over their health care,\u201d Gerry Leonard, president of ADP Benefits Services, said in an interview. ADP, which handles health benefits for about 15 million people, has been expanding its offerings as companies work to comply with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law, known as Obamacare, requires many employers to provide health coverage to more workers and sets rules about what the policies need to include. ADP\u2019s website works with its other offerings that help employers manage payroll and benefits. That could help it compete with exchanges offered by firms like Aon Plc, Towers Watson and Marsh & McLennan\u2019s Mercer. Willis Group Holdings Plc said in June that it would merge with Towers Watson, in part to expand in employee benefits such as insurance exchanges.  will help companies pick health plans to offer on ADP\u2019s exchange, though employers also can use their own broker instead. \u201cThis question of payroll integration is one of the fundamental benefits administration challenges that needs to be solved,\u201d said Rich Birhanzel, managing director for Accenture\u2019s health administration services business. \u201cOne could imagine that that kind of package capability could be attractive to an employer.\u201d Cary Grace, chief executive officer of Aon Exchange Solutions, said ADP\u2019s new offering underscores the increasing demand for private insurance exchanges. \u201cADP\u2019s announcement validates our vision of private health exchanges as an important and growing market trend,\u201d Grace said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cAon offers the broadest and deepest portfolio for companies of all sizes and industries.\u201d A tax on high-cost health plans that starts in 2018 is fueling employers\u2019 search for cheaper coverage options, ADP\u2019s Leonard said. The so-called Cadillac Tax, part of the Affordable Care Act, imposes a 40 percent levy on family plans with premiums that top $27,500 and individual plans costing more than $10,200. \u201cAs we approach 2018, we\u2019re going to start seeing activity really picking up more,\u201d said  , an analyst at consulting firm NelsonHall. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a question of if organizations are going to move to private exchanges. It\u2019s a question of when.\u201d It\u2019s not clear that having employees pick coverage options on a private exchange can keep the total cost down, Leonard said. It does let employers shift more of the expense to their workers, by providing them with a fixed sum of money. That could be a good thing for healthier workers, who might need less care. Yet sicker employees could wind up paying more, particularly if the cost of insurance increases more quickly than the size of the employer subsidy. A tie-up with closely held   represents a second avenue for cost savings. Through GoHealth, ADP will help employees who don\u2019t get workplace coverage -- such as part-timers -- select health plans on public exchanges, where they might be eligible for subsidies. The integration could let employers drop part-time workers from their health plans without making them feel abandoned, according to Ryan Smolek, vice president of operations at GoHealth. \u201cThere is a calculation that needs to be done about whether the employee is better off under group insurance in the company versus on the exchange,\u201d he said.","timestamp":1438840800.0,"participant_ids":["TW:US","AON:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-06\/adp-to-help-employers-set-up-their-own-health-insurance-markets","subject":"ADP Helps Firms Set Up Their Own Health Insurance Markets"},{"body":"Stakeholders who own millions of shares in Towers Watson & Co. are planning to vote against the firm\u2019s $8.7 billion merger with Willis Group Holdings Plc if the terms of the transactions are not improved, people with knowledge of the matter said.

A combination would provide \u201ca more efficient tax profile for Towers Watson,\u201d the consulting firm said in a letter to investors Wednesday. With the lower rate, the company will be \u201csaving approximately $75 million annually within two years.\u201d Towers Watson is facing investor   that it agreed to unfavorable terms with Willis, whose shareholders will hold about 50.1 percent of the combined company, under a cash-and-stock deal announced in June. The consulting firm was valued at about $8.7 billion based on Willis\u2019s share price when the agreement was announced, and Towers Watson dropped 8.8 percent that day. Driehaus Capital Management LLC faulted the deal as a \u201ctakeunder\u201d and urged fellow investors to oppose the transaction. The vote is scheduled for Nov. 18. Darren Marcus, an analyst at MKM Partners, said that taxes were probably among many considerations for management when weighing a transaction. He pointed out that Aon Plc, which provides insurance-brokerage and consulting services, moved years ago to London from Chicago. Still, he said that companies have to walk a fine line when discussing taxes. President Barack Obama has faulted U.S. companies that move overseas in search of lower corporate tax bills. And billionaire investor Carl Icahn said in a letter posted on his website that he would fund a political effort to reverse the \u201cpernicious effects that are occurring and will continue to occur as a result of Congress\u2019s failure to immediately stop so many of our great companies from leaving our country.\u201d Because of the political climate, companies are \u201cnot going to come out and say, \u2018Hey we\u2019re doing this deal because we\u2019re saving so much on taxes,\u2019\u201d Marcus said in a phone interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t come out and say that. But if you\u2019re following all the rules, and you\u2019re merging with a company that happens to be domiciled somewhere else, and you could justify why you\u2019ll be domiciled there, then great. It\u2019s a great benefit.\u201d The merger partners acknowledged from the beginning that Towers Watson would enjoy lower rates after a transaction. In a June 30 conference call held by the companies, the tax benefit was described as \u201ca nice consequence\u201d of a deal that was driven by business purposes. In a July presentation, Towers Watson said tax savings would contribute about one-third of the $4.7 billion in value that the company predicted would be created by a deal. In a footnote in that presentation, the consulting firm said that was based on $75 million of tax savings a year. The letter Wednesday is more explicit, using capital letters to help highlight the point. The deal provides \u201cClearly Identified and Highly Achievable Cost Synergies and  Domicile Tax Benefits,\u201d wrote Towers Watson Chief Executive Officer John Haley and lead independent director Linda Rabbitt. Haley, who would lead the combined company, also said a deal would provide opportunities to increase revenue, add clients and cut costs. \u201cBased on our proven track record of realizing synergies in other business combinations, we are confident in our ability to achieve these synergies,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition to the highly achievable cost savings, the combined organization will maintain Willis\u2019  domicile, which is expected to lower our effective tax rate to the mid-20% range \u2013 compared to the current tax rate in the mid-30% range.\u201d","timestamp":1445429766.0,"participant_ids":["TW:US","WSH:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-21\/towers-touts-irish-tax-edge-on-8-7-billion-deal-as-vote-nears","subject":"Towers Touts Irish Tax Edge on $8.7 Billion Deal as Vote Nears"},{"body":"Towers Watson & Co. investors should reject a planned merger with insurance broker Willis Group Holdings Plc, proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and\u00a0Glass Lewis & Co. said.

GE paid $314,511 last year for Immelt\u2019s two life insurance plans, the most for a CEO in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 100 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It\u2019s one of a shrinking number of companies offering coverage designed exclusively for top managers. On the lower end, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Apple Inc. spent $101 and $2,520, respectively, on policies for CEOs Jamie Dimon and Tim Cook. While many boards have scaled back executive perquisites after increased disclosure requirements and heightened scrutiny of pay practices, life insurance benefits -- a ubiquitous part of estate planning for high-earning Americans because of the tax advantages -- have received little attention. Life insurance expenses are often lumped together with \u201can array of deferred compensation-related items, making it hard for investors to parse the details,\u201d said Michael Pryce-Jones, director of corporate governance at CtW Investment Group, which advocates for pension funds that collectively manage $250 billion. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s on the radar for shareholders in the way it should be.\u201d Executive insurance policies are reserved for a limited group of top leaders, a review of proxy filings shows. Last year, at least 10 companies in the S&P 100 Index offered their CEOs universal, or permanent, policies typically designed to last the insured\u2019s lifetime. Some of the annual premiums go into investment accounts that can grow tax-free. Immelt\u2019s coverage includes two universal life insurance policies. One will pay two times his annual salary and bonus, which totaled $9.2 million last year, and the other provides a $3 million death benefit that\u2019s grown 4 percent annually since he first enrolled, according to Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE\u2019s most-recent  . GE, the world\u2019s largest maker of jet engines and gas turbines, has spent more than $1.43 million on premiums for Immelt since he became CEO in 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 3M Co. paid $286,115 in premiums last year for CEO Inge Thulin\u2019s executive life insurance, which has a death benefit of about $10.4 million, according to a  . Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s Rex Tillerson and Honeywell International Inc.\u2019s David Cote have accumulated benefits worth $11.5 million and $10 million in their executive life insurance plans, respectively. \u201cWe provide our named executives with additional benefits that we believe are reasonable, competitive and consistent with the company\u2019s overall executive compensation program,\u201d Dominic McMullan, a spokesman for GE, said in an e-mailed statement. Spokesmen for 3M, Exxon and Honeywell declined to comment. Of the 51 companies in the S&P 100 that disclosed expenses for CEO life insurance premiums last year, JPMorgan spent the least. Dimon\u2019s plan, which provides a maximum coverage of $100,000, is available to all benefit-eligible employees, according to a  . \u201cOur compensation philosophy is to have a transparent and fair compensation program for senior executives with no special insurance, health or medical benefits,\u201d Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the largest U.S. bank, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cThe board thought this was the most fair way to do it.\u201d Apple offers Cook the same insurance that\u2019s available to all employees. Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment beyond its proxy filing. Companies must report perks given to any named executive officer if the annual aggregate value exceeds $10,000. Specific dollar amounts must be disclosed for all benefits that make up more than 10 percent of that sum or are worth more than $25,000. While most Americans who buy policies do so to replace lost income after the death of a household breadwinner, the nation\u2019s affluent often beef up their coverage to help heirs avoid fire-sales of assets to pay estate taxes. The federal tax on estates worth more than $5.43 million is 40 percent. Including state levies, the government\u2019s total share can approach 50 percent, an amount that can be difficult to pay for estates with significant assets tied up in illiquid holdings such as real estate, said Ivan Taback, a trusts and estates partner at law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP. \u201cOftentimes, they do not realize that their beneficiaries will have to come up with a massive check nine months after they die,\u201d Taback said. Beneficiaries of company-owned plans can collect death benefits tax-free as long as the insured doesn\u2019t have a controlling stake in the company. To avoid having the death benefit included in the taxable estate, many people assign ownership of their privately purchased plans to irrevocable trusts, according to Parker Beauchamp, CEO of Inguard, a Wabash, Indiana-based insurance firm. \u201cCreating the liquidity to pay estate taxes can literally save the beneficiaries millions\u201d if it can help preserve income-generating assets, said Beauchamp, who specializes in plans for clients with complex needs such as billionaires and professional athletes. The share of Fortune 500 companies offering supplemental policies to their CEOs fell to fewer than 25 percent in 2013, down from 52 percent in 2008, according to a   by Towers Watson & Co., a human resource consulting firm. Bolstered compensation-disclosure rules and the implementation of advisory say-on-pay votes at annual meetings have fueled a retrenchment of company-provided perks, said Keir Gumbs, a partner at law firm Covington & Burling LLP. Johnson & Johnson closed its executive life insurance program to new participants in January \u201cin response to feedback and market data,\u201d according to a March 11  . Exxon stopped giving the benefit to new executives in 2007. Firms including PepsiCo Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. highlight in proxy filings that they don\u2019t offer company-paid supplemental insurance policies to executives. Spokesmen for the companies declined to comment. Term policies, such as those provided to JPMorgan\u2019s Dimon and Apple\u2019s Cook, usually lapse when the covered employee leaves. GE\u2019s Immelt and 3M\u2019s Thulin are both covered by universal, or permanent, policies, which are more expensive. While the premiums for term plans cover only the insurance, part of the annual cost for a permanent plan goes into an investment account. The balance grows and can be withdrawn free of taxes, making such policies attractive to some clients, Inguard\u2019s Beauchamp said. Both General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra and Caterpillar Inc.\u2019s Douglas Oberhelman have company-paid variable life insurance policies, permanent plans that can give owners control over how the cash value is invested, proxy filings show. Spokesmen for GM and Caterpillar declined to comment beyond the filings. Variable plans that offer investment opportunities in hedge funds or private-equity funds have grown in popularity among affluent clients in recent years, said Joshua Husbands, a partner at Holland & Knight LLP. \u201cThese are the types of investments high-income folks would be making anyway -- and now they\u2019re available on a tax-preferential basis through an insurance policy,\u201d Husbands said. \u201cLife insurance isn\u2019t just about the death benefit anymore.\u201d","timestamp":1440050407.0,"participant_ids":["GE:US","AAPL:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-20\/ge-s-death-perk-for-immelt-a-22-million-life-insurance-benefit","subject":"GE\u2019s Death Perk for Immelt Is a $22 Million Life Insurance Benefit"},{"body":"Towers Watson & Co. won shareholder approval for an $8.9 billion merger with Willis Group Holdings Plc after negotiating better terms with the insurance broker.

Instead of picking a companywide health plan, employers are increasingly giving workers financial support to choose their own from a menu of options. For 2015, 6 million workers selected coverage from markets run by private benefits administrators, according to a study from Accenture Plc. That\u2019s double the previous year, when   of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and Darden Restaurants Inc. all had to go shop on their own. By 2018, a quarter of employees who get insurance through work will pick a plan through the private markets, according to Accenture. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly the way health care is heading,\u201d said Jean Moore, a managing director at Towers Watson & Co., which runs online benefits markets for employers. The change represents a fundamental shift in the employer-employee relationship, and also mirrors trends in Obamacare, where the U.S. gives people tax credits to help buy insurance on government markets. It may also put more of the financial burden of health care on workers, though it can save employers money and may bolster earnings at benefits consultants like Towers Watson and Aon Plc. Towers Watson gets about 10 percent of its sales by operating the online portals for its clients, and exchange revenue   among the company\u2019s major business lines in the final three months of last year. While privately run insurance exchanges are separate from the marketplaces operated by the U.S. government and some states under Obamacare, the same principle applies: individuals choose from a variety of plans with different premiums, copays, deductibles and coverage options. About 11.7 million people enrolled in government-run marketplaces this year. Employers can benefit from switching to a private exchange because they can set aside a fixed amount of money that workers use to pick an insurance option from companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc., Aetna Inc. or Cigna Corp., among others. While that could be good for relatively healthy employees who can choose cheaper plans, it can also mean that other workers are left covering more of the costs out of pocket. Cost Control? While private exchanges help employers limit what they pay for health benefits, it\u2019s not yet clear whether they help keep health-care costs under control, said Rich Birhanzel, managing director for Accenture Health Administration Services. If they don\u2019t, workers could be responsible for an increasing share of their health-care costs over time. So far, midsized companies have been the main users of private exchanges, Birhanzel said. He said he expects larger employers to increasingly use the portals as well, especially in preparation for a federal levy on high-cost health plans, dubbed the Cadillac Tax. That 40 percent tax on costly health benefits, part of the Affordable Care Act, starts in 2018. It\u2019ll initially hit family plans where premiums exceed $27,500 and individual plans costing at least $10,200. Premiums for family coverage averaged   in 2014, up 3 percent from a year earlier and compared with $5,791 in  , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Workers picked up about $4,823 of the tab. A single person paid $1,081 of the $6,025 premium on average last year. Aon and Towers Watson are among the largest exchange operators, each covering about 1.2 million people. Aon\u2019s exchange is targeted at larger companies. New York-based Towers Watson has drawn the most interest from firms with 3,000 to 10,000 employees, though larger employers are warming up to the idea, according to Moore. The surge of demand for private exchanges helped lift Towers Watson shares 20 percent in the past year to $132.67 Tuesday, near their March 2 closing record of $134.62. London-based Aon has risen 20 percent in the past year.  people get coverage from exchanges run by Marsh & McLennan Cos.\u2019 Mercer unit. Xerox Corp.\u2019s Buck Consultants unit said about 700,000 individuals got coverage via its offering. Accenture consults with exchange operators and employers, but doesn\u2019t offer its own insurance marketplace, Birhanzel said. Exchanges can give companies more bargaining power with insurers, according to Towers Watson\u2019s Moore. She said companies on her exchange have managed to slow the pace of increases in health-care costs. While the private exchanges can be a way for employers to reduce how much they pay for health care, they can also give workers more choices, Moore said. Some may opt for reduced benefits, while others will pay up for comprehensive coverage. \u201cEmployers have been shifting more and more costs to their employees because they can\u2019t afford not to,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe thing about exchanges that really provides value to employees is that there\u2019s so much choice, so as an employee is faced with a set amount from the employer, they have a number of different options.\u201d","timestamp":1428393600.0,"participant_ids":["TW:US","ACN:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-07\/mounting-health-costs-lead-to-growth-spurt-for-private-exchanges","subject":"Workers to Shop for Health Plans as Employers Quit Benefits"},{"body":" Willis Group Holdings Plc, the third-largest insurance broker by market value, agreed to take a majority stake in Miller Insurance Services LLP to expand in London. Willis will take an 85 percent stake, and partners of Miller will retain the remainder, the London-based buyer said today in a statement that didn\u2019t disclose terms. The deal is expected to be completed next quarter, according to the statement. Willis Chief Executive Officer Dominic Casserley has been making acquisitions to add clients as he   by moving jobs to lower-cost locations. Casserley has announced at least seven deals since taking the top post in January of 2013. Miller helps arrange sales of property-casualty insurance and works with clients in industries including shipping, construction and energy. Consolidation \u201cis how the bigger brokers have been built,\u201d Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., said in an interview before today\u2019s announcement. Willis\u2019s plan to maintain Miller as a separate brand could allow Casserley\u2019s firm to build relationships \u201cwith clients or even employees who don\u2019t want to work with, or for, one of the big global brokers.\u201d The deal will help Willis expand in the wholesale market, where companies act as intermediaries between retail brokers and insurers. Both companies started as marine insurers more than a century ago. Willis\u2019 global marine business manages more than $2 billion of premiums annually, according to the company\u2019s website. \u201cWhen you look at the wholesale market, what you\u2019re talking about are individual niches of expertise that you can\u2019t just replicate,\u201d Shields said. Miller has a \u201cvery strong reputation but is at an intensified competitive disadvantage because of their size.\u201d Willis climbed 0.2 percent to $43.19 at 1:48 p.m. in New York. The company has dropped about 4.7 percent in the past year. Miller, which has no external shareholders, had revenue of 112.9 million pounds ($190 million) in the year ended April 30, according to its  . The London-based company has offices in locations including Belgium, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Brazil. Casserley\u2019s acquisition strategy focuses on \u201cspecialty situations which have strong franchises,\u201d he said Oct. 29 in a conference call, after announcing earlier in the month that his company was in talks with Miller. \u201cWe would not be going after volume.\u201d Willis announced plans in April to eliminate jobs and relocate 3,500 workers to lower-cost locations. The broker has more than 18,000 employees in over 400 offices, according to its  .

Three years later, Jes Staley is the closest he\u2019s ever been to getting a big bank\u2019s chief executive officer seat. The wrinkle is that it\u2019s at Barclays, a firm where performance is dragging, Chairman John McFarlane has suggested competing with U.S. rivals is futile, the last two CEOs were pressured to leave, and bankers have jokingly revised \u201cRISES,\u201d a company motto, to \u201cCRISES.\u201d Staley, 58, has to come up with a way to fix Barclays\u2019s investment bank, its least profitable unit. If he has a good solution, he\u2019ll complete his ascent from a Pennsylvania high school student who eased his stutter by giving speeches on subjects picked from a bowl to a CEO with a shot at reviving Britain\u2019s second-biggest lender. \u201cJes has risen to the occasion over his entire career, and I\u2019ve been up close and watched it,\u201d said Sandy Warner, J.P. Morgan & Co.\u2019s CEO before its 2000 merger with Chase Manhattan Bank. \u201cHaving said that, I\u2019ve asked myself a couple of times, God, I\u2019ve run one of these things, is this a doable job? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Staley was   by U.K. regulators last week, the final hurdle to his appointment. The bank is awaiting their approval before it can name a new CEO. Staley, who declined to comment for this story, has dealt with Wall Street strife before. When he was promoted in 2009 from head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s asset-management unit to take over all investment banking, he was seen as a top candidate to succeed Dimon. A year later, Staley told an interviewer for a magazine profile he would leave after a few years if Dimon didn\u2019t step aside. Dimon stayed and demoted Staley in 2012 during the reshuffling that followed a loss of about $6.2 billion by a trader known as the London Whale. Staley wasn\u2019t in charge of the unit where the loss occurred. He left the bank in 2013 for BlueMountain Capital Management, a hedge fund that helped JPMorgan unwind its Whale positions after   by being on the other side of some of the bets. A day after the job announcement, Dimon told a San Francisco conference that some of his top executives had \u201cacted like children\u201d during the Whale fallout. He didn\u2019t name names. \u201cThey were running around with their head chopped off, \u2018What does this mean for me personally, how\u2019s my reputation?\u2019\u201d Dimon said. \u201cYou learn the good and the bad about people, and that\u2019s invaluable.\u201d Dimon\u2019s decade-long reign at the top at JPMorgan, where former members of his inner circle have taken top jobs at Visa Inc., First Data Corp. and Standard Chartered Plc instead of replacing him, has outlasted three CEOs at Barclays. Staley, who met his wife in Brazil, has two daughters and lives in New York, could be the next. His custom-made 91-foot yacht has sailed to Europe before, according to a letter he wrote to the boatyard that built it, describing his dip in the cold Baltic Sea and the boat\u2019s cedar and ash. He went to Bowdoin College in Maine and high school in Pennsylvania, where he joined the debate team and practiced speaking off the cuff to overcome a stutter. \u201cI remember when the letter B scared me, and I remember when I would do anything to try to avoid the letter W,\u201d Staley said while accepting an award from the American Institute for Stuttering last year. \u201cToward the end of my senior year we actually started here and there to insert a sentence that began with the word \u2018why.\u2019\u201d Colleagues said Staley was open to learning as a boss at JPMorgan, where he spent 34 years and managed the firm\u2019s brokerage in Brazil before moving to New York. \u201cWhat made him a good boss is that he was consultative -- it wasn\u2019t, \u2018Let\u2019s do this,\u2019 there was a discussion,\u201d said Houda Foster, who worked for him after his private-banking promotion in 1999. \u201cYou get your people to accept the goals without realizing that they\u2019re being led.\u201d Rick Lazio, the former Republican Congressman from New York who joined JPMorgan in 2004 as a government-relations executive and took a seat on its executive committee, said Staley wasn\u2019t afraid to take risk. Some of those risks worked out better than others. He helped make JPMorgan one of the world\u2019s biggest hedge-fund managers after championing its acquisition of Highbridge Capital Management, whose assets rose to $28 billion this year from $7 billion when the partnership was announced in 2004. JPMorgan is close to   most of the business to the executives who run it, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Staley\u2019s oversight of a deal with American Century Investments didn\u2019t go as smoothly. According to arbitrators, his team promised to promote that firm\u2019s products when the bank acquired its retirement-plan services unit. Then JPMorgan employees pushed their own firm\u2019s products, with Staley mistakenly thinking that the fee his bank would have to pay American Century if it didn\u2019t keep its word was capped. The arbitrators   JPMorgan to pay American Century $373 million in 2011. A spokesperson for the bank said later that it strongly disagreed with the decision and the award. The challenges facing the next CEO at Barclays are immense. Bob Diamond, the Massachusetts-raised executive who oversaw the investment bank\u2019s expansion, was pressured to leave in 2012 after Barclays admitted to rigging global interest rates. He\u2019s a former bond trader who told Parliament in 2011 that the era of \u201cremorse and apology\u201d from bankers should be over, while Staley said last year they\u2019ve got to win \u201cthe trust and respect of broader society.\u201d The board wanted Staley to replace Diamond, according to three people involved in the 2012 CEO race, but chose someone else because of fear that regulators, politicians and the media would be infuriated by another American investment banker taking control of London-based Barclays. Directors were especially nervous because they\u2019d have to pay him about $30 million to extract him from his JPMorgan contract, two of the people said. Antony Jenkins took over instead. The British retail banker was so far from the usual Wall Street pomp and ferocity that he said during the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2013 gathering in Davos, Switzerland, that Barclays had been too aggressive and self-serving. One Barclays motto under Jenkins was \u201cRISES,\u201d an acronym for respect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship -- ideals emblazoned on see-through blocks at the bank\u2019s Canary Wharf headquarters. A joke circulating among bankers has been that Jenkins should add clients to the list to make \u201cCRISES,\u201d according to two people who work at the unit. Even though Jenkins\u2019s appointment was designed to appease critics, the bank\u2019s past overshadowed his efforts to reform its culture. A year after the 290 million-pound ($445 million) fine for rigging Libor, authorities around the world started probing Barclays for gaming currency markets, culminating in about 1.5 billion pounds of fines in May.\u00a0 Last year Barclays\u2019s investment bank reported a return on equity, a common measure of profitability, of 2.7 percent, down from 8.2 percent in 2013 and less than a fourth of the bank\u2019s 12 percent target. Even with performance improving in the first half of 2015, the unit remains the bank\u2019s least profitable division, trailing credit cards, business in Africa and personal and corporate banking. It also requires the most capital. The bank reports third-quarter results on Thursday. McFarlane, who fired Jenkins in July, has said the   bank can\u2019t compete with its bigger U.S. peers. He\u2019s backed a commitment to keep shrinking the investment bank, which began under former CEO Jenkins, 54. \u201cAll dominant investment banks are North American and are the only ones that can claim to be global and successful,\u201d McFarlane said that month. While some speculate that Staley would represent a return to Diamond\u2019s aggressive style, he supports faster and deeper cuts to the investment bank, especially trading operations outside New York and London, according to a person familiar with his plans for the bank. To emphasize that Staley\u2019s a responsible choice for the bank, McFarlane said last week in London that he\u2019s \u201cnot an investment banker,\u201d even though he ran JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank for three years. McFarlane called him \u201ca client guy\u201d who \u201cstarted out as a commercial banker, like me.\u201d Seven years after taxpayers pledged about 1 trillion pounds to support Britain\u2019s banks, some of the fury is quieting. With the government selling down its stakes in\u00a0Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and\u00a0Lloyds Banking Group Plc, Chancellor of the Exchequer\u00a0George Osborne has backtracked on a plan to assume that senior bankers are guilty until proven innocent and told some of them at a June dinner he\u2019d curtail \u201cever larger\u201d fines. Staley will want regulators and politicians to back him more than they backed Diamond, the man then-Business Secretary Peter Mandelson called \u201cthe unacceptable face of banking.\u201d Back in high school, Staley \u201chad the kind of charisma that only the best politicians possess,\u201d longtime friend John Farmer, a former dean of Rutgers School of Law\u2013Newark, said before Staley\u2019s speech at last year\u2019s A.I.S. award ceremony, according to a video posted online. It mistakenly labels Staley as the former CEO of JPMorgan.","timestamp":1445914807.0,"participant_ids":["BARC:LN","JPM:US"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-27\/staley-s-quest-for-ceo-post-may-be-easier-than-running-barclays","subject":"Staley's Quest for CEO Post May Be Easier Than Running Barclays"},{"body":" Cap Gemini SA agreed to acquire Igate Corp. for about $4 billion, giving Europe\u2019s largest provider of computer services access to more financial customers as it expands in the growing U.S. market for information technology consulting. Igate investors will receive $48 in cash per share, or 4.7 percent more than the stock\u2019s April 24 close in New York, the companies said Monday. Cap Gemini, which is financing the purchase with a mixture of cash, debt and new stock, will add contracts with clients including Royal Bank of Canada and General Electric Co. to boost its annual revenue to 12.5 billion euros ($13.5 billion). Cap Gemini rose 7.9 percent to 84.54 euros in Paris, the stock\u2019s highest closing price in 13 years. Igate gained 3.3 percent to close at $47.36 in New York, reaching a 15-year high. The deal marks a new chapter in the history of Cap Gemini, a competitor to Accenture Plc and International Business Machines Corp., and one of the five biggest computer-services providers in the late 1980s. It is the largest acquisition for the French firm since it bought Ernst & Young\u2019s consulting business 15 years ago for about $10.5 billion. When completed, the deal will add about 33,000 staff to Cap Gemini\u2019s 145,000, and boost the share of employees located in low-cost countries such as India, according to Sagar Rastogi, an analyst at Ambit Capital Pvt. The companies\u2019 industry segments are complementary, with Igate\u2019s two biggest client types -- financial services and industry -- also among Cap Gemini\u2019s top three. The acquisition will help Cap Gemini better challenge low-cost Indian service providers like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd., said Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. European customers \u201care very, very serious about cost rationalization and changing their cost structure,\u201d Rana said. After the deal, Europe will account for no more than half of Cap Gemini\u2019s total sales, Cap Gemini Chief Executive Officer Paul Hermelin said, compared with more than 70 percent last quarter including the U.K. and Ireland. \u201cIt\u2019s a geographic fit,\u201d Hermelin said on a conference call. Cap Gemini\u2019s advance gave the company a market value of 13.8 billion euros. Shares of Accenture and IBM each gained less than 1 percent. The transaction, approved by most Igate shareholders, values the company at about 17 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with a median of 14.6 for similar deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The acquisition adds capacity as well as breadth of coverage areas, Partha Iyengar, Gartner\u2019s head of research India, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe added huge bonus for Cap Gemini is that it gives them a great presence and foothold in the U.S. market, which has always been a challenge for them as a Europe-centric provider.\u201d Cap Gemini struggled in the aftermath of the Internet bubble, turning to extensive restructuring as its credit rating got cut to junk and its stock fell near an all-time low about a decade ago. Standard & Poor\u2019s on Monday cut its long-term corporate credit rating for Cap Gemini to BBB from BBB+, citing the French company\u2019s plan to finance the acquisition primarily with debt. This will \u201cmore than offset the deal\u2019s modestly positive impact\u201d on profitability and business position in the U.S., the ratings company said in a statement. Corporate profits in the U.S. are near record levels, a condition that, coupled with improved business optimism, may drive IT spending for equipment, software and consulting work, according to Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Rana. The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.2 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter, led by the biggest gain in consumer spending in eight years. While the Paris-based company\u2019s sales in North America increased about 12 percent in the first quarter, excluding acquisitions, they fell as much as 16 percent in some European markets like the U.K. and Ireland. Revenue overall grew 1.5 percent during the period, to 2.76 billion euros. \u201cThe North American market is doing really well -- it continues to surprise us in a good way,\u201d Cap Gemini CFO Aiman Ezzat said during the call. Igate, which got about 70 percent of its revenue from the U.S. last year, provides consulting and technology outsourcing services to companies ranging from banks to electronics-manufacturing and chemical companies. The Bridgewater, New Jersey-based company said in January it won 29 new clients, as sales last year increased 10 percent to $1.27 billion, accelerating from 7 percent growth a year earlier. Cap Gemini said the purchase should boost adjusted earnings per share by at least 12 percent in 2016 and 16 percent in 2017. Together, Cap Gemini and Igate would have an operating margin exceeding 10 percent this year. Cap Gemini said the deal will let it accelerate the use of tax losses it has carried forward in North America, resulting in an accretion to normalized earnings per share more than 12 percent next year and 16 percent in 2017.

The board won\u2019t consider talks to sell the company unless it gets an offer of significantly more than $100 a share, Mylan said in a statement Monday. Teva offered $82 a share in cash and stock for Mylan last week. \u201cThe Mylan board concluded the approach did not meet any of the key criteria that would cause the Mylan board to depart from the company\u2019s successful and longstanding standalone strategy, and consider engaging in discussions to sell,\u201d Mylan said. Mylan is instead pursuing a separate hostile $31.2 billion bid for fellow drugmaker Perrigo Co., saying the transaction would be more complementary in terms of products and regional assets. Unlike Teva, which is based in Israel, Mylan and Perrigo have operational headquarters in the U.S. and have moved their tax domiciles to Europe for tax purposes. Mylan shares dropped 5.7 percent to $71.72 at the close in New York, their steepest one-day decline since August 2011. Teva\u2019s American depositary receipts slipped 4.3 percent to $61.63. Perrigo fell 2.4 percent to $188.28. Teva said in a statement that the company was ready to meet with Mylan and quickly complete a deal. In a letter included in Mylan\u2019s statement, Chairman Robert Coury described a meeting with Teva Chief Executive Officer Erez Vigodman in New York last Friday. Coury said the two discussed \u201cTeva\u2019s many struggles throughout the last several years,\u201d including generic competition, turnover in upper management and the search for new sources of growth. Consumer advocates, pharmacists and other groups have expressed concern that a merger of Teva and Mylan would contribute to a trend of rising prices for generic drugs. Some 10 percent of generic drugs doubled in price between July 2013 and June 2014, and half of all generic drugs rose in price, according to an analysis of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid data cited by Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, and Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of these enormous price increases,\u201d Sanders said in a statement last week. \u201cMarket consolidation and less competition in the industry is a possible factor we need to take a look at.\u201d Mylan would only consider a takeover if the acquirer assumed all the regulatory risk, Coury said. Combining with Teva \u201cwould create significant antitrust concerns,\u201d since both are big producers of generic drugs, he said. \u201cFor the sake of your current and future shareholders, employees, patients, customers, communities and other stakeholders, I do hope you find a way to eventually change Teva\u2019s culture and establish credibility in your business dealings,\u201d Coury told Vigodman in the letter. \u201cHowever, we do not wish to make Teva\u2019s problems Mylan\u2019s problems.\u201d Teva said it was already working with antitrust regulators and was confident it could get approval. Vigodman was \u201cdisappointed that Mylan has formally rejected our proposal,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe Teva board and management team are fully committed to completing the combination of Teva and Mylan, and we stand ready to quickly complete a transaction that is compelling for both Teva and Mylan stockholders.\u201d The love triangle developing between Teva, Mylan and Perrigo is adding to what has already been a record period for mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry.

That\u2019s the message from Philippine billionaire Enrique Razon Jr. after casino operator Bloomberry Resorts Corp. tumbled 61 percent this year, making it the nation\u2019s worst-performing major stock. Bloomberry\u2019s losses will narrow because gambling revenue is growing, unlike in Macau, Razon said in an Oct. 2 interview in Manila. He said the company\u2019s earnings will improve and it plans to provision by year-end for all unpaid credit extended to VIP and premium players, he said. Bloomberry provided 1.81 billion pesos ($39 million) in the first half for 4.69 billion pesos of receivables. \u201cThe whole industry has been painted with the same brush, but we\u2019re nowhere near the situation in Macau, where revenue is really falling,\u201d said Razon, 55. Philippine casino operators have plunged in 2015 as an anticipated flood of high-rollers from China failed to materialize amid an anti-corruption drive spearheaded by President Xi Jinping and worsening relations between the two nations. State-run Philippine Amusement & Gaming Corp. predicts casino revenue in the Southeast Asian country may accelerate in the second half after rising 16 percent in the first six months of the year. The Philippine casino market can grow without China through increased spending by mass and local gamblers, Razon said. Bloomberry will still pursue premium players through junket operators instead of doing it directly, he said. \u201cThe good thing now, in hindsight, is that our relationship with China is really not that good,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we never had the business from China, which nowadays is probably a good thing.\u201d As Bloomberry was constructing its Solaire Resort in Manila, tensions between the Philippines and China were building over disputed territories in the South China Sea. The number of Chinese tourists to the country fell by about 33 percent in the first quarter. The company posted a net loss of 773.5 million pesos in the second quarter amid higher operating costs and expenses at Solaire, which opened March 2013. Revenue grew 9.5 percent to 5.99 billion pesos. Growth in casino takings will be subdued unless demand from Chinese gamblers picks up, says Astro del Castillo, managing director at First Grade Finance Inc. \u201cThe environment will remain difficult and investors will remain skeptical as it\u2019s hard to imagine where spectacular growth will come from for Philippine casinos without China, since that\u2019s the region\u2019s biggest source of gaming traffic,\u201d Castillo said. Razon said he expects the mass market to keep growing and account for 60 percent of Bloomberry\u2019s gambling revenue in three to five years. Premium customers from Southeast Asia, Taiwan and South Korea also continue to arrive at Solaire, Razon said. Gross gaming revenue in Macau fell by a third in September, its 16th straight month of declines. Philippine takings from casino operations is forecast to grow 13 percent a year from 2014 to 2017, the highest rate in Asia Pacific, while revenue in Macau is expected to drop by 11 percent during that period, Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a Sept. 28 report. Philippine Amusement & Gaming Chairman Cristino Naguiat said in July the nation\u2019s casino revenue has a \u201cgood chance\" of growing 20 percent to $3 billion this year. Bloomberry jumped 9 percent at the close in Manila, the sharpest gain since April 2012. Travellers International Hotel Group Inc. gained 2.2 percent, while Melco Crown Philippines Resorts Corp. rose 7.8 percent. Bloomberry is also looking overseas for expansion. The company will probably know by December whether its bid to build a casino resort in South Korea\u2019s Incheon Free Economic Zone is successful, while a casino venture in the North Asian country\u2019s Jeju Island may start making money next year, Razon said.

Adelson, the 81-year-old billionaire founder and chairman of Las Vegas Sands Corp., is among the casino operator\u2019s top executives listed as witnesses for a hearing starting Monday in a lawsuit brought by Steven Jacobs, the former chief executive officer of the company\u2019s Macau unit. Jacobs hasn\u2019t had a chance during the 4 1\/2-year-old Nevada case to put his ex-boss on the witness stand. He claims he was fired for balking at what he says were illegal demands, including to dig up information about high-ranking Macau government officials that, according to a court filing, could be used to \u201cexert leverage.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s going to be mudslinging,\u201d said Greg Doll, a lawyer at Doll Amir & Eley LLP in Los Angeles who isn\u2019t involved in the case. \u201cYou can bet your bottom dollar that Jacobs is going to bring up stuff that is uncomfortable for Sands China and for Adelson in particular.\u201d Adelson denies allegations he ordered secret investigations into the business and financial affairs of government officials, as well as Jacobs\u2019s claim that he personally approved a strategy condoning prostitution at the Macau casinos. Sands has said in court filings that Jacobs was dismissed for working on unauthorized deals and violating company policy. Macau casinos saw their first drop in annual revenue last year as the Chinese economy slowed and President Xi Jinping expanded his battle to curb corruption in the ruling Communist Party. Xi\u2019s campaign against illegal money transfers by gamblers, now in its third year, has hurt sales of luxury goods and kept away high rollers who helped the former Portuguese colony\u2019s   grow to about seven times the size of the Las Vegas Strip. Adelson called Jacobs\u2019s allegations \u201coutright lies and fabrications\u201d in a statement reported by the Wall Street Journal, spurring Jacobs to add a defamation claim against him in the Nevada lawsuit. Las Vegas Sands said in a January court filing that Jacobs is using the lawsuit as a \u201cplatform to denigrate and defame\u201d the company and its chairman. Ron Reese, a Sands spokesman, declined to comment before the hearing. Adelson has said in court filings that the investigation of Macau officials, which Jacobs alleges Adelson requested, was actually commissioned by Jacobs and that he didn\u2019t learn about it until after Jacobs had been fired. \u201cI never asked or authorized Jacobs to conduct a private investigation of or \u2018create a dossier\u2019 on Macanese officials,\u201d Adelson said in a March 2013 declaration. \u201cWe believe unequivocally that Jacobs initiated the investigation on his own for his own purposes.\u201d Adelson, the world\u2019s 25th richest person, has testified about his aversion to out-of-court settlements. The feud with Jacobs is playing out in state court in Las Vegas after Sands China Ltd. embarked on a \u201cNever Settle\u201d advertising campaign featuring former Manchester United and Real Madrid soccer superstar David Beckham. Jacobs won court permission to cite as evidence the work of a Hong Kong-based risk consultant who looked at alleged ties between Sands China business associates and organized crime. According to court filings, one report, commissioned by the company, involved an alleged organized crime figure who was operating VIP rooms in casinos on the island. The second, also commissioned by the company, concerned a Hong Kong movie producer with alleged ties to a triad. The report on Macau officials was the third one, with Jacobs and Adelson disputing who commissioned it. Jacobs said in court filings, without disclosing the consultant\u2019s findings, that the reports will expose the company to \u201cserious political and legal problems.\u201d He is seeking to enter them as evidence at the hearing. The company has said Jacobs stole the reports and that they contain \u201cextremely sensitive, highly confidential information.\u201d In January, J. Randall Jones, a lawyer for Sands China,   Jacobs\u2019s use of them in the lawsuit. \u201cIn some cases, they would call this blackmail,\u201d Jones said. Todd Bice, a lawyer for Jacobs, told the judge Sands wants to keep them out of the case because they are embarrassing and contradict Adelson\u2019s public statements. Jacobs has said in court filings that he took the reports from the company when he left and returned the originals after Sands\u2019 lawyers requested them. Bice didn\u2019t respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking comment before Monday\u2019s hearing. Adelson sued Jacob for defamation in Florida, where Jacobs lives. Jacobs won dismissal of that case and Sands told the court last year it would appeal the ruling. Jacobs also defeated Sands\u2019 attempt to remove Nevada District Court Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez from the case over claims she\u2019s biased against the company. Sands China sought the judge\u2019s removal after she ruled the company won\u2019t be allowed to call any witnesses at the hearing. She imposed that sanction in March over what she saw as its foot-dragging on sharing evidence with Jacobs. The Nevada Supreme Court rejected efforts to disqualify the judge. Formally, the hearing will address the narrow legal question of whether Sands China, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and listed on the Hong Kong exchange, can be sued in Nevada. Jacobs says the reports, along with other evidence, will show Adelson and Las Vegas Sands controlled the Macau operations, including ordering the investigations there. Sands China contends Jacobs shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sue it in Nevada because the Macau unit doesn\u2019t do business there. The Nevada Supreme Court told Gonzalez in 2011 that the case couldn\u2019t move forward until that question was resolved, leading to years of haggling over what evidence Jacobs could gather and use. Keeping the claims against the Macau company in the U.S. is important for Jacobs because he\u2019s trying to recover 2.5 million Sands China stock options, which would be harder to collect if he\u2019s forced to bring a separate lawsuit overseas, Doll said. There\u2019s no telling who will win the hearing because both sides have strong arguments on the jurisdiction issue, said Doll, who reviewed the court filings. Jacobs seeks to show Sands China is directly run by the Las Vegas-based parent company and that his case belongs in Nevada state court. Jacobs lists e-mails and other documents he expects to use as evidence for his allegations that Adelson was calling the shots for the Macau casinos. Jacobs claims Adelson prevented him in June 2010 from disclosing to Sands China\u2019s board the consultant\u2019s findings related to allegations that the company was involved with Chinese organized crime groups. He also sought to tell the board that Adelson wanted to rehire a Macau lawyer who had requested a $300 million payment for government officials in China, which created a risk under U.S. anti-bribery laws, according to court filings. \u201cAdelson reminded Jacobs that he was both the chairman and the controlling shareholder and that Jacobs should \u2018do as I please,\u2019\u201d according to an amended complaint Jacobs filed last year. \u201cIndeed, on a prior occasion when Jacobs had voiced his concern over how Nevada\u2019s gaming regulators might view Adelson\u2019s actions, Adelson scoffed at the suggestion, informing Jacobs that he, Adelson, controlled the regulators, not the other way around.\u201d In March Adelson became chief executive officer of Sands China. The casinos in Macau provide about two-thirds of Las Vegas Sands\u2019 revenue. Adelson, a Boston native, has a net worth of $27.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He currently owns 48 percent of Las Vegas Sands, the world\u2019s biggest casino operator, which in turn is the majority owner of Sands China. He\u2019s been reluctant to settle lawsuits, testifying in a 2013 trial with a Hong Kong businessman, who claimed he wasn\u2019t paid for helping Sands win a license to operate casinos in Macau, that there would be a line around the block with people suing him if he didn\u2019t defend the claims. Adelson lost that trial and is appealing the $101.6 million judgment against Sands. It was the   the case went to a jury after the Nevada Supreme Court reversed an earlier $58.7 million judgment in favor of the businessman, Richard Suen. Jacobs said in his lawsuit that he \u201csaved the Titanic\u201d when Adelson hired him in 2009 to run Sands\u2019 casinos in Macau by, among other things, repairing relations with local and national government officials who no longer would meet with Adelson \u201cdue to his obstreperous behavior.\u201d He claims that in his first year on the job, he started \u201cOperation Clean Sweep\u201d to rid the casino floor of loan sharks and prostitutes, only to be told by senior Las Vegas Sands executives that the existing \u201cprostitution strategy\u201d had been a success. Sands said in a 2012 court filing that Jacobs\u2019s allegation that Adelson approved a prostitution strategy is \u201cdemonstrably false.\u201d \u201cMr Adelson regards prostitution as morally abhorrent,\u201d Sands said. \u201cIn his business, Mr. Adelson has consistently opposed allowing prostitution, regardless of any financial calculations.\u201d The case is Jacobs v.

The federal agency late Tuesday   the for-profit college chain $30 million, finding that its Heald business schools had misled students about job-placement rates. In making the announcement, the agency said it was setting up a system to accept fraud claims and requests for forgiveness -- the first time it has done so on a mass scale. The department has received demands from at least 250 students to have their loans forgiven as borrowers staged what they called a \u201cdebt strike,\u201d according to an agency official who asked not to be identified because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. The government has received only half a dozen such claims over the last 15 years, the official said. Under federal regulations, students may have their loans forgiven in the event of fraud. Corinthian, based in Santa Ana, California, called the government\u2019s conclusions \u201chighly questionable.\u201d \u201cWhen our borrowers bring claims to us that their school committed fraud or other violations of state law against them, we will give them the relief that they are entitled to under federal law and regulations,\u201d Under Secretary Ted Mitchell said in a statement. It\u2019s unclear how many former students will get relief and whether borrowers from years ago will qualify. The government will consider each borrower claim on a case-by-case basis and students will have to prove both that they have been defrauded and injured by misstatements, the official said. Corinthian\u2019s Heald College misstated 947 placement rates that inflated the employment prospects of graduates, the Education Department said Tuesday. Heald paid temporary agencies to hire its graduates to work at jobs on its own campuses for as little as two days and counted them as employed, the department said. It also counted placements outside students\u2019 field of study, such as an accounting graduate working at a Taco Bell restaurant, according to the agency. The department ordered Heald to stop enrolling students and made two of its campuses ineligible for financial aid. Heald, which offers degrees related to business, law and technology, has 12 colleges across the Western U.S., according to its website. The government\u2019s findings amount to unproven allegations, Joe Hixson, a spokesman for Corinthian, said in an e-mail. The Education Department appears to be using at least partially flawed data in its analysis, and the company plans to contest the decision, he said. \u201cTo date the process surrounding the government\u2019s actions toward Corinthian has had the order, civility and due process of a 16th century witch hunt,\u201d Hixson said. Corinthian, owner of the Everest, Heald and WyoTech for-profit schools, collapsed last summer after the Education Department delayed its access to federal student aid. In November, the company agreed to sell half of its 107 campuses to Education Credit Management Corp., a nonprofit company specializing in debt collection, amid allegations that its schools falsified grades, attendance and job-placement rates. The sale effectively kept the schools open, so the government didn\u2019t have to reimburse students. Corinthian received $1.4 billion in federal aid in 2013 alone. A group of students calling itself the Corinthian 100 vowed not to repay their loans and have met with members of Congress and the Education Department to make their case. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has led colleagues in calling foul on the Corinthian sale. Catrina Beverly, 34, earned an associate\u2019s degree in medical- office administration from Heald last year, taking on $28,000 in debt. She\u2019s still working at a call center, the job she had before she attended Heald and said the career-placement center hasn\u2019t been helpful. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t worked out very well,\u201d said Beverly, who lives in Antioch, California. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself moving beyond a call-center environment.\u201d Beverly stopped paying her federal loans about six months ago and said she filed for relief with the Education Department. While Corinthian doesn\u2019t comment on specific students, it employs about one full-time career services counselor for every 100 students, Hixson said. Under  , schools lose their eligibility for government-backed student aid if they file for bankruptcy or are determined in a judicial process to have committed fraud involving federal funds. If a college closes, students and recent graduates are eligible for reimbursement. While neither Corinthian nor its employees have been convicted of a crime, the company self-reported multiple incidents of fraud to the Education Department, according to regulatory filings. It has since called the reports \u201cisolated instances.\u201d The company settled a lawsuit brought by California\u2019s attorney general in 2007 without admitting wrongdoing and is being sued again there and in Massachusetts. It\u2019s been under investigation in 20 states and faces federal   in three states. Corinthian schools in California, including Heald, weren\u2019t part of the sale to Education Credit Management. The state\u2019s Attorney General Kamala Harris refused to sign off on the deal, preferring to pursue restitution for students. \u201cI applaud the Department of Education for taking strong action to hold Heald College accountable for its egregious misconduct,\u201d Harris said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cI urge the department to act quickly to relieve these students from their student loan debt burdens.\u201d","timestamp":1429110895.0,"participant_ids":["COCO:US","6927069Z:AU"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-15\/corinthian-debt-strikers-may-get-relief-on-u-s-student-loans","subject":"Student\u00a0Debt\u00a0Strikers Are\u00a0Demanding\u00a0Loan Relief, and May Get It"},{"body":" Philippine billionaire Enrique Razon will buy an island in South Korea to develop a leisure and tourism complex, as he taps the country\u2019s growth in gambling on rising tourist arrivals from China. Bloomberry Resorts Corp., controlled by Razon and operator of a casino in Manila, will buy the 21-hectare (52-acre) Silmi Island through unit Solaire Korea Co., according to a Philippine Stock Exchange filing on Tuesday. It\u2019s Bloomberry\u2019s second announcement of a property purchase in the country this year after the company signed in January four deals with landowners on Korea\u2019s Muui Island, which is adjacent to Silmi Island. Asian casino operators including Bloomberry are   on a downturn in the gambling industry of Macau as China\u2019s corruption crackdown scares many away from the world\u2019s biggest gambling hub. Macau casino revenue fell last year for the first time and may decline another 8 percent this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. In contrast, gambling revenue in South Korea and the Philippines will grow 16 percent and 33 percent respectively this year, gaining from the spillover of Chinese gamblers, Deutsche Bank analyst Karen Tang wrote in a note in January. About 6.1 million mainland travelers went to South Korea last year, an increase of 42 percent, according to   from the Korea Tourism Organization. Solaire Korea also signed a deal with shareholders of Golden & Luxury Co. to buy as much as 92 percent of the company, which owns and operates T.H.E. Hotel & Vegas Casino on Korea\u2019s Jeju Island, Bloomberry said in a separate statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe are excited at the prospect of Solaire setting up a base in Korea,\u201d Razon said in the statement. \u201cThis is our first venture outside of the Philippines, and the possibilities for expansion in this country are promising.\u201d Bloomberry rose 0.8 percent to 10.64 pesos as of 2:55 p.m. in Manila trading after gaining as much as 2.3 percent.

With a government crackdown on corruption in China scaring customers away from Macau, where gaming revenue has fallen year-on-year for four straight quarters, the opportunity appeared to be there for other Asian gambling hubs to cash in. Instead, the anticipated flood of high-rollers from China to Manila\u2019s three casino resorts has so far failed to materialize. The market value of operators like Melco Crown Philippines Resorts Corp. and Bloomberry Resorts Corp. has been shredded as investors fled, making Philippine casino stocks among the world\u2019s worst performers this year. Profits will tumble 56 percent across the industry in 2016, JPMorgan Chase & Co. forecast this week. \u201cThe chain reaction from Macau hit everyone,\u201d said Noel Reyes, chief investment officer at Security Bank Corp., who manages the best-performing Philippine equity fund in the past year. \u201cExpectations VIP players will come in large numbers didn\u2019t happen. The stocks have fallen quite significantly but not everyone is rushing back in, and there\u2019s no clear light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d Casino shares have crashed even as the benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index has climbed 4.4 percent this year, peaking at a record high in April amid official   for two straight years of 8 percent economic growth. Shares of Bloomberry, which operates Solaire, have lost 27 percent this year, and Resorts World Manila operator Travellers International Hotel Group Inc. has slumped 35 percent. Melco Crown Philippines tumbled 56 percent as earnings disappointed investors, outpacing even the 36 percent loss at Wynn Macau Ltd., the Chinese territory\u2019s worst-performing casino stock. Bloomberry added 0.8 percent to 9.08 pesos at the close of trade in Manila, paring a gain of as much as 2 percent, while Travellers was unchanged. Melco advanced as much as 3.8 percent before closing unchanged at 6.01 pesos, the lowest level since December 2012. JPMorgan Chase & Co. downgraded Melco\u2019s stock to underweight from overweight in a report dated June 21, and cut its 12-month price target by 63 percent to 5.80 pesos. Arrivals to the Philippines from China, the country\u2019s fourth-biggest tourist market, fell by about 33 percent to 93,043 in the first quarter as the Chinese government stepped up its anti-corruption drive. A simmering territorial dispute between the two nations over islands in the South China Sea also deterred travelers. Geopolitics \u201cseems to be getting in the way of seeing planeloads of tourists,\u201d Cristino Naguiat, chief executive officer of the Philippine Amusement & Gaming industry body, said earlier this month. Bloomberry fell to a first-quarter loss of 533 million pesos (11.8 million) as costs spiked with the expansion of the Solaire casino, increased marketing expenses and provision for bad debts. Travellers\u2019s profit rose 1.6 percent to 1.74 billion pesos, while Melco Crown Philippines, which opened City of Dreams in December, posted a record 3.09 billion-peso loss. \u201cThe first-quarter results raised the question; can there be aggressive growth without the numbers coming from China?\u201d said Richard Laneda, an analyst at COL Financial Group Inc. in Manila. \u201cThe growth in earnings didn\u2019t match the pace most wanted to see. The market isn\u2019t overreacting, there\u2019s genuine uncertainty.\u201d Some investors are overestimating the impact of the China market, and the slump in Philippine gaming stocks is excessive, according to Marc Reyes-Lao, an analyst at BPI Securities Corp. in Manila. Combined profit at Bloomberry, Travellers and Melco Crown Philippines is forecast to jump 47 percent to 13.61 billion pesos next year from 2015, and to 15.59 billion pesos in 2017, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

The 11-year contract provides Michigan $12 million up front, $76.8 million in cash paid over the life of the deal\u00a0and $80.2 million in apparel, according to the university. It begins in August 2016 and includes a school option for four additional years. The agreement eclipses the 10-year contract that Notre Dame signed with Under Armour Inc. worth more than $90 million, previously the most expensive apparel deal in college sports history. Michigan had been an Adidas AG school. A member of the Big Ten Conference, Michigan is one of college sports\u2019 \u201ctop tier\u201d brands and one of its biggest merchandise sellers, said Bob Dorfman, executive creative director at Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco. He added that the recent success of the men\u2019s basketball team and recent hiring of Jim Harbaugh as football coach bode well for the department\u2019s future. \u201cAt the least, it will bring them extra heavy coverage -- and huge swoosh exposure -- over the next few years,\u201d Dorfman said in an e-mail.

Michigan\u2019s eight-year deal with Adidas, which expires in June 2016, was worth an average of at least $6.85 million\u00a0per year. The contract gave Michigan the option of extending for an additional five years, which the university declined. Chris McGuire, director of sports marketing at Adidas, told the   in May that Adidas wanted to re-sign with Michigan. He called the Ann Arbor school the \u201cflagship\u201d of the Adidas stable. \u201cWe have great partners in the college sector, like Miami and UCLA, but we look to Michigan to drive our brand,\u201d McGuire said, according to the newspaper. \u201cMichigan is still the crown jewel.\u201d Notre Dame Notre Dame had been with Adidas for 17 years before signing with Under Armour. The South Bend, Indiana, school\u2019s Under Armour contract included an equity option, the details of which were not announced.

The shares slipped 4.4 percent on Wednesday to $15.94, helping lead a decline in a Bloomberg index of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. Macau casino stocks had closed lower in Hong Kong earlier in the trading day after Deutsche Bank said the gaming sector was hurt last week due to a move by junket operators to reduce credit offered to high-end gamblers. A government crackdown on corruption combined with an economic slowdown in China has curbed spending by high rollers in Macau, the world\u2019s biggest gambling hub. Gross gaming revenue fell 19 percent to 493 million patacas ($62 million) a day last week, or 18 percent below the average so far this quarter, Deutsche Bank analyst Karen Tang wrote in a note Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a group issue of Macau casinos where there remains a lot of concern about when and at what level the gaming business will reach an inflection point,\u201d Tim Craighead,\u00a0a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in an e-mail. \u201cOverall, the transition from a VIP-driven business to a mass-market oriented one is one that will take time.\u201d Revenue was hurt last week due to a move by junket operators to reduce credit offered to high-end gamblers.

The Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF dropped for a second day, sliding 0.2 percent to $32.53. That followed the Shanghai Composite Index which dropped 2.2 percent on Wednesday, while Chinese stocks trading in Hong Kong fell the most in three weeks after a preliminary manufacturing gauge for the mainland unexpectedly fell to a six-year low.

Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd., headed by Ho and his Australian billionaire partner James Packer, yesterday said it plans to woo vacationing Chinese with a family entertainment center it will open with Time Warner Inc. at its new $3.2 billion Macau casino. This is part of the company\u2019s plan to shift resources away from high rollers, Ho said. Casino operators including Melco, Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. and Sands China Ltd. are targeting mass market gamblers from China as the city diversifies its economy that largely relies on casino gambling for government revenue. Macau suffered the   in 2014 as Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-graft drive turned away high-end players who contributed to a majority of the city\u2019s gambling takings. \u201cIf you look at China, how many more billionaires are going to drop out of trees in the next 10 years?\u201d Ho, Melco\u2019s chief executive officer and co-chairman, said in an interview in Macau yesterday. \u201cIt is going to be the rise of the middle income earnings demographics. These are the younger people who want to travel, experience the world.\u201d Melco rose 1.2 percent to close at HK$63.2 in Hong Kong trading today. Galaxy led the rally in other casino stocks with shares up 2.7 percent and SJM Holdings Ltd. gained 2.6 percent and Sands China advanced 2.3 percent. Ho, the son of 93-year-old Macau gambling mogul Stanley Ho, expects the casino industry to recover in the second half of the year and end 2015 with growth in the \u201clow- to mid-single digits,\u201d boosted by Melco\u2019s Studio City and other openings this year, he said to Bloomberg Television\u2019s Angie Lau in Macau yesterday. Galaxy will open the second phase of its Cotai project in the middle of this year. Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG estimated Macau casino revenue in 2015 to fall 8 percent and 6 percent respectively. CLSA Ltd. and Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst have predicted a 9 percent and 10 percent decline respectively. Jefferies LLC forecast a 3 percent growth. Macau\u2019s government has been curbing money flows to the territory over concern that illegal funds are being taken out of the mainland. It\u2019s restricting the use of China UnionPay Co.\u2019s debit cards at casinos and tightening rules on junket operators, the middlemen that provide credit and arrange trips for Chinese high rollers. Ho said he hasn\u2019t seen any further restrictions and that China\u2019s anti-corruption campaign \u201cis directed at government officials\u201d which is affecting consumption appetite of people from the mainland. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to stay low profile,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce people figure out what the new normal is, then ultimately the population base and the consumption power is so great that it\u2019s all going to come back,\u201d Ho said. \u201cThe problem is nobody knows what is the new normal right now.\u201d Melco Crown is building a 30,000-square-foot (2,787-square-meter) Warner Bros. Family Entertainment Center that will include a virtual reality Batman ride and other facilities featuring DC Comics characters such as \u201cSuperman,\u201d \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cThe Flash,\u201d the company said. Melco\u2019s Studio City, inspired by Hollywood, is scheduled to open in the third quarter, Ho said at a media briefing yesterday in Macau. The company aims to start with 400 gambling tables and 1,600 rooms from two hotel towers at the resort located in the increasingly popular Cotai area in Macau, he said. The company hopes Macau will allow it to put more gambling tables with such non-gaming elements at the new resort in line with government guidelines, he said. Chinese president Xi had called on Macau, the only Chinese city that legally allows casino gambling, to nurture new growth areas and turn the city into a world tourism and leisure center. \u201cWe think Melco\u2019s announcement will be viewed by the government as a step in the right direction,\u201d Karen Tang, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a report. \u201cThat said, visibility on table quota remains murky.\u201d The new casino will have a 130-meter tall Ferris wheel, inspired by the film\u2019s two asteroids shooting through a Gotham City building, according to the company. It will have a nightclub, a television broadcast studio and a 5,000-seat center for concerts, sports and theatrical events, it said. Almost 2 million mainland tourists visited the former Portuguese colony in November, an increase of 28 percent and 70 percent of the total, according to  Melco Crown said Jan. 2 that it will delist from the Hong Kong stock exchange because of low trading volume and significant additional costs, while keeping its Nasdaq listing. The move isn\u2019t related to the Macau gambling slowdown nor China\u2019s anti-graft campaign, and Melco \u201cwill take a look at\u201d the possibility of restructuring casino assets for relisting in Hong Kong if big enough properties come along, Ho said.","timestamp":1421131674.0,"participant_ids":["MPEL:US","27:HK"],"message_id":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-01-12\/melco-will-use-batman-to-woo-visitors-at-new-macau-casino","subject":"Melco Bets on Batman to Help Macau Casinos Sales Rebound"},{"body":"     (Bloomberg) -- Retail sales in the U.S., where consumer spending accounts for almost 70 percent of the economy, probably cooled in December, data this week may show.

The American depositary receipts fell 1.7 percent to $21.03. Shenzhen-based iDreamsky Technology Co., a mobile-game publishing platform, plunged 33 percent, the most since it debuted in August, to $7.22. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index rose 0.2 percent to 109.13. Gambling in Macau has slumped as high rollers, who account for about two-thirds of revenue, were dissuaded from playing there amid concern President Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-graft campaign will attract scrutiny and after the government tightened visa rules. Chinese consumers also cut spending as the economy expands at the slowest pace in 24 years. Morgan Stanley reduced Melco Crown from the equivalent of buy, projecting a 25 percent drop in gaming sales in Macau this year. \u201cThe primary drivers have been the government crackdown and tighter credit,\u201d Matthew Jacob, a director at ITG Investment Research in New York, said by phone. \u201cTrends aren\u2019t getting any better. The rhetoric we have seen is that the government will get even more strict.\u201d Visitor arrivals at Macau, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal, fell 1.5 percent in January, according to data released by the Macau Statistics and Census Service. Traffic into Macau may dwindle further as the government said in January it intends to impose a full smoking ban on all areas at casinos. A VIP-room smoking ban this year would further weaken gaming profits in Macau, Jacob said. Private high-roller rooms are currently exempted from a smoking ban already implemented in other casino areas. Melco Crown, controlled by Lawrence Ho and Australian billionaire James Packer, has declined 17 percent this year in New York, compared with a 0.1 percent drop in the Bloomberg index of the most-actively traded Chinese companies in the U.S. Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Inc. cut iDreamsky to hold from buy and Piper Jaffrey lowered its price target to $24 from $30.
