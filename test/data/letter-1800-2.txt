[^FROM DANIEL DEFOE^]
My Lord
   I am Very Unhappy Not in My Private Affairs Only, which are
Melancholy, and Ruinous, from the Discontinuance of your
Favour, But in Not having The Occasion and Honour of Layeing
before your Lordship Several Matters of Importance Relating to the
Public.
   I had Once My Lord The honour of your Promise That if I did
any Thing Offensive you would be your Self my Reprover, and
would not be Dissobliged Till I had first your Mind for my
Government. God is My Witness if I knew any Thing in which I
Should Dissplease your Lordship I would Avoid it Dilligently. If my
Lord I am Not So Useful a Servant as I would be, I hope I have
been Useful, and still May be So, and it must be want of
Opportunity Not fidelity or Diligence if it is Otherwise.
   I Humbly Lay my Case at your Lordship's Feet. Your Lordship knows and
I Presume Remembers That when your Lordship Honoured me with your
Recommendation to The Late Lord Treasurer, My Lord Offered Me a
Very Good Post in Scotland and afterward Offered me to be
Comissionr of The Customs There, and That I did Not Refuse
Those Offers, but it being your Opinion as well as his Lordship's
That I Might be More Serviceable in a Private Capascity, I Chose
Rather to Depend Upon her Majesty's Goodness That I Might be Most
Serviceable, Than to
<P 332>
Secure My Family a Maintenance and be Rendered Incapable to serve
her Majesty's Interest.
   Since My Lord I had The honour of Returning into your Lordship's
Service and Protection, your Lordship was pleased to Speak for me to
her Majesty and to Assure me her Majesty had been pleased to
Appoint the Paymt of My Pension, and your Lordship had the Goodness
to Supply me The first quarter. Had I Not My Lord The
Importuneing Circumstance of a Large Family, a Wife and Six
Children, I could Serve your Lordship Twenty year without the Least
Supply Rather Than Thus press upon your Goodness, But my Lord -
My Weakness Permits me to Say No More. A Family Often Ruined and
Now Depending Upon your Lordship's Goodness presses me beyond
Measure. I humbly Ask your Lordship's Pardon for it.
May it Please your Lordship
   I am your Daily Petitioner for an Opportunity in but Six
words to Lay before your Lordship Some Things Relating to New
Uneasynesses in Scotland,
   Something Relating to The Trade to the South Seas, which
abundance speak Evil of because They do Not Understand, 
   And something Relating to The Poor keel men at New Castle
whose Oppressions Seem Reserved for your Lordship's hand to put an
End to - I beg a few Minutes at your Leisure, and Am
   My Lord, Your Lordship's Most Humble & Obedient Servant
