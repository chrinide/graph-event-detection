September 8. 1760
Dear Sr
   I have received ye Papers - And how greatly am I concerned, that
I can not take ye advantage of ye infinite pains you have taken
for me? But every day puts it more, & more out of my power -
   It is with difficulty that I can read what your Friend[{shi{]p, &
Genius, & Virtue, has sent me: But still greater difficulty am
I under sufficiently to thank you for it. - To write is Uneasy
to me; must I despair of ever seeing you? Or have I that pleasure
in life still to come? - Success, & Peace, be ever with You!
   Amen.
which is ye natural Style of those that have entered the Intermediate
state between this scene, & ye next: A dim Apartment it is, which
excludes Action, but favours Thought.
[\WRITTEN VERTICALLY IN THE LEFT MARGIN\] Heaven be favourable
to Miss Pattys health!
