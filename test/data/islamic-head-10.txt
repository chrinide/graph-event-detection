1	1	On the hadeeth of Najd	abuz-zubair	Abuz Zubair	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IslamicAwakening.Com Discussion Board: Islaam in general: Topics started in July 2000: On the hadeeth of Najd -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- By UmNusayba on Friday, September 08, 2000 - 12:09 am: Edit By UmNusaybah on Sunday, July 2, 2000 - 03:46 pm: assalaamu 'alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu Insha'Allaah this should clarify some of the misconceptions surrounding the well known hadeeth of Najd. The Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said, "O Allaah bestow your blessings on our Shaam. O Allaah bestow your blessings on our Yemen." The people said, "O Messenger of Allaah, and our Najd." I think the third time the Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam,said "There (in Najd) will occur earthquakes, trials and tribulations, and from their appears the Horn of Satan." Reported in al-Bukhaaree [Book of Trials, Chpt. ‘The afflictions will come from the East’ 9/166 no. 214 Eng. Trans] A hadeeth which has some controversy surrounding it due to obvious sectarian reasons. A hadeeth which has been (deliberately)misunderstood by certain groups of people in order that they may spread their misguidance and deceive ignorant Muslims. This because upon research and investigation and looking to the words of our early scholars we find that this hadeeth does not refer to the Najd that is famously known in Saudi today, but rather it refers to Iraaq. About two years ago I read a book entirely devoted to this hadeeth entitled, "an-Najd Qarnu ash-Shaytaan" [I cannot remember the author as I do not have the book on me anymore.] I will quote in general from what I remember from this book, and refrain from mentioning precise quotes except from those references that I have on me. Amongst the scholars that are mentioned who referred this hadeeth to Iraaq were: al-Khattaabee, al-Kirmaanee, al-Aynee, an-Nawawee, Ibn Hajr and others. The reasons behind this are numerous and clear: 1) The generality of the hadeeth pertaining to the fitna coming from the east. Al-Bukhaaree includes this hadeeth in the chapter: "The affliction will appear from the East" 212) From the father of Saalim: The Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, stood up besides the pulpit (and pointed towards the east) and said: "Afflictions are there! Afflictions are there! From where appears the horn of Satan" or he said, "the horn of the Sun" 213) From ibn Umar that he said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alyahi wa sallam, saying while facing the east: "Indeed Afflictions are there, from where appears the Horn of Satan." 214) The hadeeth of Najd under discussion. Similar ahaadeeth can be found in Saheeh Muslim (volume 4 no’s 6938+). Ahaadeeth that give the same meaning can be found in Saheeh Muslim (volume 1 no’s 83+) 2) That the generality of the early trials and tribulations arose from the east, many of them actually in Iraaq itself. Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee said after quoting the words of al-Khattaabee explaining the meaning of Qarn (horn), "and others have said that the People of the East were disbelievers at that time and the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, informed us that the trials and tribulations would arise from that direction and it was as he said. And the first of the trials that arose, arose from the direction of the east and they were the reason for the splitting of the Muslim ranks, and this is what Satan loves and delights in. Likewise the innovations appeared from that direction." [Fath al-Baaree 13/58 in commentary to the hadeeth of Najd] Amongst the trials that arose in Iraaq and the east was the martyrdom of Alee, the martyrdom of the grandson of the Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, the first battle between the Muslims occurred in Iraaq, and many more. Imaam Nawawee mentions that one of the greatest trials to appear from the East will be the appearance of the Dajjaal. [Sharh Saheeh Muslim 2/29] From the innovations that appeared in the east and specifically Iraaq, were many of the early deviant sects amongst them the Qadariyyah (as the first hadeeth in Muslim shows), the Jahmiyyah and their offshoots etc… 3. That at the time of the Prophet, sallaahu alayhis wa sallaam, there were 13 places known as Najd [according to ‘Najd Qarn ash-Shaytaan’] depending on where one was. This because Najd linguistically means a raised/elevated land. Therefore the Arabs referred to lands that were elevated with respect to them as Najd. One of the most commonly referred to areas as Najd at that time was Iraaq. 4. The Najd for those people living in Madeenah in the direction of the East would be Iraaq. Ibn Hajr said: "al-Khattaabee said: ‘the najd in the direction of the east, and for the one who is in Madeenah then his Najd would be the desert of Iraaq and it’s regions [baadiya al-Iraaq wa Nawaaheehaa] for this is to the east of the People of Madeenah. The basic meaning of Najd is that which is raised/elevated from the earth in contravention to al-Gawr for that is what is lower than it. Tihaamah [the coastal plain along the south-western and southern shores of the Arabian Peninsula] is entirely al-Gawr and Mecca is in Tihaamah.’" Ibn Hajr continues, "by this [saying of al-Khattaabee] the weakness of the saying of ad-Daawodee is understood that ‘Najd is in the direction of Iraaq’ [min Naahiya al-Iraaq] for he suggests that Najd is a specific place. This is not the case, rather everything that is elevated with respect to what adjoins it is called Najd and the lower area called Gawr."[Fath al-Baaree 13/58-59] Al-Haafidh al-Mubaarakfooree endorses these words in his commentary to Sunan at-Tirmidhee (10/314 no.4212) 5. The hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim [4/1505 no.6943] Saalim bin Abdullaah bin Umar said: O people of Iraaq, how strange is it that you ask about the minor sins but commit the major sins? [The killing of al-Husayn] I heard my father,Abdullaah bin Umar narrating that he heard the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, saying while pointing his hand to the east: "Indeed the turmoil would come from this side, from where appear the horns of Satan and you would strike the necks of one another…" 6. The variations in wording of the hadeeth of Najd that leave no doubt whatsoever as to what it refers to. The hadeeth of ibn Umar Reported by Abu Nu`aym in al-Hilya (6/133), "O Allaah bestow your blessings on our Madeenah, and bestow your blessings on our Mecca, and bestow your blessings on our Shaam, and bestow your blessings on our Yemen, and bestow your blessings in our measuring (fee saa`inaa wa muddinaa)." A person said, " O Messenger of Allaah and in our Iraaq" and so he turned away from him and said, "there will occur earthquakes, trials and tribulations and there will appear the horn of Satan." Shu`ayb al-Arna`ut declares it’s isnaad to be saheeh as in his footnotes to ‘Sharh as-Sunnah’ (14/206-207 fn. 2) and he too endorses the words of al-Khattaabee quoted above. The hadeeth of ibn Umar reported in at-Tabaraanee in ‘al-Awsat’ that the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam prayed Fajr and then faced the people and said, "O Allaah bestow your blessings on our Madeenah, O Allaah bestow your blessings in our measuring, O Allaah bestow your blessings in our Shaam and our Yemen." A person said, "And Iraaq O Messenger of Allaah?" He said, "from there arises the horn of Satan and the trials and tribulations would come like mounting waves." Ibn Hajr al-Haythamee says in his ‘Mujma az-Zawaa`id’ (3/305 – chapter ‘collection of du`aas made for (Madeenah)’): ‘its narrators are trustworthy and precise.’ [This hadeeth could possibly considered to be the same as b) above, but I have included it separately due to the slight difference in wording. Allaah knows best.] The hadeeth of ibn Abbaas reported by at-Tabaraanee in ‘al-Kabeer’ that the Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, supplicated and said, "O Allaah bestow your blessings on our Shaam and Yemen." A person from amongst the people said, "O Prophet of Allaah and Iraaq?" He said, "indeed there is the Horn of Satan, and the trials and tribulations will come like mounting waves, and indeed harshness/coarseness is in the east." Al-Haythamee says: "it’s narrators are trustworthy and precise." (ibid.) 7. The virtues of Bani Tameem Bani Tameem constitute the majority of the inhabitants of the Najd that is in Saudi Arabia. The hadeeth of Saheeh Bukhaaree reported by Abu Hurayra (RA): "I have loved the people of the tribe of Bani Tameem, ever since I heard three things the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said about them. I heard him saying, ‘these people (of the tribe of Bani Tameem) would stand firm against the Dajjaal.’ When the Saddaqat from that tribe came, the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said, "these are the Saddaqat (charitable gifts) of our folk." Aa`ishah had a slave girl from that tribe, and the Prophet , sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said to Aa`ishah, ‘manumit her as she is a descendant of Ismaa`eel, alayhis salaam.’" [Hadeeth no. 2543, 4366 of al-Fath] Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee said, "this hadeeth also contains a clear mention of the excellence and superiority of Bani Tameem." [Fath 5/217] The hadeeth of Ikrimah from one of the Companions reported in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad and in it occurs, "do not say of Bani Tameem anything but good, for indeed they are the severest of people in attacking the Dajjaal." Al-Haythamee says: "its narrators are those ofthe Saheeh." [Mujma 10/48 chpt: What is reported concerning Bani Tameem] It is not strange that Bani Tameem would be the most severe against the Dajjaal, because the tools required to combat him are none but a correct and firm belief and proper beneficial knowledge. Alhumdolillaah many of the scholars of Saudi are from the most noble and skilled scholars on the face of this earth today, firmly upon the way of our noble Messenger, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam. This is what Allaah has allowed me to very quickly put together. And our Lord Most High Knows best. By Clear salafi contradictions on Friday, September 08, 2000 - 02:49 am: Edit By Clear salafi contradictions on Sunday, July 9, 2000 - 01:12 am: Assalamu alaykum It is interesting that the sister quotes from Imam Nawawi and Ibn Hajar Asqalani (may Allah have mercy on them both) to support the argument of the Ahl-ul-Nadj that the Hadith refers to Iraq. I am puzzled because both Imam Nawawi and Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani were of the "deviant"Ashari' aqeeda and thus are considered innovators and beyond the pale by most salafis- why quote from them then -just because its suits your argument? The hadith clearly states Najd - not Iraq -why are salafis now resorting to ta'wil (which they condemn the Ashari's for) to deny its true meaning!! What is you opinion of the hadith where the Prophet(saw) says that the armies of the Dajjal will come from a particular area and he(saw) points to the location where Medina University (established 1974) is currently situated!! It be interested in your response to these points. By Decisive proof on the location of Najd on Friday, September 08, 2000 - 02:48 am: Edit By Decisive proof on the location of Najd on Sunday, July 9, 2000 - 01:28 am: The question was asked: b.. Under what circumstances did the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) first offer the qunut prayer? The answer was given (in the same post): "The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) first made the qunut when 70 Muslim da'ees, who had been sent to teach the tribes of Ra'l, Dhakwan and Usiyyah, were treacherously murdered by them. "These clans had wilfully misled the Prophet into sending 70 of the most able Muslim teachers into a death trap, by claiming they had embraced Islam. The Prophet was extremely saddened by this calamity and invoked Allah's curse and chastisement on these tribes. "The qunut al-nazilah started thus off as an imprecatory prayer, calling Divine punishment on the tyrants who butchered innocent people and the prayer was offered after rising from the ruku (bowing) position in the compulsory daily salah." End of excerpt. The above is all true, but it should be noted that the clans in question were all from Najd, and that the massacre of the Sahaba took place in Najd. `Amir ibn Malik came to the Prophet (SAWS) in the 4th year of the Hijra, neither accepting nor rejecting Islam. Instead he said: "O Muhammad! If you send some of your Companions to the people of Najd to call them to your affair, I have hope that they shall respond favorably to you." The Prophet (SAWS) replied: "Truly I fear for them [harm] from the people of Najd" (inni aksha `alayhim ahla Najd). This establishes without DOUBT that the Prophet(saw) consider Najd to be the Najd of Saudi - The Sahaba's never fought in Iraq during his lifetime(saw) `Amir said: "I proclaim that they are under my protection." The Prophet (SAWS) then sent seventy men from the elite of the Muslims. They travelled until they alighted at the Well of Ma`una, at which time they sent Haram ibn Malhan with the letter of the Messenger of Allah (SAWS) to `Amir ibn al-Tufayl. The latter did not look at the letter but instead killed Haram ibn Malhan. Then he called upon the Banu `Amir for assistance to kill the rest of the Muslim group, but they declined to challenge `Amir ibn Malik's protectorate. So `Amir ibn al-Tufayl called upon the tribes of Sulaym: `Usayya, Ra`l, Dhakwan, and they responded to him. They formed an expedition and surrounded the group with their mounts. The Muslims were killed to the last man but for `Amr ibn Umayya al-Dumari who returned to Madina. The Prophet (SAWS) was deeply affected by their death and remained supplicating (yaqnutu) for one month during the dawn prayer against the Sulaym tribes: Ra`l, Dakwan, Banu Lahyan, and `Usayya. The story is told in Fiqh al-Sira (p. 254-255). By Zubayr on Friday, September 08, 2000 - 02:52 am: Edit By Zubayr on Monday, July 10, 2000 - 01:09 am: Bismillah Reply to 'Clear Salafi Contradiction' As salaamu alaykum I am puzzled because both Imam Nawawi and Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani were of the "deviant"Ashari' aqeeda and thus are considered innovators and beyond the pale by most salafis- why quote from them then -just because its suits your argument? I love to read this type of statement over and over again. Perhaps the statement of Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen regarding these two Shaykhs (May Allah have mercy upon them) is best in this case: "The two shaikhs and preservers of the religion have their place of prominence, honesty and great benefit for the Muslim nation. Even if they made some mistake in reinterpreting some of the texts mentionting the attributes [of Allah], such mistakes are covered and immersed by what they had of virtue and great benefit. We suspect that what they stated was only the result of their own personal ijtihaad and a permissible form of interpretation - at least in their view. I hope from Allah that such are forgiven mistakes; and I hope that the good and benefit that came from them will be efforts that are rewarded and appreciated by Allah; and I hope that Allah's words will apply to them, 'Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds' [Hood 114]. We are of the opinion that they are both from Ahlul Sunnah wal-Jam'aah and this is evidenced by their service to the sunnah of the Messenger (SAAS), their eagerness to purify it from the wrong that had been attributed to it and their implementation of its rulings. They differed from the leaders of Ahlul-Sunnah with respect to some verses and hadeeth concerning attributes [of Allah] based on a mistaken ijtihaad and we hope that Allah will deal with them with forgiveness and pardon." [Kitaab ul-Ilm] So I am sure that the above sure the true position regarding our beloved Imaams (May Allah have mercy upon them) and that taking knowledge from them, particularly in hadeeth, in which they are muhadditheen, is clearly allowed. The hadith clearly states Najd - not Iraq -why are salafis now resorting to ta'wil (which they condemn the Ashari's for) to deny its true meaing!! Where is the tawil?? Do you read our sister, UmNusayba's initial post? Let me quote for you... "3. That at the time of the Prophet, sallaahu alayhis wa sallaam, there were 13 places known as Najd [according to ‘Najd Qarnu ash-Shaytaan’] depending on where one was. This because Najd linguistically means a raised/elevated land. Therefore the Arabs referred to lands that were elevated with respect to them as Najd. One of the most commonly referred to areas as Najd at that time was Iraaq." So we have established that Iraaq was amongst those that were given the name Najd...Next... 4. The Najd for those people living in Madeenah in the direction of the East would be Iraaq. "Ibn Hajr said: "al-Khattaabee said: ‘the najd in the direction of the east, and for the one who is in Madeenah then his Najd would be the desert of Iraaq and it’s regions [baadiya al-Iraaq wa Nawaaheehaa] for this is to the east of the People of Madeenah." So let me weigh this up...the muhadditheen (Imaams of hadeeth of our Islam) say Najd = Iraaq and you say Najd = not Iraaq and of course, what a suprise you give no evidence...Need I say whom we should stick to??! What is you opinion of the hadith where the Prophet(saw) says that the armies of the Dajjal will come from a particular area and he(saw) points to the location where Medina University (established 1974) is currently situated!! Now this one really got me!! I am yet to find a hadeeth (authentic or inauthentic) where the Prophet (SAAS) said that the army of the Dajjal would come from Madinah. All I could find was, Anas ibn Malik : Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: The Dajjal would be followed by seventy thousand Jews of Isfahan wearing Persian shawls. Muslim 7034 Now Isfahan, and please correct if I am wrong, is in Iran. In fact all I could find about the Dajjal and Madinah was ahadeeth of how the Dajjal will be unable to enter it [Bukhari 9/247, 3/103, 9/240 and more]. By Mahi on Friday, September 08, 2000 - 02:59 am: Edit By Mahi on Friday, July 14, 2000 - 02:33 am: Sister Um Nusayba - re point 4: I am well aware of Ibn Hajar's words, and his conclusion is that the word Najd does not refer to a specific place but to the Eastern direction from Madina, and that it lexically means every elevated place, i.e. mountains. Ibn Hajar's conclusion is not that it means Iraq. Anyway, I am surprized that you cling with such insistence to the words of a scholar when we have firsthand evidence from`Umar and Ibn `Abbas (RAA) that the Miqat (place of entering Ihram) for the people of Najd is Qarn al-Manazil, while the Miqat of the people of Iraq is Dhatu `Irqin. If Iraq and Najd are one and the same place, how come their Miqats are two different places? And aside from `Umar and Ibn `Abbas,(may Allah be pleased with them both) did you not read the words of the Prophet (SAWS) himself when he made du`a al-qunut against the Sulaym clans of Najd: Ra‘l, Dakwan, Banu Lahyan, and ‘Usayya tribes? Were these tribes in Iraq? Ibn Hajar said "And the first of the trials that arose, arose from the direction of the east ...." The first great fitna that came from the East was Musaylima the Liar from the Banu Hanifa tribes in Yamama. Was this in Iraq? Of course the most recent fitna which came from Najd was when the wretched Saud clan and Abdul Wahab colluded with the British and rebelled against the legitamate Caliph of the day ( The Wahabbis colluding with kuffar against muslims ?!? sounds familiar..? Gulf War 1991, Southern Sudan, OPEC, etc, etc) And of course the CIA-funded secular "Saudi Salafi" dawa is weakening and causing great fitna amongst the Muslims all over the world in our own time As Ibn Hajar said about the Nejdis "... and they were the reason for the splitting of the Muslim ranks, and this is what Satan loves and delights in". As well as the two posts to your original message these are other strong proofs that you evidently are not aware of or choose to ignore wasalaam Your brother By Abuz-Zubair al-'Azzami (Admin) on Thursday, September 07, 2000 - 10:06 pm: Edit By Abuz-Zubair al-'Azzami (Admin) on Wednesday, July 19, 2000 - 02:33 am: as-Salaamu 'Alaikum brother Mahi. You said: I don't think you are well aware of what Ibn Hajr has said in Fath, for if you were, then I wonder how, the explicit mentioning of Iraaq, can escape your eyes! Why not mention the Hadeeth which Ibn hajr quotes from Saheeh Muslim, narrated by Saalim Ibn Abdillah Ibn 'Umar - may Allah be pleased with them both - who said: "O people of 'Iraaq! You enquire about minor sins, while commit major sins! I heard my father, 'Abdullah Ibn 'Umar say, "I heard the Messenger of Allah SAW say: Indeed the Fitnah will come from right here! and he pointed with his hand towards the east, where the horn of Satan will arise" (Fath 13/59) Why did Ibn Hajr pick a Hadeeth in reference to Iraaq and place it under the topic of the Hadeeth of Najd, if Najd and Iraaq are two seperate places? As for your statement: Here you are mixing the practicalities of Hajj, with the Hadeeth regarding fitan, where Ibn Hajr has explicitly quoted a narration and statements of the Salaf explicitly saying that "the direction of east" is understood to be in the direction of Iraaq. So when the intent of "Najd" is already explained then why refer to a totally different chapter, and pick out a Hadeeth totally irrelevant to the topic, in order to cover up what has already been established by Ibn Hajr? Seondly, even when Ibn Hajr opined that "Najd" is any elevated land, then what gave you the right to restrict Najd to the Arabian peninsula? Then you totally misquote Ibn Hajr, knowing fully well the deception you are playing... and you say: Why not end the quote of Ibn Hajr? Why shy away from it? Let me complete the quote of Ibn Hajr for you... "The first of the Fitan was from the direction of the east, which was due to split amongst the Muslims, and that is from what Shaitaan loves and becomes happy with" As you can clearly see, Ibn Hajr is talking about the "fitnah" and NOT the blessed Jihaad that took place between Abu Bakr and Musaylimah the liar - as you falsely claimed, which is further affirmed by Ibn Hajr when he says, "which was due to split amongst the Muslims". Do you regard the fighting between the Muslims and the apostate army of Musaylimah to be a split amongst the Muslims? I really hope not, because the fight between Musaylimah and Abu Bakr ra is regarded to be Jihaad by the Ijmaa, and not fitnah. Rather the first fitnah that Ibn Hajr is talking about is the Fitnah of the Khawaarij, who broke away from 'Alee ra and refused to follow him to Koofah, and stopped at a place called Huroorah, close to Koofah in 'Iraaq. They were were the first innovators in the Islaamic history, and the first sect amongst the Muslims. This is further confirmed by Ibn Hajr when he goes on to say, "Similarly, Bid'a appeared from that area". It is a fact that the Khawaarij came from 'Iraaq, the Shi'ah came from 'Iraaq, the Murji`ah came from 'Iraaq, the Mu'tazilah, Qadariyah and in our time, Ba'athiyah, they all came from 'Iraaq. I say that you intentionally misquoted Ibn Hajr, because there wasn't a paragraph or two between the statement, "And the first of the trials that arose, arose from the direction of the east ...." and the continuation of that statement which you yourself quoted near the end of your post where he said, "... and they were the reason for the splitting of the Muslim ranks, and this is what Satan loves and delights in". This shows that you were fully aware of the entire statement, but you chose to cut-and-paste to change the intended meaning, may Allah forgive us all. Then you say: I think you need to revise your history, as the British never got involved with Aal-Sa'ud until the begining of this century. So Sheikh Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahhaab, is free of what you have said. I think Sheikh 'Alee at-Tamimi's refutation of al-Mas'ari should be sufficient to refute this point, when he says: "(7) On page 127, Al-Mass'ari cites two works which supposedly prove that the first Saudi state under the leadership of Abdul-Aziz b.Muhammad b. Sa'ud had connections with the British. First of all this was the original reason for my first post. There I showed that contrary to Zalloum's thesis the British were supportive of the Gulf shaikhs who fought against Al-Sa'ud and the (for lack of a more expressive term) "Wahhabi" da'wa. I am not familiar with either book or author. I also have my doubts as the history of the period is pretty well documented. Moreover the opponents of Ibn Abdul-Wahhab and the Al-Sa'ud left no stone overturned to find something against them. Surely had such a connection been there they would have cited it. The first time one hears of connections between the British and Al-Sa'ud is during the rise of third state at the beginning of this century. In response to these allegations refer to Ibn Sahman's ad-Diya' ash-Shairq, p. 146." Then you say: I wonder, Sheikh Safar bin Abdir-Rahmaan al-Hawaali, who wrote his thesis on secularism is CIA funded? Sheikh Salmaan bin Fahd al-Awdah, is CIA funded? Sheikh Muhammad al-Maqdisi is CIA funded? Bin Laadin, CIA funded? Khattaab, CIA funded? In fact, I would challenge you to inform me of a land of Jihaad, where the foreign Mujahideen happen to be anything other then the Wahhaabis/Salafis. Then you say: This has been refuted above, where I showed how you cut-and-paste Ibn Hajr's words to change the intended meaning. Besides, why not also quote the Hadeeth of the Prophet SAW that the toughest people against the Dajjaal will be Banu Tameem, who are the "Najdis"?? And then you state: Talk about pot calling the kettle black! Here you are, claiming to have studied the words of Ibn Hajr, yet are hiding so much of what he mentions, then deliberately misquoting Ibn Hajr to alter the intended meaning, topped up by your ignorance of the History in general, then claiming that we "choose to ignore" so-called "strong proofs" that we are not aware of. Enough said... May Allah guide us to the truth. was-Salaamu 'Alaikum By haq on Friday, September 08, 2000 - 03:05 am: Edit By haq on Wednesday, July 19, 2000 - 04:00 pm: i totally disagree with the above statments because the prophet (saw) did mean najd when he pointed towords the east and way should the prophet(saw)mean iraq when so many renowned scholors where lived there one such is sheike abdul qadir (ra)and also why did hazrat Ali (may Allah be pleased with him)move the capital of islamic empire to iraq if he knew that the horn of satan gone grow there. and iknow for fact the hazrat ali (ra) had mach more ilm then any man born today By Muslim on Thursday, September 07, 2000 - 10:24 pm: Edit By Muslim on Wednesday, July 19, 2000 - 07:36 pm: Ibn Taymiyya on th meaning of "Najd" Salaams Hope this contributes to our understanding IBN TAYMIYYA ON THE MEANING OF "NAJD" Q. Did Ibn Taymiyya understand Najd in the hadith to mean Iraq? A. No. Ibn Taymiyya always differentiates between Najd and Iraq although acknowledging they both lie East of Madina in the language of the people of Madina: "They would call the people of Najd *and* Iraq 'the people of the East' (ahl al-mashriq)," "The people of al-Sham are the people of the West (al-gharb) just as Najd *and* Iraq are the beginning of the East."1 Elsewhere he states: "The texts affirming the superiority of the people of Sham to those of Najd *and* Iraq and the rest of the people of the East are more than can be counted."2 If Najd meant Iraq, it would be redundant to say "Najd and Iraq" and one would have to say, more correctly, "Najd, meaning Iraq." Ibn Taymiyya also cites the report of Ibn 'Abbas who said: "The first Jumu'a that gathered in Islam after the Jumu'a of Madina was that of Jawathi, one of the towns of al-Bahrayn. They said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Between us and you are those regions of the disbelievers of Mudar, and [we] cannot come to you except in a sacred month. Therefore give us a decisive order which we might put into practice and by which we shall call those who are behind us.' Meaning: the people of Najd such as [the tribes of] Tamim, Asad, Ghatafan, and others."3 And again: "The delegation of 'Abd al-Qays was one of the best delegations ever to come to the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him -... and they said: 'Between us and you there are those regions of the disbelievers of Mudar - and they meant Najd - and we cannot reach you except during a sacred month.'"4 And again: "The delegation of 'Abd al-Qays came to the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him -... and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Between us and you there are those regions of the disbelievers of Mudar' - meaning by that, the people of Najd such as Tamim, Asad, and Ghatafan, because those were between al-Bahrayn and al-Madina, while 'Abd al-Qays are from Rabi'a and not from Mudar."5 Bahrayn is far from Iraq; in fact, a line drawn from Bahrayn to Madina would pass slightly higher than Riyad, the capital of present-day Najd. Elsewhere Ibn Taymiyya counts among the tribes of Najd "Banu Asad, Ashja', Fazara, and others of the tribes of Najd."6 These are not Iraqi but Najdi tribes. He also said: "Those that committed apostasy after his death - Allah bless and greet him - were only those that entered Islam with the sword, such as the companions of Musaylima and the peole of Najd."7 This cannot mean Iraq since, at the time the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - left this world, Islam had not yeat reached Iraq.

10	9	Imams of Haramain....	amani	Amani	sudais_fan Abdullah, i dont think any driving could beat indian driving, never been but from what i`ve heard, if u can drive in india, u could drive anywhere!! U met sheikh Abdul Aziz al Shaikh? man, u r soooo lucky, u gonna meet sheikh fowzan aswell??? i heard riyadh is more stricter than in jeddah, but i guess in a way the stricter the better!! u have to agree, some arabs are arrogant, but i guess in all cultures theres always the good the bad and the ugly! thats what people around me dont seem to understand. they all generalise arabs as bad, but they`ve stopped that around me now!!! met any royals yet? u may not have noticed this, cos ur a man, but when i went there, i was disappointed to see a lot of men staring and following. that can be scary. in that sense england is not as bad! anyway i wish u have a really nice time there. Dont be too bad. and when u meet sheikh shuraim please see if he has a cough. a muslim brother. yeh u can get recitation from masjid e nabawi. just type in google what ur looking for. By Abdullah on Saturday, April 17, 2004 - 05:08 pm: Edit Assalamo-alaikum-wa-rahmtullah-hey-wbrkatu Sudais_Fan - forgot to mention that Shiekh Fowzan was there also on Thursday night - he had an answer/question session before Isha and then Mufti Al Sheikh did a speech after Isha! I know what u mean when you say that the arabs are arrogant but I think from my experience that this is just a front and once u get to know them they are very hospitable and friendly! Like you said you get all sorts of people - at least arabs do it 2 ur face whereas the Brits they tend to be sweet 2 ur face and backbite instead! As for the men staring at the women that is true and to be expected!!!!! BUT, I have also noticed that women are no better here in Riyadh (from personal experience) and they even pass comment!!!!!!!! ASTAGFIRULLAH may allah guide us -ameen As for meeting Royals have not met anyone yet - although to be honest I could'nt careless if I did or didnt!!! Abdullah - SAUDI CORRESPONDENT!!!! By ... on Sunday, April 18, 2004 - 12:22 am: Edit salamz.. yh it it is annoyin downloadin the stuff from aswatalislam.net... congrats bro abdullah! lol also....ask shuraim wen he cummin down to england! w'salam By ... on Sunday, April 18, 2004 - 01:07 pm: Edit salams... i have many arab friends... and people have said to me that they dont like arabs cos they dont like pakistanis.. :s... i dont think that is true? :S and abdullah.. you're right.. once you get to know them properly... they are very nice.. By shuraimfan on Sunday, April 18, 2004 - 09:20 pm: Edit salaam, In my opinion shuraim is number one, but i also really like sheikh qasim of medinah. His recitation is amazing mashallah! anyone else like him? Ive looked on the net for his recitation, but all of them seem to be of when he was younger. Anyone know where u can get recent recitations of him? By sudais_fan on Monday, April 19, 2004 - 12:59 pm: Edit ... some arabs dont like pakistanis, and bangladeshis for that matter, aswell as indians. however that is because in arab countires they do all the low work. however no matter how long a foriegner stays in saudi they will never get saudi nationality, which is not right. shuraimfan, i have heard sheikh abdul muhsin, he prays nice from what i`ve heard, but i couldnt tell the difference between him younger, and now cos i dont listen to him much. sorrry By Abdurrahman on Monday, April 19, 2004 - 04:23 pm: Edit As-salaamu 'alaykum, "ShuraimFan", this is definitely the latest if you want to listen to the latest Ramadhan (1424) recording in Masjid an-Nabawiyy: http://www.liveislam.com/archi/1424/ramadan.htm. By the way, 5 imaams recited there so you'll have to find the qiraa-ah of Shaykh Muhsin Abu Al-Qaasim yourself. Abdullah, Alhamdulillah, you are in a better place than the rest of us. Keep us updated on when you meet the Shuyookh, especially ash-Shuraym. I trust you will not ask him about his (non-existent) cough (as one person suggests) because we all know that's rude. I have a couple of more relevant questions that you could ask the shaykh when you meet him, Insha-Allah: o How does he come up with different tunes all the time? (Every year there's an addition to the collection and there was a complete change (inc. surat al-Faatihah) on the 30th night of Ramadhan 1419 (both in taraweeh and qiyaam al-layl - I have one rak'ah of the recording) - mention this particular tune as well if you get the chance!) o Who are the Shuyookh from whom he derives inspiration in his qiraa-ah? (Obviously he has his uniqueness but in some parts of his tune he has some similarity to Shaykh al-Huzayfee and Shaykh Ali Jabir) Jazaak Allah Khayraa and I hope everything's well there, Insha-Allah. Was-salaamu 'alaykum Abdurrahman By norazizah on Monday, April 19, 2004 - 05:05 pm: Edit Assalamulaikum Muslimbrother, Hope some of your questions answered: 1.aswatalislam has the audio of Quran recitation of many recitors including one entitled "recitation from al masjid al nabawy." 2. Sheikh Ayoub has been at Masjid Nabawy for many many Ramadan and read the doa(This is true) until few years back. I was told he's incharge of Masjid Quba. Allah knows the truth. From my experience, Unlike Makkah,doa is recited by few distinct Imam of Masjid Nabawy interchangbly. 3.Voices of Imam changes with time ( like evrything else). Look at he dates on whatever CD or Cassete you buy to be sure. If theres no date they can mixed the years. So long Wassalam By norazizah on Tuesday, April 20, 2004 - 07:29 am: Edit Brother Abdullah...Assalamualaikum, hope you and your family have adjusted to living and working in the new environment.(It takes time).May Allah takes care of you all. later,when you manage to visit Shuraim kindly ask these 3 questions for me. 1. What doa did he read during the long sujud in Solat Tahajud? Share with us (2).I have his arabic khutbah set published by Dar-Al-Wattan, my question now...any new publication since 1421 H ? Love to have it. and (3) please ask him to make doa that I too can be a successful writer (in my area) Jazakallah khir brother Abdullah. Salam from norazizah. By Abdullah on Tuesday, April 20, 2004 - 02:08 pm: Edit Assalamo-alaikum-wa-rahmtullah-hey-wbrkatu Well here it is - I have managed to get some detailed information on Sheikh Sudais - (thanks to a little translational help from some Saudi Colleagues!!!!) Enjoy - no doubt Sudais_Fan will be eager to read this so I will shut up and let you read! I am currently working on a similar thing for Sheikh Shuraim. Abdullah *****Biography of Dr Abdul Rehman Al Sudais******* His lineage is ABU ABDUL AZIZ Ibn ABDUL AZIZ bin ABDULLAH, bin ABDUL AZIZ bin MUHAMMAD bin ABDULLAH and he is from the famous tribe of ANZA. He was born in Riyadh in 1382 hijri and his father enrolled him to become hafiz in a mosque in Riyadh which was headed by Shiekh Abdul Rehman bin Abdullah Al Faryan. He was also taught the quran by Sheikh Muhammed Abdul Majid Zakir and also various others including Al Sheikh Muhammed Ali Hassan. At the age of 12 he completed his hafiz studies. Dr Sudais grew up in Riyadh and attended the Al Mathna Bin Hartha elementry school and also the Scientific Academy of Riyadh - he is one of the most famous students from there. He graduated from the Scientific Academy in 1399 with a grading EXCELLENT and then went on to the Al Sharia College. After this he became Imam and Khateeb of a mosque in Riyadh called Masjid Al Sheikh Al Allama Abdur Razzaq Al Afifi. At the same time he started teaching in the Academy of Imam Al Dawa Al Almy in 1404 and which time he was also appointed the Imam and Khateeb of Masjidal Haram in Mecca Mukarrama. He started his Imamat in Mecca on the 22/08/1404 leading the Asr salat, and his first Khutba to the people was on the 15/09/1404 which was in ramadhan. In 1408 he got his masters (grading EXCELLENT) from the College of Sharia in the Islamic University of Imam Muhammed Bin Sauood. His thesis was titled “AL MASAIL AL ASOOLIYA AL MUTALIKA BIL ADALA AL SHARIA” meaning how masails are exctracted based on the evidence of shariah. This thesis opposed the work of Ibn Khadamal Khazari. He then moved on to work as assistant teacher in the Umm Ul Qura University in Mecca from where he also obtained his doctorate from the College of Sharia (grading excellent in 1416. He was then appointed a lecturer in the College of Sharia at the Umm Ul Qura University, which is also his current position. And Allah knows best! By Abdullah on Tuesday, April 20, 2004 - 02:20 pm: Edit Brother Abdurrahman - inshallah I will ask your questions when I meet Sheikh Shuraim. Don't worry I won't be asking any stupid questions as they are Ulema and we have to show utmost respect to them - HOWEVER, I think that the comments made on here are light hearted humour and don't have any malice or disrespect in them (that is my personal opinion). I can understand some people may get offended but we are all adults and allhumdolillah muslims so lets show the utmost respect to each other as we all have faults and no one is perfect - may allah guide us all. I hope you all found the Shaykh Sudais biography interesting. Just a simple request please remember me in your duaas. Wassalam Abdullah By sudais_fan on Tuesday, April 20, 2004 - 04:25 pm: Edit abdul rahman regarding the cough. i didnt mean he should ask about his cough, i meant he should see if he has a cough. reason being i am 100% determined to send honey as a present one of these days. iwasnt being rude!!!! also regarding tunes. from what i`ve seen and heard of different people, tunes come out naturally, like when ur praying u dont think of a certain tune, u just pray as a flow (does that make sense?) and so, maybe they have intention of praying one way, and it comes out another way, they cant backtrack it, know what i mean? Abdullah, ur gonna have so many questions for him, hes gonna think ur crazy!!!!! By ... on Tuesday, April 20, 2004 - 08:28 pm: Edit salamz! ALHAMDULLILAH im back in the UK and inshallah will be able to watch prayers!! shuraim fan.. even i think shuraim is no1 lol... and after him.. i think salih al talib is really good... By ... on Wednesday, April 21, 2004 - 02:19 am: Edit abdullah.. the biography was pretty interesting... and get the biography of shuraim as soon as possible plz.. sudais fan ... i didnt mean he should ask about his cough, ''i meant he should see if he has a cough'' the bit in the speech marks... i thought was a bit funny.. wouldnt he already know him self hes got a cough? :P w'salam By shuraimfan on Wednesday, April 21, 2004 - 04:32 pm: Edit salaams, Thank you Abdullah for that website. I couldnt find sheikh Qasim on the list, maybe he dosent lead taraweeh? By Servant of Allah on Wednesday, April 21, 2004 - 05:00 pm: Edit Assalamu Alaikum... Brother Abdullah, Please also ask Dr. Shaikh Shuraim if he teaches the Holy Qur'an to boys. I would really like to recite to him. JazakAllah Servant of Allah By sudais_fan on Thursday, April 22, 2004 - 02:18 am: Edit abdullah, did i enjoy the biography?? im gonna have that printed out and make everyone i know read it (cos everyone knows i`m a bit sheikh mad anyways) also, i`ve ordered the madinah islamic university books on arabic, hoping to study that so i get to know arabic. regarding sheikh fowzan, has he got a ginger beard (dont worry im gonna explain why i ask, so that i dont hurt any feelings) the reason why i ask is becasue recently after a couple of jummah they have like a talk session regarding islam and im 99% sure its sheikh fowzan, but i`ve missed the first part of his name both times, and theres more than one sheikh saleh al fowzan, so since u`ve seen him, can u please tell me. anyways, when u make making the big visit???? ... regarding the cough... its causing a bit of problems. i asked abdullah to chek and see if sheikh shuraim had a cough at the time of his meeting. Abdul Rahman, sed it was rude to ask if hehas a cough. i replied to abdul Rahman saying that i meant that abdullah should see if he has a cough, not ask. By sudais_fan on Thursday, April 22, 2004 - 02:22 am: Edit forgive me if the answers realllly obvious, but who is ibn khadamal khazari?????? By Abdurrahman on Thursday, April 22, 2004 - 10:13 am: Edit As-salaamu 'alaykum Tunes are an art and, even though it may seem that a recitor is flowing naturally, some effort has to be exerted to acquire a correct tune. How many times have you heard people recite with a dodgy tune? Shaykh ash-Shuraym is an expert in tunes. One only needs to listen to all the different taraweehs he has recited in Makkah as well as when he was in Riyadh (as far as I know). His tunes are different each time and each year he adds a new type of tune to his collection. Some times (as I mentioned in my precious post) he changes his tune completely or purposely adds a new style (both for which I have proof). Was-salaamu 'alaykum Abdurrahman By Abdurrahman on Thursday, April 22, 2004 - 11:21 am: Edit As-salaamu 'alaykum Abdullah, The car bomb must have happened quite close to where you live. I hope everything's ok, Insha-Allah. Unfortunately, the ones involved - through lack of knowledge - are carrying out attacks on Muslims on Muslim lands. How can a Muslim even think that such an act could be justified Islamically (assuming it is Muslims behind them)? May Allah grant the Muslim Ummah relief from its sufferings! Was-salaamu 'alaykum Abdurrahman By sudais_fan on Friday, April 23, 2004 - 11:23 am: Edit Abdul Rahman, i just believe that when u pray it so often, u dont concentrate so much on the tunes, u just pray nicely, know what i mean? but i think at first i misinterpreted u thinking u were talking only about a few different times, not a whole loada years! also, wasnt it a coincidence that the us warned about terror attacks first?! i bet its rite tense there. waiting for khutbah now, hope its sheikh saleh al talib. hant heard him for a while! By sudais_fan on Friday, April 23, 2004 - 11:59 am: Edit turned out to be sheikh sudais. he sounds well angry!!!! By shuraimfan on Friday, April 23, 2004 - 06:48 pm: Edit Salaams, I remember someone giving out a link to shuraim's biography which was written in arabic. Could someone please give that link again, as i wanted to ask someone to translate it into english for me. Jazakhallah By Abdullah on Saturday, April 24, 2004 - 09:52 am: Edit Assalamo-alaikum-wa-rahmtullah-hey-wbrkatu Brother Abdurrahman thanks for your concern allhumdolillah I am fine and well - the bombing was at a compound near the Interior Ministry which is about 3 miles from our building. Anyway, death is certain and when your time comes you will go no matter where you are or who you are!!!! I just pray that when the time for death comes it is with full Iman and in Al Haramain Sharafain - ameen. There is a lot of tension here in Saudi and there are various programmes and speeches throughout the Kingdom condemning the attacks especially by the scholars! Glad you all enjoyed the Sudais biography as I said I am working on the Shuraim one and will have that soon - inshallah. Sudais_Fan - I am not sure who Khadamal Khazri is I persume he is a scholar who Dr Sudais answered his thoughts/views via his thesis and based on his findings. I did not see what Shiekh Fowzan looked like as he was too far so I can't really say next time I go I will find out inshallah and meet him! I am planning on going to Mecca for Umrah in 2 weeks time - we are at present trying to arrange a meeting with Shiekh Shuraim but he is soooooooooooooooo busy - but inshallah will sort something out! I will also ask him about whether he prays in tune knowingly/with effort or it is just something that is natural! I hope I have answered everyone's questions please forgive me if I have not as I did not have much time online! Noraziah - don't worry I will also ask your questions inshallah! Wassalam and please remember me in your duaas inshallah. Abdullah By norazizah on Saturday, April 24, 2004 - 06:28 pm: Edit Assalamualikum, everyone Alhamdulillah Abdullah is safe.I will make doa for him. While waiting for Shuraim's biography from him,heres what little I know about Sheikh Dr. Saud Ash Shuraim. Name: Saud bin Ibrahim bin Muhammad Ash Shuraim Born : in Riyadh 1386H:A Saudi citizen of course. Ancestor: from Qabilah Qhitan of Shaqra, Najad 1404: completed second school edu.(North Yarmuk ) 1404-1409: successfully studied Usulluddin at Univ(Jameah Al Imam Muhammad bin Saud Al Islamiah in Riyadh.) 1412: Obtained Masters Degree and appointed Imam and Khatib of Masjidilharam. 1413: appointed Kadhi at Mahkamah Kubra Makkah 1416: Got his Doctorate from Ummul Qura.Univ Makkah.His research:Al Masalik fi al Manasik. , Achieved Talaqi (direct learning)from many many renowned scholars eg.

Dr. Shuraim has many outstanding publications..( we will learn more about him from Abdullah soon Insha Allah..) May Allah give safety to the Imam and we all in the Fan club. Wassalam. By ... on Sunday, April 25, 2004 - 07:19 pm: Edit assalamu alaikum hey brother abdullah... can you get a biography on sheikh salih al talib aswell? By sudais_fan on Monday, April 26, 2004 - 12:56 pm: Edit ... u know, i`ve searched on the net for any info on sheikh saleh but cant seem to find any!!! abdullah, if u dont find this too weird a question, what is the saudi equivalent to englands `haulage` company???? as in the transport trucks have which name written on it??? By Muslim Brother on Tuesday, April 27, 2004 - 04:19 pm: Edit Abdullah, Can you kindly ask Sh. Shuraim what Madhab he follows? I know i've i heard people say he is Hambali but when i tell people they dont believe me and say that he and other imams of Haram are Salafis. So if it comes from his own mouth it would shut others up a little. Jazakallah By Ismaeel Syed AbdulHameed on Tuesday, April 27, 2004 - 05:43 am: Edit Assalaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah Subhanalllah, all reciters of Quran are good. But the best I would prefer is Sheikh Saleh Al-Talib. You feel like crying while listening to his recitation. He has a beautiful voice. He led the last 10 days of Taraweeh this year.	2004	04	28	2004-04-28 00:00:00.000

100000	11955	Islam critic and evangelist author charged with arson [Anis Shorrosh]	isma-eel	Isma'eel	The guy claimed that there were grammatical errors in the Qur'an, but when one of the audience asked him to recite a few Aayaat it turned out the fool couldn't even read proper Arabic. The Audience member had to correct every other second, untill he got frustrated and yelled "I am NOT a scholar in the Arabic language", or something of that nature loool... Why oh WHY did he then claim that there were Grammatical errors in the Qur'an? With which authority?? I think this was in a debate with Dr. Jamal Badawi. True, he got owned by Sheikh Ahmad Deedat (Rahimahullah) esepcially in their first debate. Then in the second debate he decided to switch tactics and came wearing traditional bedouin clothes. He also kept mentioning that the Qur'an was in his mother-tongue, as if to say that he had a better understanding of it than Ahmad Deedat (Rah.). But when he was asked to recite, again he could not read properly. This guy is pure filth. Ahmad Deedat exposed him when he read from his book, that he was blaming the Palestinians (his ppl) of not being generous enough with their land and being too selfish, because they do not want to share with their jewish "brothers".	2008	05	03	2008-05-03 00:00:00.000

100006	11980	Can bid'ah be Sunnah?	isma-eel	Isma'eel	Isn't this basically what the sufis, Ash'aris and those who promote the idea of "bid'ah hasana" believe? Why else would they refer to themselves as Ahl Al-Sunnah when they follow a thousand bida3??? I never understood this. Because the way I see it, Sunnah is following the way of the Prophet (saw). If you introduce bida3 into Sunnah, then logic should tell us that it would no longer be "pure Sunnah" (atleast not the authentic Sunnah of Muhammad (saw)). It would be tainted. And these innovations would with time replace some of the genuine Sunnah practices because the line between what is Sunnah and what is Bid3a would become blurred and eventually disappear. I am trying to understand, what gives Ash'ariyya/Maturidiyya/Sufis and others the right to claim the title "Ahl al-Sunnah", when they openly promote bida3 under the guise of "Bid3a hasana"?? What are their arguments? I haven't been able to find any. This makes absolutely no sense to me. That is why it ticks me off when I see them discussing whether Salafiyya are Ahl As-Sunnah or not.	2008	05	03	2008-05-03 00:00:00.000
100012	11980	Can bid'ah be Sunnah?	greenshirt	greenshirt	asalaamu alaikum i agree, it makes no sense what the sufi's claim.

It is in surah 5 though im not sure the ayat. if it is perfect, there is no need for change, because it is 100% perfect! any change would mean it is not perfect. the verse is clear that Allah(swt)'s religion is perfect and there is no need for change! anyways i look forward to seeing what the sufi's have to say. wa salaam	2008	05	03	2008-05-03 00:00:00.000
